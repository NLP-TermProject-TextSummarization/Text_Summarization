        "article": "additive models @xcite provide an important family of models for semiparametric regression or classification . some reasons for the success of additive models are their increased flexibility when compared to linear or generalized linear models and their increased interpretability when compared to fully nonparametric models . \n it is well - known that good estimators in additive models are in general less prone to the curse of high dimensionality than good estimators in fully nonparametric models . \n many examples of such estimators belong to the large class of regularized kernel based methods over a reproducing kernel hilbert space @xmath0 , see e.g. @xcite . in the last years \n many interesting results on learning rates of regularized kernel based models for additive models have been published when the focus is on sparsity and when the classical least squares loss function is used , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein . of course , the least squares loss function is differentiable and has many nice mathematical properties , but it is only locally lipschitz continuous and therefore regularized kernel based methods based on this loss function typically suffer on bad statistical robustness properties , even if the kernel is bounded . \n this is in sharp contrast to kernel methods based on a lipschitz continuous loss function and on a bounded loss function , where results on upper bounds for the maxbias bias and on a bounded influence function are known , see e.g. @xcite for the general case and @xcite for additive models . \n therefore , we will here consider the case of regularized kernel based methods based on a general convex and lipschitz continuous loss function , on a general kernel , and on the classical regularizing term @xmath1 for some @xmath2 which is a smoothness penalty but not a sparsity penalty , see e.g. @xcite . \n such regularized kernel based methods are now often called support vector machines ( svms ) , although the notation was historically used for such methods based on the special hinge loss function and for special kernels only , we refer to @xcite .    in this paper we address the open question , whether an svm with an additive kernel can provide a substantially better learning rate in high dimensions than an svm with a general kernel , say a classical gaussian rbf kernel , if the assumption of an additive model is satisfied . \n our leading example covers learning rates for quantile regression based on the lipschitz continuous but non - differentiable pinball loss function , which is also called check function in the literature , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for parametric quantile regression and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for kernel based quantile regression . \n we will not address the question how to check whether the assumption of an additive model is satisfied because this would be a topic of a paper of its own . \n of course , a practical approach might be to fit both models and compare their risks evaluated for test data . \n for the same reason we will also not cover sparsity . \n consistency of support vector machines generated by additive kernels for additive models was considered in @xcite . in this paper \n we establish learning rates for these algorithms . \n let us recall the framework with a complete separable metric space @xmath3 as the input space and a closed subset @xmath4 of @xmath5 as the output space . \n a borel probability measure @xmath6 on @xmath7 is used to model the learning problem and an independent and identically distributed sample @xmath8 is drawn according to @xmath6 for learning . \n a loss function @xmath9 is used to measure the quality of a prediction function @xmath10 by the local error @xmath11 . \n _ throughout the paper we assume that @xmath12 is measurable , @xmath13 , convex with respect to the third variable , and uniformly lipschitz continuous satisfying @xmath14 with a finite constant @xmath15 . \n _    support vector machines ( svms ) considered here are kernel - based regularization schemes in a reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) @xmath0 generated by a mercer kernel @xmath16 . with a shifted loss function @xmath17 introduced for dealing \n even with heavy - tailed distributions as @xmath18 , they take the form @xmath19 where for a general borel measure @xmath20 on @xmath21 , the function @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a regularization parameter . \n the idea to shift a loss function has a long history , see e.g. @xcite in the context of m - estimators . \n it was shown in @xcite that @xmath22 is also a minimizer of the following optimization problem involving the original loss function @xmath12 if a minimizer exists : @xmath25    the additive model we consider consists of the _ input space decomposition _ \n @xmath26 with each @xmath27 a complete separable metric space and a _ hypothesis space _ \n @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a set of functions @xmath30 each of which is also identified as a map @xmath31 from @xmath3 to @xmath5 . \n hence the functions from @xmath32 take the additive form @xmath33 . \n we mention , that there is strictly speaking a notational problem here , because in the previous formula each quantity @xmath34 is an element of the set @xmath35 which is a subset of the full input space @xmath36 , @xmath37 , whereas in the definition of sample @xmath8 each quantity @xmath38 is an element of the full input space @xmath36 , where @xmath39 . \n because these notations will only be used in different places and because we do not expect any misunderstandings , we think this notation is easier and more intuitive than specifying these quantities with different symbols . \n the additive kernel @xmath40 is defined in terms of mercer kernels @xmath41 on @xmath27 as @xmath42 it generates an rkhs @xmath0 which can be written in terms of the rkhs @xmath43 generated by @xmath41 on @xmath27 corresponding to the form ( [ additive ] ) as @xmath44 with norm given by @xmath45 the norm of @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47    to illustrate advantages of additive models , we provide two examples of comparing additive with product kernels . \n the first example deals with gaussian rbf kernels . \n all proofs will be given in section [ proofsection ] . \n [ gaussadd ] let

standard gaussian rbf kernel @xmath63 . \n the second example is about sobolev kernels . \n [ sobolvadd ] let @xmath64 , @xmath65 $ ] and @xmath58^s.$ ] let @xmath66 : = \\bigl\\{u\\in l_2([0,1 ] ) ;

\n it is an rkhs with a mercer kernel @xmath67 defined on @xmath68 ^ 2 $ ] . \n if we take all the mercer kernels @xmath69 to be @xmath67 , then @xmath70 $ ] for each @xmath71 . \n the additive kernel

derivatives are all square integrable , contains discontinuous functions and is not an rkhs . \n denote the marginal distribution of @xmath6 on @xmath27 as @xmath75 . under the assumption that @xmath76 for each @xmath71 and that @xmath43 is dense in @xmath29 in the @xmath77-metric , it was proved in @xcite that @xmath78 in probability as long as @xmath79 satisfies @xmath80 and @xmath81 . \n the rest of the paper has the following structure . \n section [ ratessection ] contains our main results on learning rates for svms based on additive kernels . learning rates for quantile regression \n are treated as important special cases . \n section [ comparisonsection ] contains a comparison of our results with other learning rates published recently . \n section [ proofsection ] contains all the proofs and some results which can be interesting in their own . \n in this paper we provide some learning rates for the support vector machines generated by additive kernels for additive models which helps improve the quantitative understanding presented in @xcite . \n the rates are about asymptotic behaviors of the excess risk @xmath82 and take the form @xmath83 with @xmath84 . \n they will be stated under three kinds of conditions involving the hypothesis space @xmath0 , the measure @xmath6 , the loss @xmath12 , and the choice of the regularization parameter @xmath85 . \n the first condition is about the approximation ability of the hypothesis space @xmath0 . \n since the output function @xmath19 is from the hypothesis space , the learning rates of the learning algorithm depend on the approximation ability of the hypothesis space @xmath0 with respect to the optimal risk @xmath86 measured by the following approximation error . \n [ defapprox ] the approximation error of the triple @xmath87 is defined as @xmath88    to estimate the approximation error , we make an assumption about the minimizer of the risk @xmath89    for each @xmath90 , define the integral operator @xmath91 associated with the kernel @xmath41 by @xmath92 we mention that @xmath93 is a compact and positive operator on @xmath94 . hence we can find its normalized eigenpairs @xmath95 such that @xmath96 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath94 and @xmath97 as @xmath98 . fix @xmath99 . \n then we can define the @xmath100-th power @xmath101 of @xmath93 by @xmath102 this is a positive and bounded operator and its range is well - defined . \n the assumption @xmath103 means @xmath104 lies in this range . \n [ assumption1 ] we assume @xmath105 and @xmath106 where for some @xmath107 and each @xmath108 , @xmath109 is a function of the form @xmath110 with some @xmath111 . \n the case @xmath112 of assumption [ assumption1 ] means each @xmath113 lies in the rkhs @xmath43 . \n a standard condition in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) for achieving decays of the form @xmath114 for the approximation error ( [ approxerrordef ] ) is @xmath115 with some @xmath116 . here \n the operator @xmath117 is defined by @xmath118 in general , this can not be written in an additive form . \n however , the hypothesis space ( [ additive ] ) takes an additive form @xmath119 . \n so it is natural for us to impose an additive expression @xmath120 for the target function @xmath121 with the component functions @xmath113 satisfying the power condition @xmath110 . \n the above natural assumption leads to a technical difficulty in estimating the approximation error : the function @xmath113 has no direct connection to the marginal distribution @xmath122 projected onto @xmath27 , hence existing methods in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) can not be applied directly . \n note that on the product space @xmath123 , there is no natural probability measure projected from @xmath6 , and the risk on @xmath124 is not defined .    our idea to overcome the difficulty is to introduce an intermediate function @xmath125 . \n it may not minimize a risk ( which is not even defined ) . \n however , it approximates the component function @xmath113 well . \n when we add up such functions @xmath126 , we get a good approximation of the target function @xmath121 , and thereby a good estimate of the approximation error . \n this is the first novelty of the paper . \n [ approxerrorthm ] under assumption [ assumption1 ] , we have @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the constant given by @xmath129      the second condition for our learning rates is about the capacity of the hypothesis space measured by @xmath130-empirical covering numbers .    let @xmath131 be a set of functions on @xmath21 and @xmath132 for every @xmath133 the * covering number of @xmath131 * with respect to the empirical metric @xmath134 , given by @xmath135 is defined as @xmath136 and the * @xmath130-empirical covering number * of @xmath137 is defined as @xmath138    [ assumption2 ] we assume @xmath139 and that for some @xmath140 , @xmath141 and every @xmath142 , the @xmath130-empirical covering number of the unit ball of @xmath43 satisfies @xmath143    the second novelty of this paper is to observe that the additive nature of the hypothesis space yields the following nice bound with a dimension - independent power exponent for the covering numbers of the balls of the hypothesis space @xmath0 , to be proved in section [ samplesection ] . \n [ capacitythm ] under assumption [ assumption2 ] , for any @xmath144 and @xmath145 , we have @xmath146    the bound for the covering numbers stated in theorem [ capacitythm ] is special : the power @xmath147 is independent of the number @xmath148 of the components in the additive model . \n it is well - known @xcite in the literature of function spaces that the covering numbers of balls of the sobolev space @xmath149 on the cube @xmath150^s$ ] of the euclidean space @xmath151 with regularity index @xmath152 has the following asymptotic behavior with @xmath153 : @xmath154 here the power @xmath155 depends linearly on the dimension @xmath148 . \n similar dimension - dependent bounds for the covering numbers of the rkhss associated with gaussian rbf - kernels can be found in @xcite . \n the special bound in theorem [ capacitythm ] demonstrates an advantage of the additive model in terms of capacity of the additive hypothesis space . \n the third condition for our learning rates is about the noise level in the measure @xmath6 with respect to the hypothesis space . before stating the general condition \n , we consider a special case for quantile regression , to illustrate our general results . \n let @xmath156 be a quantile parameter . \n the quantile regression function @xmath157 is defined by its value @xmath158 to be a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath160 , i.e. , a value @xmath161 satisfying @xmath162 the regularization scheme for quantile regression considered here takes the form ( [ algor ] ) with the loss function @xmath12 given by the pinball loss as @xmath163    a noise condition on @xmath6 for quantile regression is defined in @xcite as follows . to this end , let @xmath164 be a probability measure on @xmath165 and @xmath166 . then a real number @xmath167 is called @xmath159-quantile of @xmath164 , if and only if @xmath167 belongs to the set @xmath168\\bigr ) \\ge \n \\tau     \\mbox{~~and~~ } q\\bigl([t , \\infty)\\bigr ) \\ge 1-\\tau\\bigr\\}\\,.\\ ] ] it is well - known that @xmath169 is a compact interval . \n [ noisecond ] let @xmath166 .    1 . \n a probability measure @xmath164 on @xmath165 is said to have a * @xmath159-quantile of type @xmath170 * , if there exist a @xmath159-quantile @xmath171 and a constant @xmath172 such that , for all @xmath173 $ ] , we have @xmath174 2 . \n let @xmath175 $ ] . \n we say that a probability measure @xmath20 on @xmath176 has a * @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 * if the conditional probability measure @xmath178 has @xmath179-almost surely a @xmath159-quantile of type @xmath170 and the function @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the constant defined in part ( 1 ) , satisfies @xmath182 . \n one can show that a distribution @xmath164 having a @xmath159-quantile of type @xmath170 has a unique @xmath159-quantile @xmath183 . \n moreover , if @xmath164 has a lebesgue density @xmath184 then @xmath164 has a @xmath159-quantile of type @xmath170 if @xmath184 is bounded away from zero on @xmath185 $ ] since we can use @xmath186\\}$ ] in ( [ tauquantileoftype2formula ] ) . \n this assumption is general enough to cover many distributions used in parametric statistics such as gaussian , student s @xmath187 , and logistic distributions ( with @xmath188 ) , gamma and log - normal distributions ( with @xmath189 ) , and uniform and beta distributions ( with @xmath190 $ ] ) . \n the following theorem , to be proved in section [ proofsection ] , gives a learning rate for the regularization scheme ( [ algor ] ) in the special case of quantile regression . \n [ quantilethm ] suppose that @xmath191 almost surely for some constant @xmath192 , and that each kernel @xmath41 is @xmath193 with @xmath194 for some @xmath195 . \n if assumption [ assumption1 ] holds with @xmath112 and @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 for some @xmath196 $ ] , then by taking @xmath197 , for any @xmath198 and @xmath199 , with confidence at least @xmath200 we have @xmath201 where @xmath202 is a constant independent of @xmath203 and @xmath204 and @xmath205    please note that the exponent @xmath206 given by ( [ quantilerates2 ] ) for the learning rate in ( [ quantilerates ] ) is independent of the quantile level @xmath159 , of the number @xmath148 of additive components in @xmath207 , and of the dimensions @xmath208 and @xmath209 further note that @xmath210 , if @xmath211 , and @xmath212 if @xmath213 . because @xmath214 can be arbitrarily close to @xmath215 , the learning rate , which is independent of the dimension @xmath216 and given by theorem [ quantilethm ] , is close to @xmath217 for large values of @xmath177 and is close to @xmath218 or better , if @xmath211 .      to state our general learning rates \n , we need an assumption on a _ variance - expectation bound _ which is similar to definition [ noisecond ] in the special case of quantile regression . \n [ assumption3 ] we assume that there exist an exponent @xmath219 $ ] and a positive constant @xmath220 such that @xmath221    assumption [ assumption3 ] always holds true for @xmath222 . if the triple @xmath223 satisfies some conditions , the exponent @xmath224 can be larger . \n for example , when @xmath12 is the pinball loss ( [ pinloss ] ) and @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath225 for some @xmath196 $ ] and @xmath226 as defined in @xcite , then @xmath227 . \n [ mainratesthm ] suppose that @xmath228 is bounded by a constant @xmath229 almost surely . under assumptions [ assumption1 ] to [ assumption3 ] , \n if we take @xmath198 and @xmath230 for some @xmath231 , then for any @xmath232 , with confidence at least @xmath200 we have @xmath233 where @xmath234 is given by @xmath235 and @xmath202 is constant independent of @xmath203 or @xmath204 ( to be given explicitly in the proof ) . \n we now add some theoretical and numerical comparisons on the goodness of our learning rates with those from the literature . as already mentioned in the introduction \n , some reasons for the popularity of additive models are flexibility , increased interpretability , and ( often ) a reduced proneness of the curse of high dimensions . \n hence it is important to check , whether the learning rate given in theorem [ mainratesthm ] under the assumption of an additive model favourably compares to ( essentially ) optimal learning rates without this assumption . in other words , \n we need to demonstrate that the main goal of this paper is achieved by theorem [ quantilethm ] and theorem [ mainratesthm ] , i.e. that an svm based on an additive kernel can provide a substantially better learning rate in high dimensions than an svm with a general kernel , say a classical gaussian rbf kernel , provided the assumption of an additive model is satisfied . \n our learning rate in theorem [ quantilethm ] is new and optimal in the literature of svm for quantile regression . \n most learning rates in the literature of svm for quantile regression are given for projected output functions @xmath236 , while it is well known that projections improve learning rates @xcite . here the projection operator @xmath237 is defined for any measurable function @xmath10 by @xmath238 sometimes this is called clipping . \n such results are given in @xcite . \n for example , under the assumptions that @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 , the approximation error condition ( [ approxerrorb ] ) is satisfied for some @xmath239 , and that for some constants @xmath240 , the sequence of eigenvalues @xmath241 of the integral operator @xmath117 satisfies @xmath242 for every @xmath243 , it was shown in @xcite that with confidence at least @xmath200 , @xmath244 where @xmath245 here the parameter @xmath246 measures the capacity of the rkhs @xmath247 and it plays a similar role as half of the parameter @xmath147 in assumption 2 . for a @xmath193 kernel and @xmath112 \n , one can choose @xmath246 and @xmath147 to be arbitrarily small and the above power index @xmath248 can be taken as @xmath249 . \n the learning rate in theorem [ quantilethm ] may be improved by relaxing assumption 1 to a sobolev smoothness condition for @xmath121 and a regularity condition for the marginal distribution @xmath250 . \n for example , one may use a gaussian kernel @xmath251 depending on the sample size @xmath203 and @xcite achieve the approximation error condition ( [ approxerrorb ] ) for some @xmath252 . \n this is done for quantile regression in @xcite . \n since we are mainly interested in additive models , we shall not discuss such an extension . \n [ gaussmore ] let @xmath48 , @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 ^ 2.$ ] let @xmath51 and the additive kernel @xmath72 be given by ( [ gaussaddform ] ) with @xmath253 in example [ gaussadd ] as @xmath52.\\ ] ] if the function @xmath121 is given by ( [ gaussfcn ] ) , @xmath191 almost surely for some constant @xmath192 , and @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 for some @xmath196 $ ] , then by taking @xmath197 , for any @xmath145 and @xmath199 , ( [ quantilerates ] ) holds with confidence at least @xmath200 .    it is unknown whether the above learning rate can be derived by existing approaches in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) even after projection . \n note that the kernel in the above example is independent of the sample size . \n it would be interesting to see whether there exists some @xmath99 such that the function @xmath57 defined by ( [ gaussfcn ] ) lies in the range of the operator @xmath254 . \n the existence of such a positive index would lead to the approximation error condition ( [ approxerrorb ] ) , see @xcite .    let us now add some numerical comparisons on the goodness of our learning rates given by theorem [ mainratesthm ] with those given by @xcite . \n their corollary 4.12 gives ( essentially ) minmax optimal learning rates for ( clipped ) svms in the context of nonparametric quantile regression using one gaussian rbf kernel on the whole input space under appropriate smoothness assumptions of the target function . \n let us consider the case that the distribution @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 , where @xmath255 , and assume that both corollary 4.12 in @xcite and our theorem [ mainratesthm ] are applicable . \n i.e. , we assume in particular that @xmath6 is a probability measure on @xmath256 $ ] and that the marginal distribution @xmath257 has a lebesgue density @xmath258 for some @xmath259 . furthermore , suppose that the optimal decision function @xmath260 has ( to make theorem [ mainratesthm ] applicable with @xmath261 $ ] ) the additive structure @xmath207 with each @xmath104 as stated in assumption [ assumption1 ] , where @xmath262 and @xmath263 , with minimal risk @xmath86 and additionally fulfills ( to make corollary 4.12 in @xcite applicable ) @xmath264 where @xmath265 $ ] and @xmath266 denotes a besov space with smoothness parameter @xmath267 . \n the intuitive meaning of @xmath248 is , that increasing values of @xmath248 correspond to increased smoothness . \n we refer to ( * ? ? ? * and p. 44 ) for details on besov spaces . \n it is well - known that the besov space @xmath268 contains the sobolev space @xmath269 for @xmath270 , @xmath271 , and @xmath272 , and that @xmath273 . \n we mention that if all @xmath41 are suitably chosen wendland kernels , their reproducing kernel hilbert spaces @xmath43 are sobolev spaces , see ( * ? ? ? \n * thm . 10.35 , p. 160 ) . \n furthermore , we use the same sequence of regularizing parameters as in ( * ? ? ? \n 4.9 , cor . 4.12 ) , i.e. , @xmath274 where @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath277 $ ] , and @xmath278 is some user - defined positive constant independent of @xmath279 . for \n reasons of simplicity , let us fix @xmath280 . \n then ( * ? ? ? \n 4.12 ) gives learning rates for the risk of svms for @xmath159-quantile regression , if a single gaussian rbf - kernel on @xmath281 is used for @xmath159-quantile functions of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 with @xmath255 , which are of order @xmath282 hence the learning rate in theorem [ quantilethm ] is better than the one in ( * ? ? ? \n 4.12 ) in this situation , if @xmath283 provided the assumption of the additive model is valid . \n table [ table1 ] lists the values of @xmath284 from ( [ explicitratescz2 ] ) for some finite values of the dimension @xmath216 , where @xmath285 . \n all of these values of @xmath284 are positive with the exceptions if @xmath286 or @xmath287 . \n this is in contrast to the corresponding exponent in the learning rate by ( * ? ? \n * cor . 4.12 ) , because @xmath288    table [ table2 ] and figures [ figure1 ] to [ figure2 ] give additional information on the limit @xmath289 . \n of course , higher values of the exponent indicates faster rates of convergence . \n it is obvious , that an svm based on an additive

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the efficacy of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with additive kernels for enhancing learning rates in high-dimensional settings, particularly for quantile regression. It introduces an SVM approach that employs general convex and Lipschitz continuous loss functions in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), contrasting it with traditional methods that use Gaussian RBF kernels. The findings suggest that additive models can provide significantly improved learning rates over general kernels under the assumption of an additive model structure. This advantage is attributed to the unique properties of additive kernels, which help mitigate the curse of dimensionality."

kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite element , @xmath17 is the mass of the meson , and @xmath18 is the mass of the charged lepton . \n the quantity @xmath13 describes the amplitude for the @xmath19 and @xmath20-quarks within the @xmath21 to have zero separation , a condition necessary for them to annihilate into the virtual @xmath22 boson that produces the @xmath12 pair . \n the experimental determination of decay constants is one of the most important tests of calculations involving nonperturbative qcd . \n such calculations have been performed using various models  @xcite or using lattice qcd ( lqcd ) . \n the latter is now generally considered to be the most reliable way to calculate the quantity . \n knowledge of decay constants is important for describing several key processes , such as @xmath23 mixing , which depends on @xmath24 , a quantity that is also predicted by lqcd calculations . \n experimental determination  @xcite of @xmath24 with the leptonic decay of a @xmath25 meson is , however , very limited as the rate is highly suppressed due to the smallness of the magnitude of the relevant ckm matrix element @xmath26 . \n the charm mesons , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are better instruments to study the leptonic decays of heavy mesons since these decays are either less ckm suppressed or favored , _ \n i.e. _ , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are much larger than @xmath31 . \n thus , the decay constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 determined from charm meson decays can be used to test and validate the necessary lqcd calculations applicable to the @xmath34-meson sector .    among \n the leptonic decays in the charm - quark sector , @xmath35 decays are more accessible since they are ckm favored . \n furthermore , the large mass of the @xmath11 lepton removes the helicity suppression that is present in the decays to lighter leptons . \n the existence of multiple neutrinos in the final state , however , makes measurement of this decay challenging . \n physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) might also affect leptonic decays of charmed mesons . \n depending on the non - sm features , the ratio of @xmath36 could be affected  @xcite , as could the ratio  @xcite @xmath37 . \n any of the individual widths might be increased or decreased . \n there is an indication of a discrepancy between the experimental determinations  @xcite of @xmath33 and the most recent precision lqcd calculation  @xcite . \n this disagreement is particularly puzzling since the cleo - c determination  @xcite of @xmath32 agrees well with the lqcd calculation  @xcite of that quantity . some  @xcite conjecture that this discrepancy may be explained by a charged higgs boson or a leptoquark .    in this article \n , we report an improved measurement of the absolute branching fraction of the leptonic decay @xmath0 ( charge - conjugate modes are implied ) , with @xmath1 , from which we determine the decay constant @xmath33 . \n we use a data sample of @xmath38 events provided by the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) and collected by the cleo - c detector at the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath39 mev , near @xmath3 peak production  @xcite . \n the data sample consists of an integrated luminosity of @xmath40 @xmath41 containing @xmath42 @xmath3 pairs . \n we have previously reported  @xcite measurements of @xmath43 and @xmath0 with a subsample of these data . a companion article  @xcite reports measurements of @xmath33 from @xmath43 and @xmath0 , with @xmath44 , using essentially the same data sample as the one used in this measurement . \n the cleo - c detector  @xcite is a general - purpose solenoidal detector with four concentric components utilized in this measurement : a small - radius six - layer stereo wire drift chamber , a 47-layer main drift chamber , a ring - imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detector , and an electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of 7800 csi(tl ) crystals . \n the two drift chambers operate in a @xmath45  t magnetic field and provide charged particle tracking in a solid angle of @xmath46% of @xmath47 . \n the chambers achieve a momentum resolution of @xmath48% at @xmath49  gev/@xmath50 . \n the main drift chamber also provides specific - ionization ( @xmath51 ) measurements that discriminate between charged pions and kaons . \n the rich detector covers approximately @xmath52% of @xmath47 and provides additional separation of pions and kaons at high momentum . \n the photon energy resolution of the calorimeter is @xmath53% at @xmath54  gev and @xmath55% at @xmath56  mev . \n electron identification is based on a likelihood variable that combines the information from the rich detector , @xmath51 , and the ratio of electromagnetic shower energy to track momentum ( @xmath57 ) . \n we use a geant - based  @xcite monte carlo ( mc ) simulation program to study efficiency of signal - event selection and background processes . \n physics events are generated by evtgen  @xcite , tuned with much improved knowledge of charm decays  @xcite , and final - state radiation ( fsr ) is modeled by the photos  @xcite program . \n the modeling of initial - state radiation ( isr ) is based on cross sections for @xmath3 production at lower energies obtained from the cleo - c energy scan  @xcite near the cm energy where we collect the sample . \n the presence of two @xmath58 mesons in a @xmath3 event allows us to define a single - tag ( st ) sample in which a @xmath58 is reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode and a further double - tagged ( dt ) subsample in which an additional @xmath59 is required as a signature of @xmath60 decay , the @xmath59 being the daughter of the @xmath60 . \n the @xmath61 reconstructed in the st sample can be either primary or secondary from @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) . \n the st yield can be expressed as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the produced number of @xmath3 pairs , @xmath66 is the branching fraction of hadronic modes used in the st sample , and @xmath67 is the st efficiency . \n the @xmath68 counts the candidates , not events , and the factor of 2 comes from the sum of @xmath28 and @xmath61 tags . \n our double - tag ( dt ) sample is formed from events with only a single charged track , identified as an @xmath69 , in addition to a st . \n the yield can be expressed as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the leptonic decay branching fraction , including the subbranching fraction of @xmath1 decay , @xmath72 is the efficiency of finding the st and the leptonic decay in the same event . from the st and dt yields we can obtain an absolute branching fraction of the leptonic decay @xmath71 , without needing to know the integrated luminosity or the produced number of @xmath3 pairs , @xmath73 where @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) is the effective signal efficiency . because of the large solid angle acceptance with high segmentation of the cleo - c detector and the low multiplicity of the events with which we are concerned , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the leptonic decay efficiency . \n hence , the ratio @xmath78 is insensitive to most systematic effects associated with the st , and the signal branching fraction @xmath71 obtained using this procedure is nearly independent of the efficiency of the tagging mode .      to minimize systematic uncertainties , we tag using three two - body hadronic decay modes with only charged particles in the final state . \n the three st modes and @xmath79 are shorthand labels for @xmath80 events within mass windows ( described below ) of the @xmath81 peak in @xmath82 and the @xmath83 peak in @xmath84 , respectively . \n no attempt is made to separate these resonance components in the @xmath85 dalitz plot . ] \n are @xmath86 , @xmath79 , and @xmath87 . \n using these tag modes also helps to reduce the tag bias which would be caused by the correlation between the tag side and the signal side reconstruction if tag modes with high multiplicity and large background were used . \n the effect of the tag bias @xmath88 can be expressed in terms of the signal efficiency @xmath74 defined by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the st efficiency when the recoiling system is the signal leptonic decay with single @xmath59 in the other side of the tag . \n as the general st efficiency @xmath67 , when the recoiling system is any possible @xmath91 decays , will be lower than the @xmath90 , sizable tag bias could be introduced if the multiplicity of the tag mode were high , or the tag mode were to include neutral particles in the final state . as shown in sec . \n [ sec : results ] , this effect is negligible in our chosen clean tag modes . \n the @xmath92 decay is reconstructed by combining oppositely charged tracks that originate from a common vertex and that have an invariant mass within @xmath93 mev of the nominal mass  @xcite . \n we require the resonance decay to satisfy the following mass windows around the nominal masses  @xcite : @xmath94 ( @xmath95 mev ) and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 mev ) . \n we require the momenta of charged particles to be @xmath56 mev or greater to suppress the slow pion background from @xmath98 decays ( through @xmath99 ) . \n we identify a st by using the invariant mass of the tag @xmath100 and recoil mass against the tag @xmath101 . \n the recoil mass is defined as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the net four - momentum of the @xmath4 beam , taking the finite beam crossing angle into account ; @xmath104 is the four - momentum of the tag , with @xmath105 computed from @xmath106 and the nominal mass  @xcite of the @xmath91 meson . \n we require the recoil mass to be within @xmath107 mev of the @xmath108 mass  @xcite . \n this loose window allows both primary and secondary @xmath91 tags to be selected .        to estimate the backgrounds in our st and dt yields from the wrong tag combinations ( incorrect combinations that , by chance , lie within the @xmath109 signal region ) , we use the tag invariant mass sidebands . \n we define the signal region as @xmath110 mev @xmath111 mev , and the sideband regions as @xmath112 mev @xmath113 mev or @xmath114 mev @xmath115 mev , where @xmath116 is the difference between the tag mass and the nominal mass . \n we fit the st @xmath109 distributions to the sum of double - gaussian signal function plus second - degree chebyshev polynomial background function to get the tag mass sideband scaling factor . \n the invariant mass distributions of tag candidates for each tag mode are shown in fig . \n [ fig : dm ] and the st yield and @xmath109 sideband scaling factor are summarized in table  [ table : data - single ] . \n we find @xmath117 summed over the three tag modes . \n .[table : data - single ] summary of single - tag ( st ) yields , where @xmath118 is the yield in the st mass signal region , @xmath119 is the yield in the sideband region , @xmath120 is the sideband scaling factor , and @xmath68 is the scaled sideband - subtracted yield . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we considered six semileptonic decays , @xmath121 @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , as the major sources of background in the @xmath128 signal region . \n the second dominates the nonpeaking background , and the fourth ( with @xmath129 ) dominates the peaking background . \n uncertainty in the signal yield due to nonpeaking background ( @xmath130 ) is assessed by varying the semileptonic decay branching fractions by the precision with which they are known  @xcite . \n imperfect knowledge of @xmath131 gives rise to a systematic uncertainty in our estimate of the amount of peaking background in the signal region , which has an effect on our branching fraction measurement of @xmath132 . \n we study differences in efficiency , data vs mc events , due to the extra energy requirement , extra track veto , and @xmath133 requirement , by using samples from data and mc events , in which _ both _ the @xmath134 and @xmath2 satisfy our tag requirements , i.e. , `` double - tag '' events . \n we then apply each of the above - mentioned requirements and compare loss in efficiency of data vs mc events . in this way \n we obtain a correction of @xmath135 for the extra energy requirement and systematic uncertainties on each of the three requirements of @xmath136 ( all equal , by chance ) . \n the non-@xmath69 background in the signal @xmath69 candidate sample is negligible ( @xmath137 ) due to the low probability ( @xmath138 per track ) that hadrons ( @xmath139 or @xmath140 ) are misidentified as @xmath69  @xcite . \n uncertainty in these backgrounds produces a @xmath141 uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath142 . \n the secondary @xmath69 backgrounds from charge symmetric processes , such as @xmath143 dalitz decay ( @xmath144 ) and @xmath145 conversion ( @xmath146 ) , are assessed by measuring the wrong - sign signal electron in events with @xmath147 . the uncertainty in the measurement from this source \n is estimated to be @xmath148 . \n other possible sources of systematic uncertainty include @xmath68 ( @xmath137 ) , tag bias ( @xmath149 ) , tracking efficiency ( @xmath148 ) , @xmath59 identification efficiency ( @xmath150 ) , and fsr ( @xmath150 ) . combining all contributions in quadrature , \n the total systematic uncertainty in the branching fraction measurement is estimated to be @xmath151 . \n in summary , using the sample of @xmath152 tagged @xmath28 decays with the cleo - c detector we obtain the absolute branching fraction of the leptonic decay @xmath153 through @xmath154 @xmath155 where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic . \n this result supersedes our previous measurement  @xcite of the same branching fraction , which used a subsample of data used in this work . \n the decay constant @xmath33 can be computed using eq . \n ( [ eq : f ] ) with known values  @xcite @xmath156 gev@xmath157 , @xmath158 mev , @xmath159 mev , and @xmath160 s. we assume @xmath161 and use the value @xmath162 given in ref . \n we obtain @xmath163    combining with our other determination  @xcite of @xmath164 mev with @xmath43 and @xmath0 ( @xmath165 ) decays , we obtain @xmath166 this result is derived from absolute branching fractions only and is the most precise determination of the @xmath91 leptonic decay constant to date .    our combined result is larger than the recent lqcd calculation @xmath167 mev  @xcite by @xmath168 standard deviations . \n the difference between data and lqcd for @xmath33 could be due to physics beyond the sm  @xcite , unlikely statistical fluctuations in the experimental measurements or the lqcd calculation , or systematic uncertainties that are not understood in the lqcd calculation or the experimental measurements .    combining with our other determination  @xcite of @xmath169 , via @xmath44 \n , we obtain @xmath170 using this with our measurement  @xcite of @xmath171 , we obtain the branching fraction ratio @xmath172 this is consistent with @xmath173 , the value predicted by the sm with lepton universality , as given in eq . \n ( [ eq : f ] ) with known masses  @xcite . \n we gratefully acknowledge the effort of the cesr staff in providing us with excellent luminosity and running conditions . \n d.  cronin - hennessy and a.  ryd thank the a.p .  sloan foundation . \n this work was supported by the national science foundation , the u.s . \n department of energy , the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada , and the u.k . \n science and technology facilities council .        c.  amsler \n _ et al . _ \n ( particle data group ) , phys . \n b * 667 * , 1 ( 2008 ) . \n k.  ikado _ et al . _ \n ( belle collaboration ) , phys . \n lett .   * 97 * , 251802 ( 2006 ) . \n b.  aubert _ et al . \n _ ( babar collaboration ) , phys .  rev . \n d * 77 * , 011107 ( 2008 ) . \n a.  g.  akeroyd and c.  h.  chen , phys . \n d * 75 * , 075004 ( 2007 ) ;

        "abstract": "This article explores the leptonic decays of charged pseudoscalar mesons, a process crucial for probing the strong interactions within mesons via a clean experimental method. The decay rate measurements directly inform the meson decay constant, which in turn facilitates the testing of nonperturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculations, especially those using lattice QCD (LQCD). Despite the experimental challenges posed by helicity suppression and background noises, recent advancements have improved the precision of these measurements. The paper details an improved measurement method using the CLEO-C detector and discusses the implications of the results for understanding fundamental particle interactions and potential deviations from the Standard Model predictions."

        "article": "the transport properties of nonlinear non - equilibrium dynamical systems are far from well - understood@xcite . \n consider in particular so - called ratchet systems which are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experience directed transport@xcite . \n the origins of the interest in this lie in considerations about extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations as seems to happen in biological systems@xcite . \n recently attention has been focused on the behavior of deterministic chaotic ratchets@xcite as well as hamiltonian ratchets@xcite . \n chaotic systems are defined as those which are sensitively dependent on initial conditions . whether chaotic or not , the behavior of nonlinear systems  including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior  is in general sensitively dependent on the parameters of the system . \n that is , the phase - space structure is usually relatively complicated , consisting of stability islands embedded in chaotic seas , for examples , or of simultaneously co - existing attractors . \n this can change significantly as parameters change . \n for example , stability islands can merge into each other , or break apart , and the chaotic sea itself may get pinched off or otherwise changed , or attractors can change symmetry or bifurcate . \n this means that the transport properties can change dramatically as well . \n a few years ago , mateos@xcite considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle . \n he looked at an ensemble of particles , specifically the velocity for the particles , averaged over time and the entire ensemble . \n he showed that this quantity , which is an intuitively reasonable definition of ` the current ' , could be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude @xmath0 of the periodic forcing for the system . at the same time , there exist ranges in @xmath0 where the trajectory of an individual particle displays chaotic dynamics . \n mateos conjectured a connection between these two phenomena , specifically that the reversal of current direction was correlated with a bifurcation from chaotic to periodic behavior in the trajectory dynamics . \n even though it is unlikely that such a result would be universally valid across all chaotic deterministic ratchets , it would still be extremely useful to have general heuristic rules such as this . \n these organizing principles would allow some handle on characterizing the many different kinds of behavior that are possible in such systems . \n a later investigation@xcite of the mateos conjecture by barbi and salerno , however , argued that it was not a valid rule even in the specific system considered by mateos . \n they presented results showing that it was possible to have current reversals in the absence of bifurcations from periodic to chaotic behavior . \n they proposed an alternative origin for the current reversal , suggesting it was related to the different stability properties of the rotating periodic orbits of the system . \n these latter results seem fundamentally sensible . however , this paper based its arguments about currents on the behavior of a _ single _ particle as opposed to an ensemble . \n this implicitly assumes that the dynamics of the system are ergodic . \n this is not true in general for chaotic systems of the type being considered . in particular , there can be extreme dependence of the result on the statistics of the ensemble being considered . \n this has been pointed out in earlier studies  @xcite which laid out a detailed methodology for understanding transport properties in such a mixed regular and chaotic system . depending on specific parameter value , the particular system under consideration has multiple coexisting periodic or chaotic attractors or a mixture of both . \n it is hence appropriate to understand how a probability ensemble might behave in such a system . \n the details of the dependence on the ensemble are particularly relevant to the issue of the possible experimental validation of these results , since experiments are always conducted , by virtue of finite - precision , over finite time and finite ensembles . \n it is therefore interesting to probe the results of barbi and salerno with regard to the details of the ensemble used , and more formally , to see how ergodicity alters our considerations about the current , as we do in this paper . \n we report here on studies on the properties of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet , specifically the same system as considered by mateos@xcite and barbi and salerno@xcite . \n we consider the impact of different kinds of ensembles of particles on the current and show that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble . \n we also show that it is important to discard transients in quantifying the current . \n this is one of the central messages of this paper : broad heuristics are rare in chaotic systems , and hence it is critical to understand the ensemble - dependence in any study of the transport properties of chaotic ratchets . \n having established this , we then proceed to discuss the connection between the bifurcation diagram for individual particles and the behavior of the current . \n we find that while we disagree with many of the details of barbi and salerno s results , the broader conclusion still holds . \n that is , it is indeed possible to have current reversals in the absence of bifurcations from chaos to periodic behavior as well as bifurcations without any accompanying current reversals . \n the result of our investigation is therefore that the transport properties of a chaotic ratchet are not as simple as the initial conjecture . \n however , we do find evidence for a generalized version of mateos s conjecture . \n that is , in general , bifurcations for trajectory dynamics as a function of system parameter seem to be associated with abrupt changes in the current . \n depending on the specific value of the current , these abrupt changes may lead the net current to reverse direction , but not necessarily so . \n we start below with a preparatory discussion necessary to understand the details of the connection between bifurcations and current reversal , where we discuss the potential and phase - space for single trajectories for this system , where we also define a bifurcation diagram for this system . in the next section , \n we discuss the subtleties of establishing a connection between the behavior of individual trajectories and of ensembles . \n after this , we are able to compare details of specific trajectory bifurcation curves with current curves , and thus justify our broader statements above , after which we conclude . \n the goal of these studies is to understand the behavior of general chaotic ratchets . \n the approach taken here is that to discover heuristic rules we must consider specific systems in great detail before generalizing . \n we choose the same @xmath1-dimensional ratchet considered previously by mateos@xcite , as well as barbi and salerno@xcite . \n we consider an ensemble of particles moving in an asymmetric periodic potential , driven by a periodic time - dependent external force , where the force has a zero time - average . \n there is no noise in the system , so it is completely deterministic , although there is damping . \n the equations of motion for an individual trajectory for such a system are given in dimensionless variables by @xmath2 where the periodic asymmetric potential can be written in the form @xmath3 + \\frac{1}{4 } \\sin [ 4\\pi ( x -x_0 ) ] \\bigg ] .\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath4 have been introduced for convenience such that one potential minimum exists at the origin with @xmath5 and the term @xmath6 . \n ( a ) classical phase space for the unperturbed system . for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , \n two chaotic attractors emerge with @xmath9 ( b ) @xmath10 ( c ) and a period four attractor consisting of the four centers of the circles with @xmath11.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    the phase - space of the undamped undriven ratchet  the system corresponding to the unperturbed potential @xmath12  looks like a series of asymmetric pendula . \n that is , individual trajectories have one of following possible time - asymptotic behaviors : ( i ) inside the potential wells , trajectories and all their properties oscillate , leading to zero net transport . outside the wells , the trajectories either ( ii ) librate to the right or ( iii ) to the left , with corresponding net transport depending upon initial conditions . \n there are also ( iv ) trajectories on the separatrices between the oscillating and librating orbits , moving between unstable fixed points in infinite time , as well as the unstable and stable fixed points themselves , all of which constitute a set of negligible measure .    when damping is introduced via the @xmath13-dependent term in eq . \n [ eq : dyn ] , it makes the stable fixed points the only attractors for the system . \n when the driving is turned on , the phase - space becomes chaotic with the usual phenomena of intertwining separatrices and resulting homoclinic tangles . \n the dynamics of individual trajectories in such a system are now very complicated in general and depend sensitively on the choice of parameters and initial conditions . \n we show snapshots of the development of this kind of chaos in the set of poincar sections fig . \n ( [ figure1]b , c ) together with a period - four orbit represented by the center of the circles .    a broad characterization of the dynamics of the problem as a function of a parameter ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) emerges in a bifurcation diagram \n . this can be constructed in several different and essentially equivalent ways . \n the relatively standard form that we use proceeds as follows : first choose the bifurcation parameter ( let us say @xmath0 ) and correspondingly choose fixed values of @xmath16 , and start with a given value for @xmath17 . \n now iterate an initial condition , recording the value of the particle s position @xmath18 at times @xmath19 from its integrated trajectory ( sometimes we record @xmath20 . \n this is done stroboscopically at discrete times @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is an integer @xmath24 with @xmath25 the maximum number of observations made . of these , discard observations at times less than some cut - off time @xmath26 and plot the remaining points against @xmath27 . \n it must be noted that discarding transient behavior is critical to get results which are independent of initial condition , and we shall emphasize this further below in the context of the net transport or current . \n if the system has a fixed - point attractor then all of the data lie at one particular location @xmath28 . a periodic orbit with period @xmath29 ( that is , with period commensurate with the driving ) shows up with @xmath30 points occupying only @xmath31 different locations of @xmath32 for @xmath27 . \n all other orbits , including periodic orbits of incommensurate period result in a simply - connected or multiply - connected dense set of points . for the next value @xmath33 , the last computed value of @xmath34 at @xmath35 are used as initial conditions , and previously , results are stored after cutoff and so on until @xmath36 . \n that is , the bifurcation diagram is generated by sweeping the relevant parameter , in this case @xmath0 , from @xmath27 through some maximum value @xmath37 . \n this procedure is intended to catch all coexisting attractors of the system with the specified parameter range . \n note that several initial conditions are effectively used troughout the process , and a bifurcation diagram is not the behavior of a single trajectory . \n we have made several plots , as a test , with different initial conditions and the diagrams obtained are identical . \n we show several examples of this kind of bifurcation diagram below , where they are being compared with the corresponding behavior of the current . \n having broadly understood the wide range of behavior for individual trajectories in this system , we now turn in the next section to a discussion of the non - equilibrium properties of a statistical ensemble of these trajectories , specifically the current for an ensemble . \n the current @xmath38 for an ensemble in the system is defined in an intuitive manner by mateos@xcite as the time - average of the average velocity over an ensemble of initial conditions . \n that is , an average over several initial conditions is performed at a given observation time @xmath39 to yield the average velocity over the particles @xmath40 this average velocity is then further time - averaged ; given the discrete time @xmath39 for observation this leads to a second sum @xmath41 where @xmath25 is the number of time - observations made .    for this to be a relevant quantity to compare with bifurcation diagrams , @xmath38 should be independent of the quantities @xmath42 but still strongly dependent on @xmath43 . \n a further parameter dependence that is being suppressed in the definition above is the shape and location of the ensemble being used . \n that is , the transport properties of an ensemble in a chaotic system depend in general on the part of the phase - space being sampled . \n it is therefore important to consider many different initial conditions to generate a current . the first straightforward result we show in fig . \n ( [ figure2 ] ) is that in the case of chaotic trajectories , a single trajectory easily displays behavior very different from that of many trajectories . \n however , it turns out that in the regular regime , it is possible to use a single trajectory to get essentially the same result as obtained from many trajectories .    further consider the bifurcation diagram in fig . \n ( [ figure3 ] ) where we superimpose the different curves resulting from varying the number of points in the initial ensemble . \n first , the curve is significantly smoother as a function of @xmath0 for larger @xmath44 . even more relevant is the fact that the single trajectory data ( @xmath45 ) may show current reversals that do not exist in the large @xmath44 data . \n current @xmath38 versus the number of trajectories @xmath44 for @xmath7 ; dashed lines correspond to a regular motion with @xmath46 while solid lines correspond to a chaotic motion with @xmath47 . \n note that a single trajectory is sufficient for a regular motion while the convergence in the chaotic case is only obtained if the @xmath44 exceeds a certain threshold , @xmath48.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]     current @xmath38 versus @xmath0 for different set of trajectories @xmath44 ; @xmath45 ( circles ) , @xmath49 ( square ) and @xmath50 ( dashed lines ) . note that a single trajectory suffices in the regular regime where all the curves match . in the chaotic regime \n , as @xmath44 increases , the curves converge towards the dashed one.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    also , note that single - trajectory current values are typically significantly greater than ensemble averages . \n this arises from the fact that an arbitrarily chosen ensemble has particles with idiosyncratic behaviors which often average out . as our result , with these ensembles we see typical @xmath51 for example , while barbi and salerno report currents about @xmath52 times greater . \n however , it is not true that only a few trajectories dominate the dynamics completely , else there would not be a saturation of the current as a function of @xmath44 . \n all this is clear in fig . \n ( [ figure3 ] ) . \n we note that the * net * drift of an ensemble can be a lot closer to @xmath53 than the behavior of an individual trajectory \n .    it should also be clear that there is a dependence of the current on the location of the initial ensemble , this being particularly true for small @xmath44 , of course . \n the location is defined by its centroid @xmath54 . for @xmath45 , it is trivially true that the initial location matters to the asymptotic value of the time - averaged velocity , given that this is a non - ergodic and chaotic system . \n further , considering a gaussian ensemble , say , the width of the ensemble also affects the details of the current , and can show , for instance , illusory current reversal , as seen in figs . \n ( [ current - bifur1],[current - bifur2 ] ) for example . \n notice also that in fig . \n ( [ current - bifur1 ] ) , at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the deviations between the different ensembles is particularly pronounced . \n these points are close to bifurcation points where some sort of symmetry breaking is clearly occuring , which underlines our emphasis on the relevance of specifying ensemble characteristics in the neighborhood of unstable behavior . \n however , why these specific bifurcations should stand out among all the bifurcations in the parameter range shown is not entirely clear .    to understand how to incorporate this knowledge into calculations of the current , \n therefore , consider the fact that if we look at the classical phase space for the hamiltonian or underdamped @xmath57 motion , we see the typical structure of stable islands embedded in a chaotic sea which have quite complicated behavior@xcite . in such a situation , the dynamics always depends on the location of the initial conditions . \n however , we are not in the hamiltonian situation when the damping is turned on  in this case , the phase - space consists in general of attractors . \n that is , if transient behavior is discarded , the current is less likely to depend significantly on the location of the initial conditions or on the spread of the initial conditions .    in particular , in the chaotic regime of a non - hamiltonian system , the initial ensemble needs to be chosen larger than a certain threshold to ensure convergence . \n however , in the regular regime , it is not important to take a large ensemble and a single trajectory can suffice , as long as we take care to discard the transients . \n that is to say , in the computation of currents , the definition of the current needs to be modified to : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is some empirically obtained cut - off such that we get a converged current ( for instance , in our calculations , we obtained converged results with @xmath60 ) . when this modified form is used , the convergence ( ensemble - independence ) is more rapid as a function of @xmath61 and the width of the intial conditions . \n armed with this background , we are now finally in a position to compare bifurcation diagrams with the current , as we do in the next section . \n our results are presented in the set of figures fig . \n ( [ figure5 ] )  fig . \n ( [ rev - nobifur ] ) , in each of which we plot both the ensemble current and the bifurcation diagram as a function of the parameter @xmath0 . \n the main point of these numerical results can be distilled into a series of heuristic statements which we state below ; these are labelled with roman numerals .     for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we plot current ( upper ) with @xmath62 and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @xmath0 . \n note that there is a * single * current reversal while there are many bifurcations visible in the same parameter range.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    consider fig . \n ( [ figure5 ] ) , which shows the parameter range @xmath63 chosen relatively arbitrarily . in this figure , we see several period - doubling bifurcations leading to order - chaos transitions , such as for example in the approximate ranges @xmath64 . however , there is only one instance of current - reversal , at @xmath65 . \n note , however , that the current is not without structure  it changes fairly dramatically as a function of parameter . \n this point is made even more clearly in fig . \n ( [ figure6 ] ) where the current remains consistently below @xmath53 , and hence there are in fact , no current reversals at all . \n note again , however , that the current has considerable structure , even while remaining negative \n .     for @xmath66 and @xmath8 , plotted are current ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @xmath0 with @xmath62 . \n notice the current stays consistently below @xmath53.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]     current and bifurcations versus @xmath0 . in ( a ) and ( b ) \n we show ensemble dependence , specifically in ( a ) the black curve is for an ensemble of trajectories starting centered at the stable fixed point @xmath67 with a root - mean - square gaussian width of @xmath68 , and the brown curve for trajectories starting from the unstable fixed point @xmath69 and of width @xmath68 . in ( b ) , all ensembles are centered at the stable fixed point , the black line for an ensemble of width @xmath68 , brown a width of @xmath70 and maroon with width @xmath71 . \n ( c ) is the comparison of the current @xmath38 without transients ( black ) and with transients ( brown ) along with the single - trajectory results in blue ( after barbi and salerno ) . \n the initial conditions for the ensembles are centered at @xmath67 with a mean root square gaussian of width @xmath68 . \n ( d ) is the corresponding bifurcation diagram.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    it is possible to find several examples of this at different parameters , leading to the negative conclusion , therefore , that * ( i ) not all bifurcations lead to current reversal*. however , we are searching for positive correlations , and at this point we have not precluded the more restricted statement that all current reversals are associated with bifurcations , which is in fact mateos conjecture . \n we therefore now move onto comparing our results against the specific details of barbi and salerno s treatment of this conjecture . in particular , we look at their figs . \n ( 2,3a,3b ) , where they scan the parameter region @xmath72 . \n the distinction between their results and ours is that we are using _ \n ensembles _ of particles , and are investigating the convergence of these results as a function of number of particles @xmath44 , the width of the ensemble in phase - space , as well as transience parameters @xmath73 .    our data with larger @xmath44 yields different results in general , as we show in the recomputed versions of these figures , presented here in figs . \n ( [ current - bifur1],[current - bifur2 ] ) . \n specifically , ( a ) the single - trajectory results are , not surprisingly , cleaner and can be more easily interpreted as part of transitions in the behavior of the stability properties of the periodic orbits . \n the ensemble results on the other hand , even when converged , show statistical roughness . \n ( b ) the ensemble results are consistent with barbi and salerno in general , although disagreeing in several details . \n for instance , ( c ) the bifurcation at @xmath74 has a much gentler impact on the ensemble current , which has been growing for a while , while the single - trajectory result changes abruptly . note , ( d ) the very interesting fact that the single - trajectory current completely misses the bifurcation - associated spike at @xmath75 . \n further , ( e ) the barbi and salerno discussion of the behavior of the current in the range @xmath76 is seen to be flawed \n our results are consistent with theirs , however , the current changes are seen to be consistent with bifurcations despite their statements to the contrary . on the other hand ( f ) , the ensemble current shows a case [ in fig . \n ( [ current - bifur2 ] ) , at @xmath77 of current reversal that does not seem to be associated with bifurcations . \n in this spike , the current abruptly drops below @xmath53 and then rises above it again . \n the single trajectory current completely ignores this particular effect , as can be seen . \n the bifurcation diagram indicates that in this case the important transitions happen either before or after the spike . \n all of this adds up to two statements : the first is a reiteration of the fact that there is significant information in the ensemble current that can not be obtained from the single - trajectory current . \n the second is that the heuristic that arises from this is again a negative conclusion , that * ( ii ) not all current reversals are associated with bifurcations . \n * where does this leave us in the search for ` positive ' results , that is , useful heuristics ? \n one possible way of retaining the mateos conjecture is to weaken it , i.e. make it into the statement that * ( iii ) _ most _ current reversals are associated with bifurcations . *     same as fig . \n ( [ current - bifur1 ] ) except for the range of @xmath0 considered.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]     for @xmath78 and @xmath8 , plotted are current ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @xmath0 with @xmath62 . \n note in particular in this figure that eyeball tests can be misleading . \n we see reversals without bifurcations in ( a ) whereas the zoomed version ( c ) shows that there are windows of periodic and chaotic regimes . \n this is further evidence that jumps in the current correspond in general to bifurcation.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]     for @xmath7 and @xmath79 , current ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @xmath0.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    however , a * different * rule of thumb , previously not proposed , emerges from our studies . \n this generalizes mateos conjecture to say that * ( iv ) bifurcations correspond to sudden current changes ( spikes or jumps)*. note that this means these changes in current are not necessarily reversals of direction . \n if this current jump or spike goes through zero , this coincides with a current reversal , making the mateos conjecture a special case . \n the physical basis of this argument is the fact that ensembles of particles in chaotic systems _ can _ have net directed transport but the details of this behavior depends relatively sensitively on the system parameters . \n this parameter dependence is greatly exaggerated at the bifurcation point , when the dynamics of the underlying single - particle system undergoes a transition  a period - doubling transition , for example , or one from chaos to regular behavior . \n scanning the relevant figures , we see that this is a very useful rule of thumb . for example \n , it completely captures the behaviour of fig . \n ( [ figure6 ] ) which can not be understood as either an example of the mateos conjecture , or even a failure thereof . as such \n , this rule significantly enhances our ability to characterize changes in the behavior of the current as a function of parameter . \n a further example of where this modified conjecture helps us is in looking at a seeming negation of the mateos conjecture , that is , an example where we seem to see current - reversal without bifurcation , visible in fig . \n ( [ hidden - bifur ] ) . \n the current - reversals in that scan of parameter space seem to happen inside the chaotic regime and seemingly independent of bifurcation . however , this turns out to be a ` hidden ' bifurcation  when we zoom in on the chaotic regime , we see hidden periodic windows . \n this is therefore consistent with our statement that sudden current changes are associated with bifurcations . \n each of the transitions from periodic behavior to chaos and back provides opportunities for the current to spike . \n however , in not all such cases can these hidden bifurcations be found . \n we can see an example of this in fig . \n ( [ rev - nobifur ] ) . \n the current is seen to move smoothly across @xmath80 with seemingly no corresponding bifurcations , even when we do a careful zoom on the data , as in fig . \n ( [ hidden - bifur ] ) . \n however , arguably , although subjective , this change is close to the bifurcation point . \n this result , that there are situations where the heuristics simply do not seem to apply , are part of the open questions associated with this problem , of course . \n we note , however , that we have seen that these broad arguments hold when we vary other parameters as well ( figures not shown here ) .    in conclusion , \n in this paper we have taken the approach that it is useful to find general rules of thumb ( even if not universally valid ) to understand the complicated behavior of non - equilibrium nonlinear statistical mechanical systems . in the case of chaotic deterministic ratchets \n , we have shown that it is important to factor out issues of size , location , spread , and transience in computing the ` current ' due to an ensemble before we search for such rules , and that the dependence on ensemble characteristics is most critical near certain bifurcation points . \n we have then argued that the following heuristic characteristics hold : bifurcations in single - trajectory behavior often corresponds to sudden spikes or jumps in the current for an ensemble in the same system . \n current reversals are a special case of this \n . however , not all spikes or jumps correspond to a bifurcation , nor vice versa . \n the open question is clearly to figure out if the reason for when these rules are violated or are valid can be made more concrete . \n a.k . gratefully acknowledges t. barsch and kamal p. singh for stimulating discussions , the reimar lst grant and financial support from the alexander von humboldt foundation in bonn . a.k.p . \n is grateful to carleton college for the ` sit , wallin , and class of 1949 ' sabbatical fellowships , and to the mpipks for hosting him for a sabbatical visit , which led to this collaboration . \n useful discussions with j .- \n m . rost on preliminary results are also acknowledged . \n p. hnggi and bartussek , in nonlinear physics of complex systems , lecture notes in physics vol . \n 476 , edited by j. parisi , s.c . \n mueller , and w. zimmermann ( springer verlag , berlin , 1996 ) , pp.294 -

        "abstract": "The exploration of nonlinear non-equilibrium dynamical systems, particularly ratchet systems, remains a complex field of study. Ratchet systems, characterized by asymmetric periodic potentials, facilitate directed transport of particles, making them significant for understanding biological mechanisms. Recent research has delved into both deterministic chaotic and Hamiltonian ratchets, revealing the intricacies of these systems' behavior based on initial conditions and system parameters. These systems exhibit complicated phase-space structures with chaotic seas and stability islands, which evolve dramatically with parameter changes, significantly affecting transport properties. This ongoing research underlines the challenge of predicting system behavior due to its sensitivity to varying conditions."

        "article": "studies of laser beams propagating through turbulent atmospheres are important for many applications such as remote sensing , tracking , and long - distance optical communications . \n howerver , fully coherent laser beams are very sensitive to fluctuations of the atmospheric refractive index . \n the initially coherent laser beam acquires some properties of gaussian statistics in course of its propagation through the turbulence . as a result , the noise / signal ratio approaches unity for long - distance propagation . \n ( see , for example , refs.@xcite-@xcite ) . \n this unfavourable effect limits the performance of communication channels . to mitigate this negative effect \n the use of partially ( spatially ) coherent beams was proposed . \n the coherent laser beam can be transformed into a partially coherent beam by means of a phase diffuser placed near the exit aperture . \n this diffuser introduces an additional phase ( randomly varying in space and time ) to the wave front of the outgoing radiation . \n statistical characteristics of the random phase determine the initial transverse coherence length of the beam . \n it is shown in refs . \n @xcite,@xcite that a considerable decrease in the noise / signal ratio can occur under following conditions : ( i ) the ratio of the initial transverse coherence length , @xmath0 , to the beam radius , @xmath1 , should be essentially smaller than unity ; and ( ii ) the characteristic time of phase variations , @xmath2 , should be much smaller than the integration time , @xmath3 , of the detector . \n however , only limiting cases @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been considered in the literature . \n ( see , for example , refs . \n @xcite,@xcite and ref . \n @xcite , respectively ) . \n it is evident that the inequality @xmath6 can be easily satisfied by choosing a detector with very long integration time . at the same time \n , this kind of the detector can not distinguish different signals within the interval @xmath3 . \n this means that the resolution of the receiving system might become too low for the case of large @xmath3 . on the other hand \n , there is a technical restriction on phase diffusers : up to now their characteristic times , @xmath2 , are not smaller than @xmath7 . besides that , in some specific cases ( see , for example , ref . \n @xcite ) , the spectral broadening of laser radiation due to the phase diffuser ( @xmath8 ) may become unacceptably high . \n the factors mentioned above impose serious restrictions on the physical characteristics of phase diffusers which could be potentially useful for suppressing the intensity fluctuations . \n an adequate choice of diffusers may be facilitated if we know in detail the effect of finite - time phase variation , introduced by them , on the photon statistics . in this case \n , it is possible to control the performance of communication systems . in what follows , we will obtain theoretically the dependence of scintillation index on @xmath9 without any restrictions on the value of this ratio \n this is the main purpose of our paper . \n further analysis is based on the formalism developed in ref . \n @xcite and modified here to understand the case of finite - time dynamics of the phase diffuser . \n the detectors of the absorbed type do not sense the instantaneous intensity of electromagnetic waves @xmath10 . \n they sense the intensity averaged over some finite interval @xmath3 i.e. @xmath11 usually , the averaging time @xmath3 ( the integration time of the detector ) is much smaller than the characteristic time of the turbulence variation , @xmath12 , ( @xmath13 ) . \n therefore , the average value of the intensity can be obtained by further averaging of eq . \n [ one ] over many measurements corresponding various realizations of the refractive - index configurations . \n the scintillation index determining the mean - square fluctuations of the intensity is defined by @xmath14\\bigg /\\big \n < \\bar{i}\\big > ^2= \n \\frac{\\big < : \\bar i(t ) ^2:\\big>}{\\big<\\bar i \\big>^2}-1,\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath15 indicates the normal ordering of the creation and annihilation operators which determine the intensity , @xmath10 . \n ( see more details in refs . \n @xcite,@xcite ) . the brackets @xmath16 indicate quantum - mechanical and atmospheric averagings . \n the intensity @xmath17 depends not only on @xmath18 , but also on the spatial variable @xmath19 . therefore , the detected intensity is the intensity @xmath20 averaged not only over @xmath18 as in eq . \n [ one ] , but also over the detector aperture . for simplicity , we will restrict ourselves to calculations of the intensity correlations for coinciding spatial points that correspond to `` small '' detector aperture . \n this simplification is quite reasonable for a long - distance propagation path of the beam .    in the case of quasimonochromatic light \n , we can choose @xmath20 in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the creation and annihilation operators of photons with momentum @xmath24 . \n they are given in the heisenberg representation . \n @xmath25 is the volume of the system . \n it follows from eqs . \n [ two],[three ] that @xmath26 can be obtained if one knows the average @xmath27 it is a complex problem to obtain this value for arbitrary turbulence strengths and propagation distances . \n nevertheless , the following qualitative reasoning can help to do this in the case of strong turbulence . \n we have mentioned that the laser light acquires the properties of gaussian statistics in the course of its propagation through the turbulent atmosphere . as a result , in the limit of infinitely long propagation path , @xmath28 , only \n diagonal \" terms , i.e. terms with ( i ) @xmath29 or ( ii ) @xmath30 , @xmath31 contribute to the right part of eq . [ four ] . for large but still finite @xmath28 \n , there exist small ranges of @xmath32 in case ( i ) and @xmath33 , @xmath34 in case ( ii ) contributing into the sum in eq . \n the presence of the mentioned regions is due to the two possible ways of correlating of four different waves ( see ref . \n @xcite ) which enter the right hand side of eq . \n [ four ] . as explained in ref . \n @xcite , the characteristic sizes of regions ( i ) and ( ii ) depend on the atmospheric broadening of beam radii as @xmath35 , thus decreasing with increasing @xmath28 . in the case of long - distance propagation , @xmath36 is much smaller than the component of photon wave - vectors perpendicular to the @xmath28 axis . \n the last quantity grows with @xmath28 as @xmath37 . \n ( see ref . \n @xcite ) . for this reason , \n the overlapping of regions ( i ) and ( ii ) can be neglected . in this case \n eq . [ four ] can be rewritten in the convenient form : @xmath38 @xmath39 where the value @xmath40 , confining summation over @xmath41 , is chosen to be greater than @xmath42 but much smaller than the characteristic transverse wave vector of the photons ; this is consistent with the above explanations . \n the two terms in the right - hand side correspond to the two regions of four - wave correlations . \n the quantity @xmath43 entering the right side of eq . [ five ] is the operator of photon density in phase space ( the photon distribution function in @xmath44 space ) . \n it was used in refs . @xcite,@xcite and \n @xcite for the description of photon propagation in turbulent atmospheres . by analogy \n , we can define the two - time distribution function @xmath45 then eq . [ five ] can be rewritten in terms of the distribution functions as @xmath46    let us represent @xmath47 in the form @xmath48 . \n we assume that @xmath49 , as explained in the text after eq.[one ] . in this case \n the hamiltonian of photons in a turbulent atmosphere can be considered to be independent of time . as a result , both functions defined by eqs . \n [ six ] and [ seven ] satisfy the same kinetic equation , i.e.    @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the photon velocity , @xmath53 is a random force , caused by the turbulence . \n this force is equal to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the frequency of laser radiation . \n @xmath56 is the refractive index of the atmosphere . \n the general solution of the equation for @xmath48 can be written in the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 @xmath59 the functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 obey the equations of motion @xmath62 with the boundary conditions @xmath63 . \n the instant @xmath64 is equal to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the speed of light . \n @xmath64 is the time of the exit of photons from the source . \n this choice of @xmath64 makes it possible to neglect the influence of the turbulence on the initial values of operators @xmath67 ( their dependence on time is as in vacuum ) . \n the term for @xmath68 can be obtained from eq .

( see fig.1 ) . as we see , in this case the effect of phase fluctuations can be described by the schell model @xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .    a somewhat more complex situation is for the average value of @xmath94 given by eq .

        "abstract": "Research on laser beam propagation through turbulent atmospheres is critical for applications in remote sensing, tracking, and long-distance optical communications. However, coherent laser beams are significantly affected by atmospheric refractive index fluctuations, acquiring Gaussian statistical properties and increasing the noise/signal ratio over long distances. To counteract this, partially coherent beams using phase diffusers have been proposed, which can significantly reduce noise by altering the beam's phase. This study focuses on optimizing the use of phase diffusers to enhance communication system performance by theoretically analyzing the dependency of the scintillation index on various system parameters."

        "article": "the so - called `` nucleon spin crisis '' raised by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) measurement in 1988 is one of the most outstanding findings in the field of hadron physics @xcite,@xcite . \n the renaissance of the physics of high energy deep inelastic scatterings is greatly indebted to this epoch - making finding . \n probably , one of the most outstanding progresses achieved recently in this field of physics is the discovery and the subsequent research of completely new observables called generalized parton distribution functions ( gpd ) . \n it has been revealed that the gpds , which can be measured through the so - called deeply - virtual compton scatterings ( dvcs ) or the deeply - virtual meson productions ( dvmp ) , contain surprisingly richer information than the standard parton distribution functions @xcite@xcite . \n roughly speaking , the gpds are generalization of ordinary parton distributions and the elastic form factors of the nucleon . \n the gpds in the most general form are functions of three kinematical variables : the average longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 of the struck parton in the initial and final states , a skewdness parameter @xmath3 which measures the difference between two momentum fractions , and the four - momentum - transfer square @xmath4 of the initial and final nucleon . in the forward limit @xmath5 , \n some of the gpds reduce to the usual quark , antiquark and gluon distributions . \n on the other hand , taking the @xmath0-th moment of the gpds with respect to the variable @xmath1 , one obtains the generalizations of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon , which are called the generalized form factors of the nucleon . \n the complex nature of the gpds , i.e. the fact that they are functions of three variable , makes it quite difficult to grasp their full characteristics both experimentally and theoretically . from the theoretical viewpoint \n , it may be practical to begin studies with the two limiting cases . \n the one is the forward limit of zero momentum transfer . \n we have mentioned that , in this limit , some of the gpds reduce to the ordinary parton distribution function depending on one variable @xmath1 . \n however , it turns out that , even in this limit , there appear some completely new distribution functions , which can not be accessed by the ordinary inclusive deep - inelastic scattering measurements . \n very interestingly , it was shown by ji that one of such distributions contains valuable information on the total angular momentum carried by the quark fields in the nucleon @xcite@xcite . \n this information , combined with the known knowledge on the longitudinal quark polarization , makes it possible to determine the quark orbital angular momentum contribution to the total nucleon spin purely experimentally . \n another relatively - easy - to - handle quantities are the generalized form factors of the nucleon @xcite,@xcite , which are given as the non - forward nucleon matrix elements of the spin-@xmath0 , twist - two quark and gluon operators . \n since these latter quantities are given as the nucleon matrix elements of local operators , they can be objects of lattice qcd simulations . \n ( it should be compared with parton distributions . \n the direct calculation of parton distributions is beyond the scope of lattice qcd simulations , since it needs to treat the nucleon matrix elements of quark bilinears , which are _ nonlocal in time_. ) in fact , two groups , the lhpc collaboration and the qcdsf collaboration independently investigated the generalized form factors of the nucleon , and gave several interesting predictions , which can in principle be tested by the measurement of gpds in the near future @xcite@xcite . although interesting , there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe that the predictions of these lattice simulations are realistic enough . \n the reason is mainly that the above mentioned lattice simulation were carried out in the heavy pion regime around @xmath6 with neglect of the so - called disconnected diagrams . \n our real world is rather close to the chiral limit with vanishing pion mass , and we know that , in this limit , the goldstone pion plays very important roles in some intrinsic properties of the nucleon . \n the lattice simulation carried out in the heavy pion region is in danger of missing some important role of chiral dynamics .    on the other hand , \n the chiral quark soliton model ( cqsm ) is an effective model of baryons , which maximally incorporates the chiral symmetry of qcd and its spontaneous breakdown @xcite,@xcite . \n ( see @xcite@xcite for early reviews . ) \n it was already applied to the physics of ordinary parton distribution functions with remarkable success @xcite@xcite . for instance , an indispensable role of pion - like quark - antiquark correlation was shown to be essential to understand the famous nmc measurement , which revealed the dominance of the @xmath7-quark over the @xmath8-quark inside the proton @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . \n then , it would be interesting to see what predictions the cqsm would give for the quantities mentioned above . \n now , the main purpose of the present study is to study the generalized form factors of the nucleon within the framework of the cqsm and compare its predictions with those of the lattice qcd simulations . of our particular interest here \n is to see the change of final theoretical predictions against the variation of the pion mass . \n such an analysis is expected to give some hints for judging the reliability of the lattice qcd predictions at the present level for the observables in question . \n the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect.ii \n , we shall briefly explain how to introduce the nonzero pion mass into the scheme of the cqsm with pauli - villars regularization . in sect.iii \n , we derive the theoretical expressions for the generalized form factors of the nucleon . \n sect.iv is devoted to the discussion of the results of the numerical calculations . \n some concluding remarks are then given in sect.v . \n we start with the basic effective lagrangian of the chiral quark soliton model in the chiral limit given as @xmath9 with @xmath10 which describes the effective quark fields , with a dynamically generated mass @xmath11 , strongly interacting with pions @xcite,@xcite . \n since one of the main purposes of the present study is to see how the relevant observables depend on pion mass , we add to @xmath12 an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term @xmath13 given by @xcite @xmath14 . \n \\label{eq : lsb}\\ ] ] here the trace in ( [ eq : lsb ] ) is to be taken with respect to flavor indices . \n the total model lagrangian is therefore given by @xmath15 naturally , one could have taken an alternative choice in which the explicit chiral - symmetry - breaking effect is introduced in the form of current quark mass term as @xmath16 . \n we did not do so , because we do not know any consistent regularization of such effective lagrangian with finite current quark mass within the framework of the pauli - villars subtraction scheme , as explained in appendix of @xcite . \n the effective action corresponding to the above lagrangian is given as @xmath17 = s_f [ u ] + s_m [ u ] , \\label{eq : energsol}\\

the fermion ( quark ) part of the above action contains ultra - violet divergences . to remove these divergences , we must introduce physical cutoffs . for the purpose of regularization , here we use the pauli - villars subtraction scheme . as explained in @xcite , \n we must eliminate not only the logarithmic divergence contained in @xmath23 $ ] but also the quadratic and logarithmic divergence contained in the equation of motion shown below . \n to get rid of all these troublesome divergence , we need at least two subtraction terms . \n the regularized action is thus defined as @xmath24 = s_f^{reg } [ u ] + s_m [ u ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 = s_f [ u ] - \\sum_{i = 1}^2 \\,c_i \\,s_f^{\\lambda _ i } [ u ] .\\ ] ] here @xmath26 is obtained from @xmath27 $ ] with @xmath11 replaced by the pauli - villars regulator mass @xmath28 . \n these parameters are fixed as follows . \n first , the quadratic and logarithmic divergence contained in the equation of motion ( or in the expression of the vacuum quark condensate ) can , respectively , removed if the subtraction constants satisfy the following two conditions : @xmath29 ( we recall that the condition which removes the logarithmic divergence in @xmath23 $ ] just coincides with the 1st of the above conditions . ) by solving the above equations for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath32 which constrains the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , once @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given . for determining @xmath33 and @xmath34 \n , we use two conditions @xmath35 and @xmath36 which amounts to reproducing the correct normalization of the pion kinetic term in the effective meson lagrangian and also the empirical value of the vacuum quark condensate . to derive soliton equation of motion , we must first write down a regularized expression for the static soliton energy . under the hedgehog ansatz @xmath37 for the background pion fields , \n it is obtained in the form : @xmath38 = e_f^{reg } [ f ( r ) ] + e_m [ f ( r ) ] , \\

particular state @xmath48 , which is a discrete bound - state orbital coming from the upper dirac continuum under the influence of the hedgehog mean field , is called the valence level . \n the symbol @xmath49 in ( [ eq : regenerg ] ) denotes the summation over all the negative energy eigenstates of @xmath50 , i.e. the negative energy dirac continuum . \n the soliton equation of motion is obtained from the stationary condition of @xmath51 $ ] with respect to the variation of the profile function @xmath52 : @xmath53 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & 4 \\pi r^2 \\,\\left\\ { - \\,m \\,[s ( r ) \\sin f ( r

densities given as @xmath57 with @xmath58 while @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the corresponding densities evaluated with the regulator mass @xmath28 instead of the dynamical quark mass @xmath11 . \n we also note that @xmath61 and @xmath62 . as usual \n , a self - consistent soliton solution is obtained as follows with use of kahana and ripka s discretized momentum basis @xcite,@xcite . \n first by assuming an appropriate ( though arbitrary ) soliton profile @xmath52 , the eigenvalue problem of the dirac hamiltonian is solved . using the resultant eigenfunctions and their associated eigenenergies \n , one can calculate the regularized scalar and pseudoscalar densities @xmath55 and @xmath56 . \n with use of these @xmath63 and @xmath64 , eq.([eq : profile ] ) can then be used to obtain a new soliton profile @xmath52 . \n the whole procedure above is repeated with this new profile @xmath52 until the self - consistency is attained . \n since the generalized form factors of the nucleon are given as moments of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , it is convenient to start with the theoretical expressions of the unpolarized gpds @xmath65 and @xmath66 within the cqsm . following the notation in @xcite,@xcite \n , we introduce the quantities @xmath67 and @xmath68 here , the isoscalar and isovector combinations respectively correspond to the sum and the difference of the quark flavors @xmath69 and @xmath70 . the relation between these quantities and the generalized parton distribution functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 \n are obtained most conveniently in the so - called breit frame . \n they are given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 these two independent combinations of @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be extracted through the spin projection of @xmath75 as @xmath76 where  tr \" denotes the trace over spin indices , while @xmath77 . \n now , within the cqsm , it is possible to evaluate the right - hand side ( rhs ) of ( [ eq : hetrace ] ) and ( [ eq : emtrace ] ) . \n since the answers are already given in several previous papers @xcite@xcite , we do not repeat the derivation . here \n we comment only on the following general structure of the theoretical expressions for relevant observables in the cqsm . \n the leading contribution just corresponds to the mean field prediction , which is independent of the collective rotational velocity @xmath78 of the hedgehog soliton . \n the next - to - leading order term takes account of the linear response of the internal quark motion to the rotational motion as an external perturbation , and consequently it is proportional to @xmath78 . \n it is known that the leading - order term contributes to the isoscalar combination of @xmath79 and to the isovector combination of @xmath80 , while the isoscalar part of @xmath79 and the isovector part of @xmath80 survived only at the next - to - leading order of @xmath78 ( or of @xmath81 ) . \n the leading - order gpds are then given as @xmath82 here the symbol @xmath83 denotes the summation over the occupied ( the valence plus negative - energy dirac sea ) quark orbitals in the hedgehog mean field . on the other hand , \n the theoretical expressions for the isovector part of @xmath84 and the isoscalar part of @xmath85 , which survive at the next - to - leading order , are a little more complicated . \n they are given as double sums over the single quark orbitals as @xmath86 \\ \n ,   e^{i x m_n z^0 } \\nonumber \\\\   & \\ , & \\hspace{30 mm } \\times \\ \\langle n | \\tau^a | m \\rangle    \\langle m | \\,\\tau^a \\,(1 + \\gamma^0

gpdemiv ] ) , are the basic starting equations for our present study of the generalized form factors of the nucleon within the cqsm . \n there are infinite tower of generalized form factors , which are defined as the @xmath0-th moments of gpds . in the present study , \n we confine ourselves to the 1st and the 2nd moments , which respectively corresponds to the standard electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon and the so - called gravitational form factors . \n we are especially interested in the second one , since they are believed to contain valuable information on the spin contents of the nucleon through ji s angular momentum sum rule @xcite,@xcite . for each isospin channel , the 1st and the 2nd moments of @xmath89 define the sachs - electric and gravito - electric form factors

following , we shall explain how we can calculate the generalized form factors based on the theoretical expressions of corresponding gpds , by taking @xmath95 and @xmath96 as examples . \n setting @xmath97 and integrating over @xmath98 in ( [ eq : gpdheis ] ) , we obtain @xmath99 putting this expression into ( [ eq : ge10def ] ) , we have @xmath100 it is easy to see that , using the generalized

in the hedgehog mean field as @xmath138 and @xmath139 we recall that @xmath140 just coincides with the known expression of the isoscalar sachs - magnetic form factor of the nucleon in the cqsm @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath141 \n is sometimes called the gravitomagnetic form factor of the nucleon ( its isoscalar part ) , which we can evaluate within the qcsm based on the above theoretical expression . \n finally , the leading - order contribution to the isovector part of the generalized magnetic form factors are given as @xmath142 and @xmath143 especially interesting to us are the values of the generalized form factors in the forward limit @xmath5 . \n the consideration of this limit is also useful for verifying consistency of our theoretical analyses , since it leads to fundamental sum rules discussed below . \n we first consider the forward limit of @xmath95 . from ( [ eq : inthe10is ] ) , we find that @xmath144 subtracting the corresponding vacuum contribution , this reduces to @xmath145 . \n if we remember the relation @xmath146 the forward limit of ( [ eq : inthe10is ] ) just leads to the sum rule : @xmath147 which denotes that the sum of the @xmath69-quark and @xmath70-quark numbers in the proton is three . \n next we turn to the forward limit of @xmath96 , which gives @xmath148 it is easy to see that , after regularization and vacuum subtraction , the first term of the rhs of the above equation reduces to the fermion ( quark ) part of the soliton energy , i.e. @xmath149 in ( [ eq : estatic ] ) . \n it was proved in @xcite that , in the cqsm with vanishing pion mass , the following identity holds : @xmath150 in the case of finite pion mass , which we are handling , this identity does not hold . instead \n , we can prove ( see appendix ) that @xmath151 that is , the second term in the parenthesis of rhs of eq.([eq : momsum ] ) just coincides with the pion part of the soliton energy ( or mass ) . since the sum of the quark and pion part \n give the total soliton mass @xmath152 , we then find that @xmath153 in consideration of eq.([eq : inthe20is ] ) , this relation can also be expressed as @xmath154 which means that the total momentum fraction carried by quark fields ( the @xmath69- and @xmath70-quarks ) is just unity . \n this is an expected result , since the cqsm contains quark fields only ( note that the pion is not an independent field of quarks ) , so that the total nucleon momentum should be saturated by the quark fields alone .    taking the forward limit of @xmath155 \n , we are again led to a trivial sum rule , constrained by the conservation low . \n in fact , we have @xmath156 thereby leading to @xmath157 which denotes that the difference of the @xmath69-quark and the @xmath70-quark numbers in the proton is just unity . \n on the other hand , the forward limit of @xmath158 leads to the first nontrivial sum rule as @xmath159 since this quantity , which represents the difference of momentum fraction carried by the @xmath69-quark and the @xmath70-quark in the proton , is not constrained by any conservation law , its actual value can be estimated only numerically . \n next we turn to the discussion of the forward limit of the generalized magnetic form factors . \n first , the forward limit of @xmath140 gives @xmath160 which reproduces the known expression of the isoscalar magnetic moment of the nucleon in the cqsm @xcite . on the other hand , \n the forward limit of @xmath141 gives @xmath161 it was shown in @xcite that the rhs of the above equation is just unity , i.e. @xmath162 in consideration of ( [ eq : gm2nd ] ) , this identity can be recast into a little different form as @xmath163 \\,d x .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming the familiar angular momentum sum rule due to ji

because the cqsm is an effective quark model which contains no explicit gluon fields . \n the derived identity ( [ eq : gm20ist0 ] ) has still another interpretation . \n remembering the fact that @xmath141 consists of two parts as @xmath166 eq.([eq : gm20ist0 ] ) dictates that @xmath167 since it also holds that ( the momentum sum rule ) @xmath168 it immediately follows that @xmath169 which is interpreted as showing the absence of the _ net quark contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon_.    finally , we investigate the forward limit of the isovector combination of the generalized magnetic form factors . from eq . \n ( [ eq : mgivform ] ) , we get @xmath170 which reproduces the known expression of the isovector magnetic form factor of the nucleon in the cqsm . on the other hand , letting @xmath5 in ( [ eq : mg2ivform ] ) , we have @xmath171 as shown in @xcite , this sum rule can be recast into the form : @xmath172 where @xmath173 consists of two parts as @xmath174 here , the first part is given as a proton matrix element of the _ free field expression _ for the isovector total angular momentum operator of quark fields as @xmath175 with @xmath176 \\ ,

@xmath178 is fixed to its physical value , i.e. @xmath179 . for the mass parameter @xmath11 , there is some argument based on the instanton liquid picture of the qcd vacuum that it is not extremely far from @xmath180 @xcite . \n the previous phenomenological analysis of various static baryon observables based on this model prefer a slightly larger value of @xmath11 between @xmath180 and @xmath181 @xcite@xcite . in the present analysis , \n we use the value @xmath182 . with this value of @xmath182 , we prepare self - consistent soliton solutions for seven values of @xmath183 , i.e. @xmath184 and @xmath185 , in order to see the pion mass dependence of the generalized form factors etc . \n favorable physical predictions of the model will be obtained by using the value of @xmath182

factors of the nucleon : @xmath198    since the lattice simulations by the lhpc and qcdsf collaborations were carried out in the heavy pion region around @xmath199 and since the simulation in the small pion mass region is hard to perform , we think it interesting to investigate the pion mass dependence of the generalized form factors within the framework of the cqsm . for simplicity \n , we shall show the pion mass dependence of the generalized form factors at the zero momentum transfer only . \n we think it enough for our purpose because the generalized form factors at the zero momentum transfer contain the most important information for clarifying the underlying spin structure of the nucleon . at zero momentum transfer , \n the relations between the generalized dirac and pauli form factors and the generalized sachs - type form factors are simplified to become @xmath200 and @xmath201     and @xmath202 as functions of @xmath183 ( the filled diamonds ) , together with the corresponding lattice predictions . here \n , the open triangles correspond to the predictions of the lhpc group @xcite , while the open squares to those of the qcdsf collaboration

as for @xmath203 , \n the cqsm predictions and the lattice qcd predictions are both independent of @xmath183 and consistent with the constraint of the quark number sum rule : @xmath204 with high numerical precision . turning to @xmath202 , \n one finds a sizable difference between the predictions of the cqsm and of the lattice qcd . \n the lattice qcd predicts that @xmath205 which means that only about @xmath206 of the total nucleon momentum is carried by the quark fields , while the rest is borne by the gluon fields . on the other hand , the cqsm predictions for the same quantity \n is @xmath207 which means that the quark fields saturates the total nucleon momentum . \n this may certainly be a limitation of an effective quark model , which contains no explicit gluon fields . \n note , however , that the total quark momentum fraction @xmath202 is a scale dependent quantity . \n the lattice result corresponds to the energy scale of @xmath208 @xcite , while the cqsm prediction should be taken as that of the model energy scale around @xmath209 @xcite . \n we shall later make more meaningful comparison by taking care of the scale dependencies of relevant observables .     and \n @xmath210 as functions of @xmath183 , together with the corresponding lattice predictions @xcite,@xcite . \n the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig.[fig : a1020is].,width=604,height=264

. as for @xmath211 , \n both the cqsm and the lattice simulation reproduce the quark number sum rule @xmath212 with good prediction . turning to @xmath210 \n , one observes that the prediction of the cqsm shows somewhat peculiar dependence on the pion mass . \n starting from a fairly small value in the chiral limit ( @xmath213 ) , it first increases as @xmath183 increases , but as @xmath183 further increases it begins to decrease , thereby showing a tendency to match the lattice prediction in the heavy pion region . very interestingly , letting put aside the absolute value , a similar @xmath183 dependence is also observed in the chiral extrapolation of the lattice prediction for the momentum fraction @xmath214 shown in fig.25 of @xcite . \n physically , the quantity @xmath210 has a meaning of the difference of the momentum fractions carried by the @xmath69-quark and the @xmath70-quark . \n the empirical value for it is @xmath215 @xcite . \n one sees that the prediction of the cqsm in the chiral limit is not far from this empirical information , although more serious comparison must take account of the scale dependence of @xmath216 .     and @xmath217 as functions of @xmath183 , together with the corresponding lattice predictions @xcite,@xcite . \n the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig.[fig : a1020is].,width=604,height=264 ]    next , shown in fig.[fig : b1020is ] are the cqsm predictions for @xmath218 and @xmath217 . \n the former quantity is related to the isoscalar combination of the nucleon anomalous magnetic moment as @xmath219 . \n ( we recall that its empirical value is @xmath220 . ) \n we find that this quantity is very sensitive to the variation of the pion mass . \n it appears that the cqsm prediction @xmath221 corresponding to chiral limit underestimates the observation significantly . \n however , the difference is exaggerated too much in this comparison . in fact \n , if we carry out a comparison in the total isoscalar magnetic moment of the nucleon @xmath222 , the cqsm in the chiral limit gives @xmath223 in comparison with the observed value @xmath224 . to our knowledge , \n no theoretical predictions are given for this quantity by either of the lhpc or qcdsf collaborations . \n the right panel of fig.4 shows the predictions for @xmath217 , which is sometimes called the isoscalar part of the nucleon anomalous gravitomagnetic moment , or alternatively the _ net quark contribution to the nucleon anomalous gravitomagnetic moment_. as already pointed out , the prediction of the cqsm for this quantity is exactly zero : i.e. @xmath169 the explicit numerical calculation also confirms it . \n it should be recognized that the above result @xmath225 obtained in the cqsm is just a necessary consequence of the _ momentum sum rule _ and the _ total nucleon spin sum rule _ \n , both of which are saturated by the quark field only in the cqsm as @xmath226 and @xmath227   \\ = \\ \\langle j \\rangle^{u + d }

\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which constrains that only the sum of @xmath217 and @xmath229 is forced to vanish as @xmath230 ( while we neglect here the contributions of other quarks than the @xmath69- and @xmath70-quarks , it loses no generality in our discussion below . \n in fact , to include them , we have only to replace the combination @xmath231 by @xmath232 . ) \n the above nontrivial identity claims that the net contributions of quark and gluon fields to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon must be zero . \n an interesting question is whether the quark and gluon contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment vanishes separately or they are both large with opposite sign . \n a perturbative analysis based on a very simple toy model indicates the latter possibility @xcite . on the other hand \n , a nonperturbative analysis within the framework of the lattice qcd indicates that the net quark contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment is small or nearly zero , @xmath233 @xcite,@xcite . \n ( to be more precise , we sees that the prediction of the lhpc collaboration for @xmath217 is slightly negative @xcite , while that of the qcdsf group is slightly positive @xcite . ) \n this strongly indicates a surprising possibility that the quark and gluon contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon may separately vanish . \n worthy of special mention here is an interesting argument given by teryaev some years ago , claiming that the vanishing net quark contributions to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon , violated in perturbation theory , is expected to be restored in full nonperturbative qcd due to the confinement @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . very interestingly , \n once it actually happens , it leads to a surprisingly simple result , i.e. the proportionality of the quark momentum and angular momentum fraction @xmath234 as advocated by teryaev @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . \n a far reaching physical consequence resulting from this observation was extensively discussed in our recent report @xcite . \n ( see also the discussion at the end of this section . )     and @xmath235 as functions of @xmath183 , together with the corresponding lattice predictions @xcite,@xcite . \n the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig.[fig : a1020is].,width=604,height=264 ]    next , we show in fig.[fig : b1020iv ] the predictions for the isovector case , i.e. @xmath236 and @xmath235 . \n we recall first that the quantity @xmath236 represents the isovector combination of the nucleon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath237 , the empirical value of which is known to be @xmath238 . \n one find that this quantity is extremely sensitive to the variation of the pion mass especially near @xmath239 . \n this is only natural if one remembers the important role of the pion cloud in the isovector magnetic moment of the nucleon . \n ( one may notice that the prediction of the cqsm for @xmath240 underestimates a little its empirical value even in the chiral limit . \n we recall , however , that , within the framework of the cqsm , there is an important @xmath241 correction or the 1st order rotational correction to some kind of isovector quantities like the isovector magnetic moment of the nucleon in question or the axial - vector coupling constant of the nucleon @xcite@xcite . \n this next - to - leading correction in @xmath241 should also be taken into account in more advanced investigations . ) \n shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : b1020iv ] is the theoretical predictions for @xmath235 , the half of which can be interpreted as the difference of the total angular momentum carried by the @xmath69-quark and the @xmath70-quark fields according to ji s angular momentum sum rule @xcite . \n the cqsm predicts fairly small value for this quantity , in contrast to the lattice predictions of sizable magnitude . \n it seems that the pion mass dependence rescues this discrepancy only partially . \n here we argue that , the reason why the cqsm ( in the chiral limit ) gives rather small prediction for this quantity is intimately connected with the characteristic @xmath1 dependence of the quantity @xmath242 , the forward limit of the isovector unpolarized spin - flip gpd of the nucleon . to show it \n , we first recall that , within the theoretical frame work of the cqsm , @xmath236 as well as @xmath243 are calculated as difference of @xmath244 and @xmath245 and of @xmath246 and @xmath247 , respectively , as @xmath248 although the quantities of the rhs can be calculated directly without recourse to any distribution functions , they can also be evaluated as @xmath1-weighted integrals of the corresponding gpds as @xmath249 the distribution function @xmath242 has already been calculated within the cqsm in our recent paper @xcite . as shown there , \n the dirac sea contribution to this quantity has a sizably large peak around @xmath250 . \n since this significant peak due to the deformed dirac - sea quarks is approximately symmetric with respect to the reflection @xmath251 , it hardly contributes to the second moment @xmath252 , whereas it gives a sizable contribution to the first moment @xmath253 . \n the predicted significant peak of @xmath242 around @xmath250 can physically be interpreted as the effects of pion cloud . \n it can be convinced in several ways . \n first , we investigate how this behavior of @xmath242 changes as the pion mass is varied . \n obtained with @xmath182 and @xmath239.,width=340,height=264 ]     dependence of @xmath254.,width=604,height=264 ]    shown in fig.[fig : eiv_pi0 ] and in fig.[fig : eiv_pi24 ] are the cqsm predictions for @xmath242 with several values of @xmath183 . \n i.e. @xmath255 , and @xmath256 . \n one clearly sees that the height of the peak around @xmath250 , due to the deformed dirac - sea quarks , decreases rapidly as @xmath183 increases . \n this supports our interpretation of this peak as the effects of pion clouds . on the other hand \n , one also observes that the magnitude of the valence quark contribution , peaked around @xmath257 , gradually increases as @xmath183 becomes large . \n this behavior of @xmath242 turns out to cause a somewhat unexpected @xmath183 dependence of @xmath253 and @xmath252 . as a function of @xmath183 , the dirac sea contribution to \n @xmath253 decreases fast , whereas the valence quark contribution to it increases slowly , so that the total @xmath253 becomes a decreasing function of @xmath183 . on the other hand , \n owing to the approximate odd - function nature of the dirac sea contribution to @xmath258 with respect to @xmath1 , it hardly contributes to @xmath259 independent of the pion mass , while the valence quark contribution to @xmath258 is an increasing function of @xmath183 , thereby leading to the result that the net @xmath259 is a increasing function of @xmath183 . \n obtained with @xmath182 and @xmath239.,width=340,height=264 ]     dependence of @xmath260.,width=604,height=264 ]    we can give still another support to the above - mentioned interpretation of the contribution of the dirac - sea quarks . to see it , \n we first recall that the theoretical unpolarized distribution function @xmath261 appearing in the decomposition @xmath262 also has a sizable peak around @xmath250 due to the deformed dirac - sea quarks . as shown in fig.[fig : fiv_pi0 ] and in fig.[fig : fiv_pi24 ] , this peak is again a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath183 , supporting our interpretation of it as the effects of pion clouds . here \n , we can say more . \n we point out that this small-@xmath1 behavior of @xmath261 is just what is required by the famous nmc measurement @xcite . to confirm it , \n first remember that the distribution @xmath263 in the negative @xmath1 region should actually be interpreted as the distribution of antiquarks . to be explicit \n , it holds that @xmath264 the large and positive value of @xmath261 in the negative @xmath1 region close to @xmath250 means that @xmath265 is negative , i.e. the dominance of the @xmath7-quark over the @xmath8-quark inside the proton , which has been established by the nmc measurement @xcite \n .     evolved to @xmath266 and @xmath267 in comparison with the hermes and nutev data at the corresponding energy scales @xcite,@xcite.,width=340,height=283 ]    shown in fig.[fig : dbdu ] are the predictions of the cqsm for @xmath268 evolved to the high energy scales corresponding to the experimental observation @xcite . \n ( the theoretical predictions here were obtained with @xmath182 and @xmath269 . ) \n the model reproduces well the observed behavior of @xmath268 , although the magnitude of the flavor asymmetry in smaller @xmath1 region seems to be slightly overestimated . \n it is a widely accepted fact that this flavor asymmetry of the sea quark distribution in the proton can physically be understood as the effects of pion cloud at least qualitatively @xcite@xcite . \n this then supports our interpretation of the effects of the deformed dirac - sea quarks in @xmath242 and @xmath261 as the effects of pion clouds .    .the \n @xmath270 dependencies of @xmath271 , @xmath272 , and @xmath273 in the cqsm with @xmath182 . \n [ tabivb20 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n in this paper , we have investigated the generalized form factors of the nucleon , which will be extracted through near - future measurements of the generalized parton distribution functions , within the framework of the cqsm . \n a particular emphasis is put on the pion mass dependence as well as the scale dependence of the model predictions , which we compare with the corresponding predictions of the lattice qcd by the lhpc and the qcdsf collaborations carried out in the heavy pion regime around @xmath199 . \n the generalized form factors contain the ordinary electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon such as the dirac and pauli form factors of the proton and the neutron . \n we have shown that the cqsm with good chiral symmetry reproduces well the general behaviors of the observed electromagnetic form factors , while the lattice simulations by the above two groups have a tendency to underestimate the electromagnetic sizes of the nucleon . undoubtedly , this can not be unrelated to the fact that the above two lattice simulations were performed with unrealistically heavy pion mass . \n we have also tried to figure out the underlying spin contents of the nucleon through the analysis of the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic form factors of the nucleon , by taking care of the pion mass despondencies as well as of the scale dependencies of the relevant quantities . after taking account of the scale dependencies by means of the qcd evolution equations at the nlo in the @xmath274 scheme , \n the cqsm predicts , at @xmath275 , that @xmath276 , and @xmath277 , which means that the quark orbital angular momentum carries sizable amount of total nucleon spin even at such a relatively high energy scale . \n it contradicts the conclusion of the lhpc and qcdsf collaborations indicating that the total orbital angular momentum of quarks is very small or consistent with zero . \n it should be recognized , however , that the prediction of the cqsm for the total quark angular momentum is not extremely far from the corresponding lattice prediction @xmath278 at the same renormalization scale . \n the cause of discrepancy can therefore be traced back to the lhpc and qcdsf lattice qcd predictions for the quark spin fraction @xmath279 around 0.6 , which contradicts not only the prediction of the cqsm but also the emc observation . as was shown in our recent paper @xcite , @xmath279 is such a quantity that is extremely sensitive to the variation of the pion mass , especially in the region close to the chiral limit . \n more serious lattice qcd studies on the @xmath270-dependence of @xmath279 is highly desirable . \n worthy of special mention is the fact that , once we accept a theoretical postulate @xmath280 , i.e , the absence of the net quark contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon , which is supported by both of the lhpc and qcdsf lattice simulations , we are necessarily led to a surprisingly simple relations , @xmath281 and @xmath282 , i.e. the proportionality of the linear and angular momentum fractions carried by the quarks and the gluons . using these relations , together with the existing empirical information for the unpolarized and the longitudinally polarized pdfs \n , we can give _ model - independent predictions _ for the quark and gluon contents of the nucleon spin . \n for instance , with combined use of the mrst2004 fit @xcite and the dns2005 fit @xcite , we obtain @xmath283 , @xmath284 , and @xmath285 at @xmath275 . since @xmath286 ( as well as @xmath287 ) is a rapidly decreasing function of the energy scale , while the scale dependence of @xmath279 is very weak \n , we must conclude that the former is even more dominant over the latter at the scale below @xmath288 where any low energy models are supposed to hold . \n the situation is a little more complicated in the flavor - nonsinglet ( or isovector ) channel , because @xmath289 , and also because the cqsm and the lattice qcd give fairly different predictions for @xmath271 . as compared with the lattice prediction for @xmath271 around @xmath290 , the predictions of the cqsm turns out to be around @xmath291 . \n we have argued that the relatively small value of @xmath246 obtained in the cqsm is intimately connected with the small @xmath1 enhancement of the generalized parton distribution @xmath292 , which is dominated by the clouds of pionic @xmath293 excitation around @xmath294 . \n ( we recall that the 2nd moment of @xmath292 gives @xmath246 . ) \n unfortunately , such a @xmath1-dependent distribution as @xmath292 can not be accessed within the framework of lattice qcd . \n still , the predicted small @xmath1 behavior of @xmath295 as well as of @xmath296 indicates again the importance of chiral dynamics in the nucleon structure function physics , which has not been fully accounted for in the lattice qcd simulation at the present level . \n this work is supported in part by a grant - in - aid for scientific research for ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan ( no .  c-16540253 ) \n here we closely follow the proof of the momentum sum rule given in @xcite , by taking into account a necessary modification in the case of @xmath297 . \n the starting point is the following expression for the soliton mass ( or the static soliton energy ) : @xmath298   \\ - \\ ( h \\rightarrow h_0 ) \\ + \\ \n e_m , \\ ] ] with @xmath299 \\ = \\ - \\,f_\\pi^2 \\,m_\\pi^2 \\,\\int \\ , [   \\cos f(r ) - 1 ] \\,d^3 x . \n \\label{eq : emeson}\\ ] ] the soliton mass must be stationary with respect to an arbitrary variation of the chiral field @xmath300 or equivalently the soliton profile @xmath52 , which lead to a saddle point equation : @xmath301    \\ + \\ \\delta e_m \\ = \\ 0 .\\ ] ] here we consider a particular ( dilatational ) variation of chiral field @xmath302 for infinitesimal @xmath3 , we have @xmath303 so that @xmath304   \\ = \\ \\xi \\ , ( [ x^k \\partial_k , h ] - i \\gamma^0 \\gamma^k \\partial_k ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] noting the identity @xmath305 ) \\ = \n \\    \\mbox{sp } ( [ h , \\theta ( e_0 - h + i \\varepsilon ) ] x^k \\partial_k )   \\ = \\ 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we therefore obtain a key identity @xmath306 = - \\,\\delta e_m . \n \\label{eq : keyid}\\ ] ] now , by using ( [ eq : emeson ] ) together with the relations , @xmath307 we get @xmath308 here , taking account of the boundary condition @xmath309 we can manipulate as @xmath310 we thus find an important relation : @xmath311 putting this relation into ( [ eq : keyid ] ) , we have @xmath312 or @xmath313 if we evaluate the trace sum above by using the eigenstates of the static dirac hamiltonian @xmath50 as a complete set of basis , ( [ eq : traceap ] ) can also be written as @xmath314 which is the relation quoted in ( [ eq : alfp ] ) . \n we point out that our result has a correct chiral limit , since @xmath315 as @xmath316 and therefore @xmath317 in conformity with the proof given in ref.@xcite .",
        "abstract": "The 'nucleon spin crisis' ignited by the European Muon Collaboration in 1988 has significantly influenced high-energy hadron physics, highlighting the importance of Generalized Parton Distribution Functions (GPDs). GPDs offer comprehensive insights into nucleon structure, extending beyond traditional parton distribution functions by encapsulating dependencies on three kinematic variables: the average longitudinal momentum fraction, skewdness parameter, and four-momentum-transfer square. This study focuses on the implications of GPDs, their experimental challenges, and theoretical complexities. Theoretical advances, including lattice QCD simulations and Chiral Quark Soliton Model predictions, are compared to delineate the behavior of nucleon form factors under variations in pion mass, aiming to resolve discrepancies in current understanding."

fundamental question of completeness and linear independence of the family @xmath12 where @xmath13 . \n this question has received some attention recently @xcite , with a particular emphasis on the case @xmath14 . \n in the latter instance , @xmath15 is the set of eigenfunctions of the generalised eigenvalue problem for the one - dimensional @xmath16-laplacian subject to dirichlet boundary

) and let @xmath31 be the linear isometry such that @xmath32 . \n then @xmath33 so that the change of coordinates takes the form @xmath34    notions of `` nearness '' between bases of banach spaces are known to play a fundamental role in classical mathematical analysis , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite . \n unfortunately , the expansion strongly suggests that @xmath21 is not globally `` near '' @xmath18 , e.g. in the krein - lyusternik or the paley - wiener sense , @xcite . \n therefore classical arguments , such as those involving the paley - wiener stability theorem , are unlikely to be directly applicable in the present context . \n in fact , more rudimentary methods can be invoked in order to examine the invertibility of the change of coordinates map . from it \n follows that @xmath35 in @xcite it was claimed that the left side of held true for all @xmath36 where @xmath37 was determined to lie in the segment @xmath38 . \n hence @xmath21 would be a schauder basis , whenever @xmath39 . \n further developments in this respect were recently reported by bushell and edmunds @xcite . \n these authors cleverly fixed a gap originally published in ( * ? ? ? \n * lemma  5 ) and observed that , as the left side of ceases to hold true whenever @xmath40 the argument will break for @xmath14 near @xmath41 . \n therefore , the basisness question for @xmath21 should be tackled by different means in the regime @xmath42 . \n more recently @xcite , edmunds , gurka and lang , employed in order to show invertibility of @xmath43 for general pairs @xmath44 , as long as @xmath45 since is guaranteed whenever @xmath46 this allows @xmath47 for @xmath48 \n . however , note that a direct substitution of @xmath14 in , only leads to the sub - optimal condition @xmath49 .    in section  [

that @xmath43 is a homeomorphism of @xmath51 in a neighbourhood of the region in the @xmath44-plane where @xmath52 see theorem  [ inprovement ] and also corollary  [ beyonda ] . for this purpose , in section  [ criteria ] we find two further criteria which generalise in the hilbert space setting , see corollaries  [ main_1 ] and [ main_2 ] . in this case , the _ riesz constant _ , @xmath53 characterises how @xmath21 deviates from being an orthonormal basis . \n these new statements yield upper bounds for @xmath54 , which improve upon those obtained from the right side of , even when the latter is applicable . \n the formulation of the alternatives to presented below relies crucially on work developed in section  [ toep_s ] . from lemma  [ multareshifts ] \n we compute explicitly the wold decomposition of the isometries @xmath31 : they turn out to be shifts of infinite multiplicity \n . hence we can extract from the expansion suitable components which are toeplitz operators of scalar type acting on appropriate hardy spaces . as the theory becomes quite technical for the case @xmath55 and all the estimates analogous to those reported below would involve a dependence on the parameter @xmath56 \n , we have chosen to restrict our attention with regards to these improvements only to the already interesting hilbert space setting . \n section  [ casep = q ] is concerned with particular details of the case of equal indices @xmath14 , and it involves results on both the general case @xmath20 and the specific case @xmath57 . \n rather curiously , we have found another gap which renders incomplete the proof of invertibility of @xmath43 for @xmath58 originally published in @xcite . \n see remark  [ rem_gap ] . \n moreover , the application of ( * ? ? ? \n * theorem  4.5 ) only gets to a _ \n basisness threshold _ of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is defined by the identity @xmath61 see also ( * ? ? ? \n * remark  2.1 ) . in theorem  [ fixingbbcdg ] \n we show that @xmath21 is indeed a schauder basis of @xmath22 for @xmath62 where @xmath63 , see ( * ? ? ? \n * problem  1 ) . as @xmath64 , basisness \n is now guaranteed for all @xmath65 . \n see figure  [ impro_fig_p = q ] . \n in section  [ nume ] we report on our current knowledge of the different thresholds for invertibility of the change of coordinates map , both in the case of equal indices and otherwise . based on the new criteria found in section  [ criteria ] , we formulate a general test of invertibility for @xmath43 which is amenable to analytical and numerical investigation . \n this test involves finding sharp bounds on the first few coefficients @xmath66 . \n see proposition  [ beyond2 ] . for the case of equal indices \n , this test indicates that @xmath21 is a riesz basis of @xmath51 for @xmath67 where @xmath68 . \n all the numerical quantities reported in this paper are accurate up to the last digit shown , which is rounded to the nearest integer . in the appendix \n we have included fully reproducible computer codes which can be employed to verify the calculations reported . \n a family @xmath69 in a banach space is called @xmath50-linearly independent @xcite , if @xmath70    [ likernelandspan ] for all @xmath1 , the family @xmath21 is @xmath50-linearly independent in @xmath22 . \n moreover , if the linear extension of the map @xmath23 is a bounded operator @xmath71 , then @xmath72    for the first assertion we show that @xmath73 . \n let @xmath74 be such that @xmath75 where the series is convergent in the norm of @xmath22 . \n then @xmath76 hence @xmath77 we show that all @xmath78 by means of a double induction argument . \n suppose that @xmath79 . \n we prove that all @xmath80 . indeed , clearly @xmath81 from with @xmath82 . \n now assume inductively that @xmath29 for all @xmath83 . from for @xmath84 \n we get @xmath85 then @xmath80 for all @xmath86 . as this \n would contradict the fact that @xmath87 , necessarily @xmath88 . \n suppose now inductively that @xmath89 and @xmath90 . \n we prove that again all @xmath80 . \n firstly , @xmath81 from with @xmath91 , because @xmath92 secondly , assume by induction that @xmath29 for all @xmath93 . from for @xmath94 \n we get @xmath95 the latter equality is a consequence of the fact that , for @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 , either @xmath99 ( indices for the @xmath100 ) or @xmath101 ( indices for the @xmath102 ) . \n hence @xmath80 for all @xmath86 . \n as this would again contradict the fact that @xmath87 , necessarily all @xmath103 so that @xmath104 . \n the second assertion is shown as follows . \n assume that @xmath105 . \n if @xmath106 , then @xmath107 for all @xmath108 , so @xmath109 which in turns means that @xmath110 for all @xmath111 . on the other hand , if the latter holds true for @xmath112 , then @xmath113 for all @xmath114 , so @xmath115 , as required .    therefore , @xmath21 is a riesz basis of @xmath51 if and only if @xmath105 and @xmath116 . \n a simple example illustrates how a family of dilated periodic functions can break its property of being a riesz basis . \n [ ex1 ] let @xmath117 $ ] . \n take @xmath118 by virtue of lemma  [ toep ] below , @xmath119 is a riesz basis of @xmath51 if and only if @xmath120 . \n for @xmath121 we have an orthonormal set . \n however it is not complete , as it clearly misses the infinite - dimensional subspace @xmath122 . \n the fundamental decomposition of @xmath43 given in allows us to extract suitable components formed by toeplitz operators of scalar type , @xcite . in order to identify these components , we begin by determining the wold decomposition of the isometries @xmath31 , @xcite \n . see remark  [ diri ] . \n [ multareshifts ] for all @xmath123 , @xmath124 is a shift of infinite multiplicity . \n define @xmath125 then @xmath126 for @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 one - to - one and onto for all @xmath130 . \n therefore indeed @xmath31 is a shift of multiplicity @xmath131 . \n let @xmath132 . \n the hardy spaces of functions in @xmath133 with values in the banach space @xmath134 are denoted below by @xmath135 . \n let @xmath136 be a holomorphic function on @xmath137 and fix @xmath138 . \n let @xmath139 let the corresponding toeplitz operator ( * ? ? ? \n * ( 5 - 1 ) ) @xmath140 let @xmath141 by virtue of lemma  [ multareshifts ] ( see ( * ? ? ? * and

@xmath147    observe that @xmath148 is scalar analytic in the sense of @xcite . \n since @xmath149 is holomorphic in @xmath137 , then @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( * ? ? ? \n * theorem  a(iii ) ) .    if @xmath152 , then @xmath153 is also holomorphic in @xmath137 . \n the scalar toeplitz operator @xmath154 is invertible if and only if @xmath146 . \n moreover , @xcite , @xmath155 the matrix of @xmath148 has the block representation @xcite @xmath156 the matrix associated to @xmath154 has exactly the same scalar form , replacing @xmath157 by @xmath158 . then , @xmath148 is invertible if and only if @xmath154 is invertible , and @xmath159 hence @xmath160    [ pert ] let @xmath161 for @xmath145 as in . if @xmath162 , then @xmath43 is invertible . \n moreover @xmath163    since @xmath145 is invertible , write @xmath164 . \n if additionally @xmath165 , then @xmath166    [ diri ] it is possible to characterise the change of coordinates @xmath43 in terms of dirichlet series , and recover some of the results here and below directly from this characterisation . \n see for example the insightful paper @xcite and the complete list of references provided in the addendum @xcite . \n however , the full technology of dirichlet series is not needed in the present context . \n a further development in this direction will be reported elsewhere . \n a proof of can be achieved by applying corollary  [ pert ] assuming that @xmath167 our next goal is to formulate concrete sufficient condition for the invertibility of @xmath43 and corresponding bounds on @xmath54 , which improve upon whenever @xmath57 . for this purpose \n we apply corollary  [ pert ] assuming that @xmath145 has now the three - term expansion @xmath168    let @xmath169 let @xmath170 see figure  [ region ] . \n

\n the operator @xmath174 is invertible if and only if @xmath175 . \n moreover @xmath176    let @xmath177 be associated with @xmath145 as in section  [ toep_s ] . \n the first assertion is a consequence of the following observation . if @xmath178 , then @xmath179 has roots @xmath180 conjugate with each other and @xmath181 \n if and only if @xmath182 . otherwise @xmath179 has two real roots . \n if @xmath183 and @xmath184 , then the smallest in modulus root of @xmath179 would lie in @xmath137 if and only if @xmath185 . \n if @xmath186 and @xmath187 , then the root of @xmath179 that is smallest in modulus would lie in @xmath137 if and only if @xmath188 . \n for the second assertion , let @xmath175 and @xmath189 . \n by virtue of the maximum principle on @xmath179 and @xmath190 ,

theorem \n [ generic_toep ] , we obtain the claimed statement .    since @xmath201 for all @xmath202 , then @xmath203 . \n below we substitute @xmath204 and @xmath205 , then apply lemma  [ toep ] appropriately in order to determine the invertibility of @xmath43 whenever pairs @xmath44 lie in different regions of the @xmath44-plane . for this purpose \n we establish the following hierarchy between @xmath206 and @xmath207 for @xmath208 , whenever the latter are non - negative . \n [ ajint ] for @xmath209 or @xmath210 , we have @xmath211 .    firstly observe that @xmath212 is continuous ,

\n [ a9l ] @xmath314 for all @xmath315    all the stated bounds are determined by integrating a suitable approximation of @xmath316 . \n each one requires a different set of quadrature points , but the general structure of the arguments in all cases is similar . without further mention , \n below we repeatedly use the fact that in terms of hypergeometric functions , @xmath317.\\ ] ]      let @xmath318 for @xmath319 let @xmath320 see figure  [ fig : interp ] . since @xmath321 and @xmath322 is an increasing function of @xmath323 , then @xmath324    according to ( * ? ? ? \n * corollary  4.4 ) , @xmath316 increases as @xmath16 decreases for any fixed @xmath325 . \n let @xmath16 be as in the hypothesis . \n then @xmath326 and similarly @xmath327 by virtue of ( * ? ? ? \n * lemma  3 ) the function @xmath322 is strictly concave for @xmath323 . \n then , in fact , @xmath328    let @xmath329 since @xmath330 for @xmath331 and @xmath332 , @xmath333      note that @xmath334 set @xmath335 then @xmath336 and so @xmath337 also @xmath338 \n so @xmath339    let @xmath16 be as in the hypothesis . \n then , similarly to the previous case [ a3l ] , @xmath340 set @xmath341 by strict concavity and , @xmath342 let @xmath343 then @xmath344 as claimed . \n let @xmath16 be as in the hypothesis . \n set @xmath345 then @xmath346 hence @xmath347 put @xmath348 then , @xmath349 let @xmath350 since @xmath351 is negative for @xmath352 and positive for @xmath353 , then @xmath354 . \n hence @xmath355      note that @xmath356 let @xmath16 be as in the hypothesis . \n set @xmath357 then @xmath358 hence @xmath347 put @xmath359 then , @xmath360 let @xmath361 then @xmath362 . \n hence @xmath363    the next statement is a direct consequence of combining [ a3l ] and [ a9l ] from this lemma with theorem  [ inprovement ] . \n [ beyonda ] set @xmath57 and suppose that @xmath364 is such that @xmath365 there exists @xmath366 such that @xmath43 is invertible for all @xmath367 . \n see figure  [ impro_fig_p = q ] . \n [ rem_gap ] in @xcite it was claimed that the hypothesis of held true whenever @xmath36 for a suitable @xmath368 . \n the argument supporting this claim @xcite was separated into two cases : @xmath369 and @xmath370 . with our definition by a factor of @xmath371 . \n note that the ground eigenfunction of the @xmath16-laplacian equation in @xcite is denoted by @xmath372 and it equals @xmath373 as defined above . \n a key observation here is the @xmath16-pythagorean identity @xmath374 . \n ] of the fourier coefficients , in the latter case it was claimed that @xmath375 was bounded above by @xmath376 as it turns , there is a missing power 2 in the term @xmath377 for this claim to be true . \n this corresponds to taking second derivatives of @xmath378 and it can be seen by applying the cauchy - schwartz inequality in . \n the missing factor is crucial in the argument and renders the proof of ( * ? ? ? \n * theorem  1 ) incomplete in the latter case .    in the paper \n @xcite published a few years later , it was claimed that the hypothesis of held true for @xmath379 where @xmath60 is defined by . \n it was then claimed that an approximated solution of was near @xmath380 . \n an accurate numerical approximation of , based on analytical bounds on @xmath381 , give the correct digits @xmath382 . \n therefore neither the results of @xcite nor those of @xcite include a complete proof of invertibility of the change of coordinates in a neighbourhood of @xmath383 .    accurate numerical estimation of @xmath381 show that the identity is valid as long as @xmath384 , which improves slightly upon the value @xmath60 from @xcite . \n however , as remarked in @xcite , the upper bound @xmath385 ensuring and hence the validity of theorem  [ impro_implicit]-[aimplicit ] , is too crude for small values of @xmath16 . note for example that the correct regime is @xmath386 whereas @xmath387 as @xmath388 ( see appendix  [ ap1 ] ) . \n therefore , in order to determine invertibility of @xmath43 in the vicinity of @xmath389 , it is necessary to find sharper bounds for the first few terms @xmath375 , and employ directly . \n this is the purpose of the next lemma . \n see figure  [ impro_fig_p = q ] . \n [ ajbounds ] let @xmath312 \n . then    1 . \n [ a1l ] @xmath390 2 . \n [ a3u ] @xmath391 3 . \n [ a5u ] @xmath392 4 . \n [ a7u ] @xmath393    we proceed in a similar way as in the proof of lemma  [ ajpositive ] . \n let @xmath16 be as in the hypothesis \n .      set @xmath394 then @xmath395 and so @xmath347 let @xmath396 then , @xmath397 hence @xmath398      set @xmath399 then @xmath400 let @xmath401 then , @xmath402 and hence @xmath403      set @xmath404 and let @xmath405 then , @xmath406 , so @xmath407      set @xmath408 and @xmath409 then , @xmath406 and @xmath410 , so @xmath411    the following result fixes the proof of the claim made in ( * ? ? ? \n * claim  2 ) and improves the threshold of invertibility determined in ( * ? ? ? \n * theorem  4.5 ) . \n [ fixingbbcdg ] there exists @xmath412 , such that @xmath413\\pi^2}{2\\sqrt{2}\\left ( \\frac{\\pi^2}{8}-1- \\frac19-\\frac{1}{25}-\\frac{1}{49 }   \\right ) }

the parameter @xmath416 . \n the right hand side is bounded . \n the left side is decreasing as @xmath16 increases and @xmath387 as @xmath388 . by virtue of lemma  [ ajbounds ] , @xmath417 hence the first statement is ensured as a consequence of the intermediate value theorem .    from \n , it follows that @xmath418 for all @xmath419 . \n lemma  [ ajpositive ] guarantees positivity of @xmath207 for @xmath420 . \n then , by re - arranging this inequality , the second statement becomes a direct consequence of . \n a sharp numerical approximation of the solution of the equation with equality in gives @xmath421 . \n see figure  [ impro_fig_p = q ] . \n if sharp bounds on the first few fourier coefficients @xmath259 are at hand , the approach employed above for the proof of theorem  [ fixingbbcdg ] can also be combined with the criteria or . a natural question is whether this would lead to a positive answer to the question of invertibility for @xmath43 , whenever @xmath422 in the case of , we see below that this is indeed the case . \n the key statement is summarised as follows . \n [ beyond2 ] let @xmath57 and @xmath423 . \n suppose that    1 . \n @xmath290 , @xmath245 and @xmath424 for all other @xmath425 . \n 2 .   @xmath426 .    if @xmath427 then @xmath43 is invertible . \n assume that the hypotheses are satisfied . \n the combination of and gives @xmath428 then @xmath429 and so the conclusion follows from . \n we now discuss the connection between the different statements established in the previous sections with those of the papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for this purpose \n we consider various accurate approximations of @xmath207 and @xmath430 . \n these approximations are based on the next explicit formulae : @xmath431 and @xmath432 here @xmath433 is the incomplete beta function , @xmath434 is the beta function and @xmath435 is the gamma function . \n moreover , by considering exactly the steps described in @xcite for the proof of ( * ? ? ? \n * ( 4.15 ) ) , it follows that @xmath436{\\mathrm{d}}x \\\\                    & = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}\\int_0 ^ 1 \\log\\left[\\cot \\left ( \\frac{\\pi}{4 } \\ \n { \\mathcal{i}}\\ ! \n \\!\\left(\\frac1q,\\frac{p-1}{p};x^q\\right )    \\right)\\right ] { \\mathrm{d}}x . \n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    . \n the positions of @xmath37 , @xmath437 and the value of @xmath438 are set only for illustration purposes , as we are only certain that @xmath439 . \n black indicates relevance to the general case @xmath20 while red indicates relevance for the case @xmath57 . \n [ impro_fig_p = q],height=241 ]    let us begin with the case of equal indices . \n see figure  [ impro_fig_p = q ] . as mentioned in the introduction , @xmath440 for @xmath41 . \n the condition @xmath441 is fulfilled for all @xmath442 where @xmath443 . \n the fourier coefficients @xmath444 for all @xmath445 whenever @xmath446 . \n remarkably we need to get to @xmath447 , for a numerical verification of the conditions of proposition  [ beyond2 ] allowing @xmath448 . \n indeed we remark the following .    1 .   for @xmath449 , \n the condition hold true only for @xmath450 where @xmath451 . \n 2 .   for @xmath447 \n the condition does hold true for @xmath452 where @xmath68 . \n this indicates that that the threshold for invertibility of @xmath43 in the hilbert space setting for @xmath14 is at least @xmath453 . \n now we examine the general case . \n the graphs shown in figures  [ th10ab ] and [ th10c ] correspond to regions in the @xmath44-plane near @xmath454 . \n curves on figure  [ th10ab ] that are in red are relevant only to the hilbert space setting @xmath57 . \n black curves pertain to @xmath20 . \n figure  [ th10ab]-_(a ) _ and a blowup shown in figure  [ th10ab]-_(b ) _ , have two solid ( black ) lines . \n one that shows the limit of applicability of theorem  [ impro_implicit]-[aimplicit ] and one that shows the limit of applicability of the result of @xcite . \n the dashed line indicates where occurs . to the left of that curve \n is not applicable . \n there are two filled regions of different colours in _ ( a ) _ , which indicate where @xmath455 and where @xmath456 for @xmath208 . \n proposition  [ beyond2 ] is not applicable in the union of these regions . \n we also show the lines where @xmath457 and @xmath458 . \n the latter forms part of the boundary of this union . the solid red line corresponding to the limit of applicability of theorem  [ impro_implicit]-[bimplicit ] is also included in figure  [ th10ab]-_(a)(d)_. to the right of that line , in the white area , we know that @xmath43 is invertible for @xmath57 . the blowup in figure  [ th10ab]-_(b ) \n _ clearly shows the gap between theorem  [ impro_implicit]-[aimplicit ] and theorem  [ impro_implicit]-[bimplicit ] in this @xmath57 setting . \n certainly @xmath459 is a point of intersection for all curves where @xmath29 for @xmath123 . \n these curves are shown in figure  [ th10ab]-_(c ) _ also for @xmath460 and @xmath461 . in this figure \n , we also include the boundary of the region where @xmath455 and the region where @xmath456 now for @xmath462 . \n note that the curves for @xmath463 and @xmath458 form part of the boundary of the latter . comparing _ ( a ) _ and _ ( c ) _ , the new line that cuts the @xmath16 axis at @xmath464 corresponds to the limit of where proposition  [ beyond2 ] for @xmath465 is applicable ( for @xmath16 to the right of this line ) . \n the gap between the two red lines ( case @xmath57 ) indicates that proposition  [ beyond2 ] can significantly improve the threshold for basisness with respect to a direct application of theorem  [ impro_implicit]-[bimplicit ] . \n as we increase @xmath466 , the boundary of the corresponding region moves to the left , see the blowups in figure  [ th10ab]-_(d ) _ and _ ( e)_. the two further curves in red located very close to the vertical axis , correspond to the precise value of the parameter @xmath466 where proposition  [ beyond2 ] allows a proof of invertibility for the change of coordinates which includes the break made by . for @xmath467 \n the region does not include the dashed black line , for @xmath447 it does include this line . \n the region shown in blue indicates a possible place where corollary  [ main_1 ] may still apply , but further investigation in this respect is needed . \n figure  [ th10c ] concerns the statement of theorem  [ impro_implicit]-[cimplicit ] . \n the small wedge shown in green is the only place where the former is applicable . \n as it turns , it appears that the conditions of corollary  [ main_2 ] prevent it to be useful for determining invertibility of @xmath43 in a neighbourhood of @xmath454 . \n however in the region shown in green , the upper bound on the riesz constant consequence of is sharper than that obtained from . \n part of the difficulties for a proof of basisness for the family @xmath21 in the regime @xmath470 has to do the fact that the fourier coefficients of @xmath471 approach those of the function @xmath472 . in this appendix \n we show that , indeed @xmath473    note that @xmath474    let @xmath475 be the ( unique ) value , such that @xmath476 then @xmath477 let @xmath478 be the line passing through the points @xmath479 and @xmath480 . \n there exists a unique value @xmath481 such that @xmath482 this value is unique because of monotonicity of both sides of this equality , and it exists by bisection . \n as all the functions involved are continuous in @xmath16 , then also @xmath483 is continuous in the parameter @xmath16 . \n moreover , @xmath484 indeed , by clearing the equation defining @xmath483 , we get @xmath485 the right hand side , and thus the left hand side , approach 0 as @xmath388 . \n then , one ( and hence both ) of the two terms multiplying on the left should approach 0 . \n let @xmath486 be the polygon which has as vertices ( ordered clockwise ) @xmath487 as @xmath488 @xmath489\\times\\{0\\ } ) \\cup ( \\{1\\}\\times [ 0,1])$ ] in hausdorff distance . \n then the area of @xmath486 approaches 0 as @xmath388 . \n moreover , @xmath486 covers the graph of @xmath490 for @xmath491 . \n thus @xmath492 hence , there is a point @xmath493 on the graph of @xmath494 such that @xmath495 and @xmath496 the proof of is completed from the fact that , as @xmath494 is concave ( because its inverse function is convex ) , the piecewise linear interpolant of @xmath494 for the family of nodes @xmath497 has a graph below that of @xmath494 . \n the following computer

        "abstract": "This article explores the mathematical properties of generalized sine functions, specifically focusing on their completeness and linear independence within the context of Banach and Hilbert spaces. These functions, which extend the classical sine function, form a Schauder basis under certain conditions and are pivotal in understanding various diffusion processes. Recent advancements in this area involve proving these functions' basis properties using the framework of the generalized eigenvalue problem for the one-dimensional p-Laplacian. The research also delves into the invertibility of the change of coordinates map, crucial for establishing the linear independence of these function sets. Through theoretical and numerical analysis, the study seeks to provide a deeper insight into the structural and functional dynamics of these generalized functions in mathematical physics."

        "abstract": "This article discusses the simulations conducted using COMSOL Multiphysics software to study the Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) response from a silicon carbide (SiC) pillar and substrate system. A unit cell with a single SiC pillar attached to an SiC substrate was modeled under specific boundary conditions. A p-polarized plane wave was used to excite the system, and the nonlinear polarization generated within the SiC structures was analyzed to determine the SHG response. The study varied the fundamental frequency and the periodicity of the pillars to observe the effects on the SHG spectra, revealing a prominent peak corresponding to the excitation of the sphp monopole mode. These results contribute to the understanding of SHG in structured materials and have implications for the design of photonic devices with enhanced nonlinear optical properties."

        "article": "with significant research efforts being directed to the development of neurocomputers based on the functionalities of the brain , a seismic shift is expected in the domain of computing based on the traditional von - neumann model . \n the @xmath0 @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite and the ibm @xmath2 @xcite are instances of recent flagship neuromorphic projects that aim to develop brain - inspired computing platforms suitable for recognition ( image , video , speech ) , classification and mining problems . while boolean computation is based on the sequential fetch , decode and execute cycles , such neuromorphic computing architectures are massively parallel and event - driven and are potentially appealing for pattern recognition tasks and cortical brain simulations \n to that end , researchers have proposed various nanoelectronic devices where the underlying device physics offer a mapping to the neuronal and synaptic operations performed in the brain . the main motivation behind the usage of such non - von neumann post - cmos technologies as neural and synaptic devices stems from the fact that the significant mismatch between the cmos transistors and the underlying neuroscience mechanisms result in significant area and energy overhead for a corresponding hardware implementation . \n a very popular instance is the simulation of a cat s brain on ibm s blue gene supercomputer where the power consumption was reported to be of the order of a few @xmath3 @xcite . \n while the power required to simulate the human brain will rise significantly as we proceed along the hierarchy in the animal kingdom , actual power consumption in the mammalian brain is just a few tens of watts .    in a neuromorphic computing platform \n , synapses form the pathways between neurons and their strength modulate the magnitude of the signal transmitted between the neurons . \n the exact mechanisms that underlie the `` learning '' or `` plasticity '' of such synaptic connections are still under debate . \n meanwhile , researchers have attempted to mimic several plasticity measurements observed in biological synapses in nanoelectronic devices like phase change memories @xcite , @xmath4 memristors @xcite and spintronic devices @xcite , etc . \n however , majority of the research have focused on non - volatile plasticity changes of the synapse in response to the spiking patterns of the neurons it connects corresponding to long - term plasticity @xcite and the volatility of human memory has been largely ignored . as a matter of fact , neuroscience studies performed in @xcite have demonstrated that synapses exhibit an inherent learning ability where they undergo volatile plasticity changes and ultimately undergo long - term plasticity conditionally based on the frequency of the incoming action potentials . \n such volatile or meta - stable synaptic plasticity mechanisms can lead to neuromorphic architectures where the synaptic memory can adapt itself to a changing environment since sections of the memory that have been not receiving frequent stimulus can be now erased and utilized to memorize more frequent information . \n hence , it is necessary to include such volatile memory transition functionalities in a neuromorphic chip in order to leverage from the computational power that such meta - stable synaptic plasticity mechanisms has to offer . \n [ drawing1 ] ( a ) demonstrates the biological process involved in such volatile synaptic plasticity changes . during the transmission of each action potential from the pre - neuron to the post - neuron through the synapse , an influx of ionic species like \n @xmath5 and @xmath6 causes the release of neurotransmitters from the pre- to the post - neuron . \n this results in temporary strengthening of the synaptic strength . \n however , in absence of the action potential , the ionic species concentration settles down to its equilibrium value and the synapse strength diminishes . this phenomenon is termed as short - term plasticity ( stp ) @xcite . however , \n if the action potentials occur frequently , the concentration of the ions do not get enough time to settle down to the equilibrium concentration and this buildup of concentration eventually results in long - term strengthening of the synaptic junction . \n this phenomenon is termed as long - term potentiation ( ltp ) . while stp is a meta - stable state and lasts for a very small time duration \n , ltp is a stable synaptic state which can last for hours , days or even years @xcite . \n a similar discussion is valid for the case where there is a long - term reduction in synaptic strength with frequent stimulus and then the phenomenon is referred to as long - term depression ( ltd ) . \n such stp and ltp mechanisms have been often correlated to the short - term memory ( stm ) and long - term memory ( ltm ) models proposed by atkinson and shiffrin @xcite ( fig . \n [ drawing1](b ) ) . \n this psychological model partitions the human memory into an stm and an ltm . on the arrival of an input stimulus , information is first stored in the stm . however , upon frequent rehearsal , information gets transferred to the ltm . while the `` forgetting '' phenomena occurs at a fast rate in the stm , information can be stored for a much longer duration in the ltm .    in order to mimic such volatile synaptic plasticity mechanisms , a nanoelectronic device is required that is able to undergo meta - stable resistance transitions depending on the frequency of the input and also transition to a long - term stable resistance state on frequent stimulations . \n hence a competition between synaptic memory reinforcement or strengthening and memory loss is a crucial requirement for such nanoelectronic synapses . in the next section \n , we will describe the mapping of the magnetization dynamics of a nanomagnet to such volatile synaptic plasticity mechanisms observed in the brain . \n let us first describe the device structure and principle of operation of an mtj @xcite as shown in fig . \n [ drawing2](a ) . \n the device consists of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a tunneling oxide barrier ( tb ) . \n the magnetization of one of the layers is magnetically `` pinned '' and hence it is termed as the `` pinned '' layer ( pl ) . \n the magnetization of the other layer , denoted as the `` free layer '' ( fl ) , can be manipulated by an incoming spin current @xmath7 . \n the mtj structure exhibits two extreme stable conductive states  the low conductive `` anti - parallel '' orientation ( ap ) , where pl and fl magnetizations are oppositely directed and the high conductive `` parallel '' orientation ( p ) , where the magnetization of the two layers are in the same direction . \n let us consider that the initial state of the mtj synapse is in the low conductive ap state . \n considering the input stimulus ( current ) to flow from terminal t2 to terminal t1 , electrons will flow from terminal t1 to t2 and get spin - polarized by the pl of the mtj . \n subsequently , these spin - polarized electrons will try to orient the fl of the mtj `` parallel '' to the pl . \n it is worth noting here that the spin - polarization of incoming electrons in the mtj is analogous to the release of neurotransmitters in a biological synapse . \n the stp and ltp mechanisms exhibited in the mtj due to the spin - polarization of the incoming electrons can be explained by the energy profile of the fl of the mtj . \n let the angle between the fl magnetization , @xmath8 , and the pl magnetization , @xmath9 , be denoted by @xmath10 . \n the fl energy as a function of @xmath10 has been shown in fig . \n [ drawing2](a ) where the two energy minima points ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) are separated by the energy barrier , @xmath13 . during the transition from the ap state to the p state , the fl has to transition from @xmath12 to @xmath11 . upon the receipt of an input stimulus , the fl magnetization proceeds `` uphill '' along the energy profile ( from initial point 1 to point 2 in fig . \n [ drawing2](a ) ) . \n however , since point 2 is a meta - stable state , it starts going `` downhill '' to point 1 , once the stimulus is removed . \n if the input stimulus is not frequent enough , the fl will try to stabilize back to the ap state after each stimulus . \n however , if the stimulus is frequent , the fl will not get sufficient time to reach point 1 and ultimately will be able to overcome the energy barrier ( point 3 in fig . \n [ drawing2](a ) ) . \n it is worth noting here , that on crossing the energy barrier at @xmath14 , it becomes progressively difficult for the mtj to exhibit stp and switch back to the initial ap state . \n this is in agreement with the psychological model of human memory where it becomes progressively difficult for the memory to `` forget '' information during transition from stm to ltm . \n hence , once it has crossed the energy barrier , it starts transitioning from the stp to the ltp state ( point 4 in fig . \n [ drawing2](a ) ) . \n the stability of the mtj in the ltp state is dictated by the magnitude of the energy barrier . \n the lifetime of the ltp state is exponentially related to the energy barrier @xcite . \n for instance , for an energy barrier of @xmath15 used in this work , the ltp lifetime is @xmath16 hours while the lifetime can be extended to around @xmath17 years by engineering a barrier height of @xmath18 . \n the lifetime can be varied by varying the energy barrier , or equivalently , volume of the mtj . \n the stp - ltp behavior of the mtj can be also explained from the magnetization dynamics of the fl described by landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation with additional term to account for the spin momentum torque according to slonczewski @xcite , @xmath19 where , @xmath20 is the unit vector of fl magnetization , @xmath21 is the gyromagnetic ratio for electron , @xmath22 is gilberts damping ratio , @xmath23 is the effective magnetic field including the shape anisotropy field for elliptic disks calculated using @xcite , @xmath24 is the number of spins in free layer of volume @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is saturation magnetization and @xmath27 is bohr magneton ) , and @xmath28 is the spin current generated by the input stimulus @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the spin - polarization efficiency of the pl ) . thermal noise is included by an additional thermal field @xcite , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation , @xmath33 is boltzmann constant , @xmath34 is the temperature and @xmath35 is the simulation time step . \n equation  [ llg ] can be reformulated by simple algebraic manipulations as , @xmath36 hence , in the presence of an input stimulus the magnetization of the fl starts changing due to integration of the input . however , in the absence of the input , it starts leaking back due to the first two terms in the rhs of the above equation . \n it is worth noting here that , like traditional semiconductor memories , magnitude and duration of the input stimulus will definitely have an impact on the stp - ltp transition of the synapse . \n however , frequency of the input is a critical factor in this scenario . even though the total flux through the device is same , \n the synapse will conditionally change its state if the frequency of the input is high . \n we verified that this functionality is exhibited in mtjs by performing llg simulations ( including thermal noise ) . \n the conductance of the mtj as a function of @xmath10 can be described by , @xmath37 where , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is the mtj conductance in the p ( ap ) orientation respectively . as shown in fig . \n [ drawing2](b ) , the mtj conductance undergoes meta - stable transitions ( stp ) and is not able to undergo ltp when the time interval of the input pulses is large ( @xmath40 ) . \n however , on frequent stimulations with time interval as @xmath41 , the device undergoes ltp transition incrementally . \n [ drawing2](b ) and ( c ) illustrates the competition between memory reinforcement and memory decay in an mtj structure that is crucial to implement stp and ltp in the synapse . \n we demonstrate simulation results to verify the stp and ltp mechanisms in an mtj synapse depending on the time interval between stimulations . \n the device simulation parameters were obtained from experimental measurements @xcite and have been shown in table i.    [ table ]    table i. device simulation parameters    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      +                the mtj was subjected to 10 stimulations , each stimulation being a current pulse of magnitude @xmath42 and @xmath43 in duration . as shown in fig . \n [ drawing3 ] , the probability of ltp transition and average device conductance at the end of each stimulation increases with decrease in the time interval between the stimulations . \n the dependence on stimulation time interval can be further characterized by measurements corresponding to paired - pulse facilitation ( ppf : synaptic plasticity increase when a second stimulus follows a previous similar stimulus ) and post - tetanic potentiation ( ptp : progressive synaptic plasticity increment when a large number of such stimuli are received successively ) @xcite . \n [ drawing4 ] depicts such ppf ( after 2nd stimulus ) and ptp ( after 10th stimulus ) measurements for the mtj synapse with variation in the stimulation interval . \n the measurements closely resemble measurements performed in frog neuromuscular junctions @xcite where ppf measurements revealed that there was a small synaptic conductivity increase when the stimulation rate was frequent enough while ptp measurements indicated ltp transition on frequent stimulations with a fast decay in synaptic conductivity on decrement in the stimulation rate . \n hence , stimulation rate indeed plays a critical role in the mtj synapse to determine the probability of ltp transition . \n the psychological model of stm and ltm utilizing such mtj synapses was further explored in a @xmath44 memory array . \n the array was stimulated by a binary image of the purdue university logo where a set of 5 pulses ( each of magnitude @xmath45 and @xmath46 in duration ) was applied for each on pixel . \n the snapshots of the conductance values of the memory array after each stimulus have been shown for two different stimulation intervals of @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively . \n while the memory array attempts to remember the displayed image right after stimulation , it fails to transition to ltm for the case @xmath49 and the information is eventually lost @xmath50 after stimulation . \n however , information gets transferred to ltm progressively for @xmath51 . \n it is worth noting here , that the same amount of flux is transmitted through the mtj in both cases . \n the simulation not only provides a visual depiction of the temporal evolution of a large array of mtj conductances as a function of stimulus but also provides inspiration for the realization of adaptive neuromorphic systems exploiting the concepts of stm and ltm . \n readers interested in the practical implementation of such arrays of spintronic devices are referred to ref . \n the contributions of this work over state - of - the - art approaches may be summarized as follows . \n this is the first theoretical demonstration of stp and ltp mechanisms in an mtj synapse . \n we demonstrated the mapping of neurotransmitter release in a biological synapse to the spin polarization of electrons in an mtj and performed extensive simulations to illustrate the impact of stimulus frequency on the ltp probability in such an mtj structure . \n there have been recent proposals of other emerging devices that can exhibit such stp - ltp mechanisms like @xmath52 synapses @xcite and @xmath53 memristors @xcite . \n however , it is worth noting here , that input stimulus magnitudes are usually in the range of volts ( 1.3v in @xcite and 80mv in @xcite ) and stimulus durations are of the order of a few msecs ( 1ms in @xcite and 0.5s in @xcite ) . \n in contrast , similar mechanisms can be exhibited in mtj synapses at much lower energy consumption ( by stimulus magnitudes of a few hundred @xmath54 and duration of a few @xmath55 ) . \n we believe that this work will stimulate proof - of - concept experiments to realize such mtj synapses that can potentially pave the way for future ultra - low power intelligent neuromorphic systems capable of adaptive learning . \n the work was supported in part by , center for spintronic materials , interfaces , and novel architectures ( c -

        "abstract": "This article explores the advancements in neuromorphic computing, a field aimed at emulating the brain's architecture to enhance computing processes such as pattern recognition and data mining. Traditional computing, based on the von Neumann architecture, operates sequentially, while neuromorphic computing utilizes parallel and event-driven architectures, potentially improving efficiency in simulating neural activities. The focus is on the development of non-volatile and volatile synaptic devices like memristors and spintronic devices, which mimic the brain's synaptic mechanisms. Key examples include the simulation of a cat's brain using IBM's Blue Gene supercomputer, highlighting the significant power consumption compared to the human brain. The article discusses the role of synaptic plasticity in neuromorphic computing, emphasizing the need for devices capable of both short-term and long-term plasticity to mimic human memory dynamics effectively."

        "article": "the segmentation process as a whole can be thought of as consisting of two tasks : recognition and delineation . \n recognition is to determine roughly `` where '' the object is and to distinguish it from other object - like entities . \n although delineation is the final step for defining the spatial extent of the object region / boundary in the image , an efficient recognition strategy is a key for successful delineation . in this study , \n a novel , general method is introduced for object recognition to assist in segmentation ( delineation ) tasks . \n it exploits the pose relationship that can be encoded , via the concept of ball scale ( b - scale )  @xcite , between the binary training objects and their associated images .    as an alternative to the manual methods based on initial placement of the models by an expert  @xcite in the literature , \n model based methods can be employed for recognition . \n for example , in @xcite , the position of an organ model ( such as liver ) is estimated by its histogram . in  @xcite , \n generalized hough transform is succesfully extended to incorporate variability of shape for 2d segmentation problem . \n atlas based methods are also used to define initial position for a shape model . in  @xcite \n , affine registration is performed to align the data into an atlas to determine the initial position for a shape model of the knee cartilage . \n similarly , a popular particle filtering algorithm is used to detect the starting pose of models for both single and multi - object cases  @xcite . however , due to the large search space and numerous local minimas in most of these studies , conducting a global search on the entire image is not a feasible approach . in this paper \n , we investigate an approach of automatically recognizing objects in 3d images without performing elaborate searches or optimization . \n the proposed method consists of the following key ideas and components :    * 1 . \n model building : * after aligning image data from all @xmath0 subjects in the training set into a common coordinate system via 7-parameter affine registration , the live - wire algorithm  @xcite is used to segment @xmath1 different objects from @xmath0 subjects . \n segmented objects are used for the automatic extraction of landmarks in a slice - by - slice manner  @xcite . from the landmark information for all objects , \n a model assembly @xmath2 is constructed . \n b - scale encoding : * the b - scale value at every voxel in an image helps to understand `` objectness '' of a given image without doing explicit segmentation . for each voxel , \n the radius of the largest ball of homogeneous intensity is weighted by the intensity value of that particular voxel in order to incorporate appearance ( texture ) information into the object information ( called intensity weighted b - scale : @xmath3 ) so that a model of the correlations between shape and texture can be built . a simple and proper way of thresholding the b - scale image yields a few largest balls remaining in the image . \n these are used for the construction of the relationship between the segmented training objects and the corresponding images . \n the resulting images have a strong relationship with the actual delineated objects . \n relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath3 : * a principal component @xmath4 system is built via pca for the segmented objects in each image , and their mean @xmath5 system , denoted @xmath6 , is found over all training images . \n @xmath6 has an origin and three @xmath5 axes . \n similarly the mean @xmath5 system , denoted @xmath7 , for intensity weighted b - scale images @xmath8 is found . \n finally the transformation @xmath9 that maps @xmath7 to @xmath6 is found . \n given an image @xmath10 to be segmented , the main idea here is to use @xmath9 to facilitate a quick placement of @xmath2 in @xmath10 with a proper pose as indicated in step 4 below .    * \n hierarchical recognition : * for a given image @xmath10 , @xmath3 is obtained and its @xmath5 system , denoted @xmath11 is computed subsequently . assuming the relationship of @xmath11 to @xmath6 to be the same as of @xmath7 to @xmath6 , and assuming that @xmath6 offers the proper pose of @xmath2 in the training images , we use transformation @xmath9 and @xmath11 to determine the pose of @xmath2 in @xmath10 . \n this level of recognition is called coarse recognition . further refinement of the recognition can be done using the skin boundary object in the image with the requirement that a major portion of @xmath2 should lie inside the body region delimited by the skin boundary . moreover \n , a little search inside the skin boundary can be done for the fine tuning , however , since offered coarse recognition method gives high recognition rates , there is no need to do any elaborate searches . \n we will focus on the fine tuning of coarse recognition for future study . \n the finest level of recognition requires the actual delineation algorithm itself , which is a hybrid method in our case and called gc - asm ( synergistic integration of graph - cut and active shape model ) . \n this delineation algorithm is presented in a companion paper submitted to this symposium  @xcite . \n a convenient way of achieving incorporation of prior information automatically in computing systems is to create and use a flexible _ model _ to encode information such as the expected _ size _ , _ shape _ , _ appearance _ , and _ position _ of objects in an image  @xcite . among such information , \n _ shape _ and _ appearance _ are two complementary but closely related attributes of biological structures in images , and hence they are often used to create statistical models . in particular , shape has been used both in high and low level image analysis tasks extensively , and it has been demonstrated that shape models ( such as active shape models ( asms ) ) can be quite powerful in compensating for misleading information due to noise , poor resolution , clutter , and occlusion in the images  @xcite . \n therefore , we use asm  @xcite to estimate population statistics from a set of examples ( training set ) . in order to guarantee 3d point correspondences required by asm \n , we build our statistical shape models combining semi - automatic methods : ( 1 ) manually selected anatomically correspondent slices by an expert , and ( 2 ) semi - automatic way of specifying key points on the shapes starting from the same anatomical locations . \n once step ( 1 ) is accomplished , the remaining problem turns into a problem of establishing point correspondence in 2d shapes , which is easily solved . \n it is extremely significant to choose correct correspondences so that a good representation of the modelled object results . \n although landmark correspondence is usually established manually by experts , it is time - consuming , prone to errors , and restricted to only 2d objects  @xcite . \n because of these limitations , a semi - automatic landmark tagging method , _ equal space landmarking _ , is used to establish correspondence between landmarks of each sample shape in our experiments . \n although this method is proposed for 2d objects , and equally spacing a fixed number of points for 3d objects is much more difficult , we use equal space landmarking technique in pseudo-3d manner where 3d object is annotated slice by slice . \n let @xmath12 be a single shape and assume that its finite dimensional representation after the landmarking consisting of @xmath13 landmark points with positions @xmath14 , where @xmath15 are cartesian coordinates of the @xmath16 point on the shape @xmath17 . \n equal space landmark tagging for points @xmath18 for @xmath19 on shape boundaries ( contours ) starts by selecting an initial point on each shape sample in training set and equally space a fixed number of points on each boundary automatically  @xcite . selecting the starting point \n has been done manually by annotating the same anatomical point for each shape in the training set . \n figure  [ img : landmarking_abd ] shows annotated landmarks for five different objects ( skin , liver , right kidney , left kidney , spleen ) in a ct slice of the abdominal region . \n note that different number of landmarks are used for different objects considering their size .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ] \n \\(1 ) the b - scale image of a given image captures object morphometric information without requiring explicit segmentation . \n b - scales constitute fundamental units of an image in terms of largest homogeneous balls situated at every voxel in the image . \n the b - scale concept has been previously used in object delineation , filtering and registration . \n our results suggest that their ability to capture object geography in conjunction with shape models may be useful in quick and simple yet accurate object recognition strategies . \n ( 2 ) the presented method is general and does not depend on exploiting the peculiar characteristics of the application situation . \n ( 3 ) the specificity of recognition increases dramatically as the number of objects in the model increases . \n ( 4 ) we emphasize that both modeling and testing procedures are carried out on the ct data sets that are part of the clinical pet / ct data routinely acquired in our hospital . \n the ct data set are thus of relatively poor ( spatial and contrast ) resolution compared to other ct - alone studies with or without contrast . \n we expect better performance if higher resolution ct data are employed in modeling or testing . \n this paper is published in spie medical imaging conference - 2010 . \n falcao , a.x . , \n udupa , j.k . , \n samarasekera , s. , sharma , s. , hirsch , b.e . , and lotufo , r.a . , 1998 \n user - steered image segmentation paradigms : live wire and live lane . graph . \n models image process . \n 60  ( 4 ) , pp . \n 233260 . \n kokkinos , i. , maragos , p. , 2009 . \n synergy between object recognition and image segmentation using the expectation - maximization algorithm . \n ieee transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligience , vol.31  ( 8) , pp.14861501 . \n brejl , m. , sonka , m. , 2000 . \n object localization and border detection criteria design in edge - based image segmentation : automated learning from examples . \n ieee transactions on medical imaging , vol.19  ( 10 ) , pp.973985 . \n fripp , j. , crozier , s. , warfield , s.k . , \n ourselin , s. , 2005 . \n automatic initialisation of 3d deformable models for cartilage segmentation . in proceedings of digital image computing : techniques and applications , pp .",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel method for object recognition aimed at enhancing the segmentation process in 3D images. The method leverages a combination of semi-automatic shape modeling and the concept of ball scale (B-scale) to encode pose relationships between training objects and their images. By utilizing a hierarchical recognition strategy that places shape models in close proximity to the correct pose without extensive searching or optimization, the method significantly streamlines the recognition and delineation tasks. The approach uses multi-object shape models, intensity-weighted B-scale images, and a principal component system to automatically position models within new images based on learned pose relationships. This method promises to improve object recognition accuracy, particularly in complex medical imaging tasks such as CT scans, by simplifying the initial placement and adjustment of models relative to target object boundaries."

        "article": "one surprising result that has come out of the more than 200 extrasolar planet discoveries to date is the wide range of eccentricities observed . unlike our own solar system \n , many of the extrasolar planets which are not tidally locked to their host stars have moderate eccentricities ( @xmath1 ) , and 15 planets have high eccentricities ( @xmath0 ) . \n these observations have spawned several theories as to the origin of highly eccentric extrasolar planets . \n one such method , planet - planet scattering , occurs when multiple jovian planets form several astronomical units ( au ) from the host star and then interact , leaving one in an eccentric orbit and often ejecting the other @xcite . \n this method has been proposed to explain the architecture of the @xmath2 and planetary system @xcite , which contains a hot jupiter as well as two jovian planets in moderately eccentric orbits . \n @xcite suggested a merger scenario in which inner protoplanets perturb each other and merge to form a single massive , eccentric planet with @xmath3 and @xmath4 au . \n interactions with stellar companions are another possible way to boost a planet s eccentricity . \n of the 15 stars hosting a planet with @xmath0 , six are also known to possess stellar - mass companions in wide binary orbits : hd  3651 @xcite , hd  20782 @xcite , hd  80606 , hd  89744 @xcite , 16  cyg  b , and hd  222582 @xcite . \n if the inclination angle between the planetary orbit and a stellar companion is large , the kozai mechanism @xcite can induce large - amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of the planet ( e.g.  malmberg et al . \n these oscillations can be damped by general relativistic effects and by interaction with other planets , and hence are most effective in systems with a single planet in an orbit @xmath51  au from the host star @xcite . \n the kozai mechanism has been suggested to explain the high eccentricity of 16  cyg  bb @xcite and hd  80606b @xcite . \n @xcite found the inclination of 16  cyg  b orbiting the system barycenter to lie between 100 and 160 degrees , where 90 degrees is an edge - on orientation . \n however , it is the difference in inclination between the orbital planes of the planetary and stellar companion that is critical in determining the importance of the kozai mechanism , and the inclination of the planet s orbit is generally not known for non - transiting systems .    of the 192 known planetary systems , 23 ( 12% ) \n are multi - planet systems . \n recent discoveries of additional objects in systems known to host at least one planet @xcite suggest that multiple - planet systems are common . \n of particular interest are systems which host a jovian planet and a low - mass `` hot neptune , '' e.g.  55  cnc ( = hd  75732 ) , gj  876 , @xmath6 arae ( = hd  160691 ) , gl  777a ( = hd  190360 ) . motivated by the discoveries of hot neptunes in known planetary systems , we have undertaken an intensive survey of selected single - planet systems to search for additional low - mass companions . \n three of the planetary systems discussed in this paper ( hd  3651 , hd  80606 , hd  89744 ) are part of this campaign . \n the excellent radial - velocity precision of the high resolution spectrograph on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) , combined with queue - scheduling , allow us to time the observations in such a way as to minimize phase gaps in the orbit of the known planet , and also to act quickly on potential new planet candidates . \n the use of the het in this manner is discussed further in @xcite with regard to the discovery of hd  37605b .    in this work \n , we aim to combine observational limits on additional planets in known planetary systems with dynamical constraints obtained by n - body simulations . \n the observations address the question : what additional planets are ( or are not ) in these systems ? \n the dynamical simulations can answer the question : where are additional planets possible ? \n section  2 describes the observations and the test particle simulations for six highly eccentric planetary systems : hd  3651 , hd  37605 , hd  45350 , hd  80606 , hd  89744 , and 16 \n cyg  b. we have chosen these systems based on two criteria : ( 1 ) each hosts a planet with @xmath0 , and ( 2 ) each has been observed by the planet search programs at mcdonald observatory . in  3 , we present and discuss the results of the updated orbital fits , dynamical simulations , and detection limit computations . \n five of the six stars considered in this work have been observed with the mcdonald observatory 9.2  m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) using its high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) @xcite . \n a full description of the het planet search program is given in @xcite . \n for 16  cyg  b , observations from mcdonald observatory were obtained only with the 2.7  m harlan j.  smith ( hjs ) telescope ; the long - term planet search program on this telescope is described in @xcite . \n all available published data on these systems were combined with our data from mcdonald observatory in the orbit fitting procedures .      to place constraints on the architecture of planetary systems , we would like to know where additional objects can remain in stable orbits in the presence of the known planet(s ) . \n we performed test particle simulations using swifthal / swift.html . ] \n @xcite to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low - mass planets in each of the six systems considered here . \n low - mass planets can be treated as test particles since the exchange of angular momentum with jovian planets is small . \n we chose the regularized mixed - variable symplectic integrator ( rmvs3 ) version of swift for its ability to handle close approaches between massless , non - interacting test particles and planets . \n particles are removed if they are ( 1 ) closer than 1 hill radius to the planet , ( 2 ) closer than 0.05  au to the star , or ( 3 ) farther than 10  au from the star . \n since the purpose of these simulations is to determine the regions in which additional planets could remain in stable orbits , we set this outer boundary because the current repository of radial - velocity data can not detect objects at such distances . \n the test particle simulations were set up following the methods used in @xcite , with the exception that only initially circular orbits are considered in this work . for each planetary system , \n test particles were placed in initially circular orbits spaced every 0.002  au in the region between 0.05 - 2.0  au . \n we have chosen to focus on this region because the duration of our high - precision het data is currently only 2 - 4 years for the objects in this study . \n the test particles were coplanar with the existing planet , which had the effect of confining the simulation to two dimensions . \n input physical parameters for the known planet in each system were obtained from our keplerian orbit fits described in   3.1 , and from recent literature for 16  cyg  b @xcite and hd  45350 @xcite . \n the planetary masses were taken to be their minimum values ( sin  @xmath7 ) . \n the systems were integrated for @xmath8 yr , following @xcite and allowing completion of the computations in a reasonable time . \n we observed that nearly all of the test - particle removals occurred within the first @xmath9 yr ; after this time , the simulations had essentially stabilized to their final configurations . \n we present updated keplerian orbital solutions for hd  3651b , hd  37605b , hd  80606b , and hd  89744b in table  1 . \n a summary of the data used in our analysis is given in table  2 , and the het radial velocities are given in tables  3 - 6 . \n the velocity uncertainties given for the het data represent internal errors only , and do not include any external sources of error such as stellar `` jitter . '' \n the parameters for the remaining two planets , hd  45350b and 16  cyg  bb , are taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively . \n radial velocity measurements from the het are given for hd  45350 in @xcite , and velocities for 16  cyg  b from the hjs telescope are given in @xcite . \n as in @xcite , all available published data were combined with those from mcdonald , and the known planet in each system was fit with a keplerian orbit using gaussfit @xcite , allowing the velocity offset between each data set to be a free parameter . \n examination of the residuals to our keplerian orbit fits revealed no evidence for additional objects in any of the six systems in this study . \n the saturn - mass ( m  sin  @xmath10 ) planet hd  3651b was discovered by @xcite using observations from lick and keck . \n we fit these data , which were updated in @xcite , in combination with observations from the hjs and het at mcdonald observatory . \n the het data , which consist of multiple exposures per visit , were binned using the inverse - variance weighted mean value of the velocities in each visit . \n the standard error of the mean was added in quadrature to the weighted rms about the mean velocity to generate the error bar of each binned point ( n=29 ) . \n the rms about the combined fit for each dataset is : lick & keck6.6 , het9.4 , hjs12.2 . \n the fitted orbital parameters for hd  3651b are of comparable precision to those reported in @xcite , and agree within 2@xmath11 . \n the recent discovery of a t dwarf companion to hd  3651 @xcite prompts an interesting exercise : can the radial - velocity trend due to this object be detected in the residuals after removing the planet ? \n we detect a slope of @xmath12  yr@xmath13 , indicating that we are indeed able to discern a trend which is possibly due to the binary companion . \n however , the reduced @xmath14 of the orbital solution is not significantly improved by the inclusion of a linear trend ( @xmath15=0.18 ) . \n the parameters given in table  1 were obtained from the fit which did not include a trend . \n we present 23 new het observations for hd  37605 obtained since its announcement by @xcite . \n the data now span a total of 1065  days . \n the best fit is obtained by including an acceleration of @xmath16  yr@xmath13 , indicating a distant orbiting body . \n such a finding would lend support to the hypothesis that very eccentric single - planet systems originate by interactions within a wide binary system . \n the shortest period that this outer companion could have and still remain consistent with the observed acceleration and its uncertainty over the timespan of the observations is about 40  yr , assuming a circular orbit . \n this object would then have a minimum mass in the brown dwarf range \n .    the planet orbiting hd  80606 , first announced by @xcite , is the most eccentric extrasolar planet known , with @xmath17 ( table  1 ) . \n we have fit the coralie data in combination with the keck data given in @xcite and 23 observations from het . \n the extreme velocity variations induced by this planet greatly increase the sensitivity of orbit fits to the weighting of individual measurements . since the uncertainties of the het velocities given in tables  3 - 6 represent internal errors only , we experimented with adding 1 - 7 of radial - velocity `` jitter '' in quadrature before fitting the data for hd  80606 . \n for all of these jitter values , the fitted parameters remained the same within their uncertainties . \n table  1 gives the parameters derived from a fit which added 3.5  of jitter @xcite to the het data . \n the rms about the combined fit is : coralie18.7 , het7.5 , keck5.6 . \n @xcite noted that the eccentricity @xmath18 and the argument of periastron @xmath19 had to be held fixed in their fit to the keck data alone . \n however , the large number of measurements included in this work allowed gaussfit to converge with all parameters free .    for hd  89744b , we combine data from the het with 6 measurements from the hjs telescope and lick data from @xcite . \n the het data were binned in the same manner as for hd  3651 , resulting in n=33 independent visits . \n the rms about the combined fit for each dataset is : lick17.1 , het10.7 , hjs9.5 . as with hd  3651b , \n our derived parameters agree with those of @xcite within 2@xmath11 . \n the scatter about our fit remains large , most likely due to the star s early spectral type ( f7v ) , which hinders precision radial - velocity measurements due to the smaller number of spectral lines . \n for example , the f7v star hd  221287 was recently found to host a planet @xcite ; despite the superb instrumental precision of the harps spectrograph , that orbital solution has a residual rms of 8.5 . \n the results of the dynamical simulations are shown in figures  1 - 3 . \n the survival time of the test particles is plotted against their initial semimajor axis . \n as shown in figure  1 , the short - period planets hd  3651 and hd  37605 sweep clean the region inside of about 0.5  au . in both of these systems , however , a small number of test particles remained in low - eccentricity orbits near the known planet s apastron distance , near the 1:2 mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) . in the hd  3651 system , particles remained stable beyond about 0.6  au , which is not surprising given the low mass of the planet . for hd  37605 , \n two distinct strips of stability are seen in fig .  1 , corresponding to the 1:2 and 1:3 mmrs . \n the eccentricity of the test particles in the region of the 1:2 mmr oscillated between 0.00 and 0.06 . \n particles in 1:3 mmr oscillated in eccentricity with a larger range , up to @xmath20 , which is expected due to secular forcing . as with hd  3651 , the region beyond about 0.8  au \n was essentially unaffected by the planet . \n figure  2 shows the results for the hd  45350 and hd  80606 systems . \n the long period ( 963.6 days ) and relatively large mass ( m  sin  @xmath21=1.8 ) of hd  45350b restricted stable orbits to the innermost 0.2  au . \n these test particles oscillated in eccentricity up to @xmath22 . \n the 4  planet orbiting hd  80606 removed all test particles to a distance of about 1.5  au , and only beyond 1.75  au did test particles remain in stable orbits for the duration of the simulation ( @xmath8 yr ) . \n a region of instability is evident at 1.9  au due to the 8:1 mmr . \n figure  3 shows that hd  89744b eliminated all test particles except for a narrow region near the 8:3 resonance . \n for the 16  cyg  b system , only particles inside of about 0.3  au remained stable , leaving open the possibility of short - period planets . \n the surviving particles oscillated in eccentricity up to @xmath23 , but these simulations treat the star as a point mass , and hence tidal damping of the eccentricity is not included \n . our results are consistent with those of @xcite , who investigated dynamical stability in extrasolar planetary systems and found that no test particles survived in the habitable zones of the hd  80606 , hd  89744 , and 16  cyg  b systems . \n three of these systems ( hd  3651 , hd  80606 , hd  89744 ) were monitored intensely with the het as part of a larger effort to search for low - mass , short period planets . \n no evidence was found for any such objects in these or any of the six systems in this work . \n we then asked what limits can be set on additional planets using the high - precision het data we have obtained . \n the procedure for determining companion limits was identical to the method described in @xcite , except that in this work , the best - fit keplerian orbit for the known planet ( see   3.1 ) was removed before performing the limits computations . in this way \n , we determined the radial - velocity amplitude @xmath24 for which 99% of planets would have been detected in the residuals . \n the eccentricity of the injected test signals was chosen to be the mean eccentricity of the surviving particles from the simulations described in   3.2 . only the regions in which test particles survived were considered in these limits computations . \n the results of these computations were highly varied , reflecting the differing observing strategies employed for these six objects . \n in particular , hd  3651 , hd  80606 , and hd  89744 were monitored intensely with the het as part of a search for short - period objects , whereas hd  37605 and hd  45350 were only observed sporadically after the known planet orbits were defined and published @xcite , and 16  cyg  b has only been observed with the hjs telescope at a frequency of at most once per month . \n the companion limits are shown in figures  4 - 6 ; planets with masses above the solid line can be ruled out by the data with 99% confidence . \n not surprisingly , the tightest limits were obtained for hd  3651 ( figure  4 ) , which had a total of 195 measurements , including 29 independent het visits . \n for periods less than about 1  year , we can exclude planets with m  sin  @xmath21  2 neptune masses . \n similar results were obtained for 16  cyg  b ( n=161 ) , where the limits approach a neptune mass ( figure  6 ) . \n since the detection limits generally improve with the addition of more data and with higher - quality data , we can define a quantity to measure the goodness of the limits . \n a simple choice would be @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the total number of observations , and @xmath27 is the mean uncertainty of the radial - velocity measurements . \n the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are given in table  2 .    in the hd  45350 system , the results of the dynamical simulations complement those of the detection limit determinations . \n very tight limits are obtained in close orbits ( @xmath280.2  au ) . in this region , \n test particles were stable ( fig .  2 ) and our observations can exclude planets with m  sin  _ i _ between about 1 and 4 neptune masses . \n similar results were obtained for the 16  cyg  b system , in which test particles remained stable inward of @xmath29  0.3  au . in that region , \n planets of 1 - 3 neptune masses can be excluded by our limits determinations ( fig . \n 6 ) . in most of the limits determinations \n , there are multiple `` blind spots '' evident where the periodogram method failed to significantly recover the injected signals . \n typically this occurs at certain trial periods for which the phase coverage of the observational data is poor , and often at the 1-month and 1-year windows .    for none of hd  37605 ( fig .  4 ) , hd  80606 ( fig .  5 ) , or hd  89744 ( fig . \n 6 ) could additional companions be ruled out below about 0.7 , and for most orbital periods tested , the limits were substantially worse . \n one possible explanation for this result is that the sampling of the observations was poorly distributed in phase for many of the injected test signals , making significant recovery by the periodogram method difficult . \n this is evidenced by the `` jagged '' regions in the plots . \n also , the intrinsic scatter for those three systems was too large to permit tight limits determination . \n this is certainly reasonable for the f7 star hd  89744 . \n the three systems with the best limits ( hd  3651 , hd  45350 , and 16  cyg  b ) also had the lowest rms scatter about their orbital solutions ( mean=@xmath30 ; table  1 ) . \n in contrast , the mean rms for the remaining three systems was @xmath31 . \n additional factors such as a paucity of data ( hd  37605 ) and short time baselines ( hd  80606 , hd  89744 ) made the determination of useful companion limits challenging for some of the planetary systems in this study . \n we have shown that for a sample of six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems , there is no evidence for additional planets . \n test particle simulations show that there are regions detectable by current surveys ( i.e.  for @xmath32 au ) where additional objects can exist . for hd  3651 and hd  37605 \n , we find that protected resonances are also present . \n combining these simulations with detection limits computed using new high - precision het data combined with all available published data is particularly effective for the hd  3651 and hd  45350 systems . \n additional short - period planets can be ruled out down to a few neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions in these systems . \n this material is based upon work supported by the

        "abstract": "This paper examines the high eccentricities observed in over 200 extrasolar planets, which contrast with the lower eccentricities seen in our solar system. It discusses several theories for the origins of these eccentric orbits, particularly focusing on planet-planet scattering and interactions with stellar companions, such as the Kozai mechanism. The study uses data from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and McDonald Observatory to investigate the architecture of specific planetary systems with high eccentricities. It combines observations and dynamical simulations to explore the stability and potential for additional planets in these systems. The paper details the methodology and results of test particle simulations that identify stable regions where low-mass planets could exist, alongside radial-velocity measurements to place constraints on the presence of such planets. The findings contribute to our understanding of planetary system formation and the dynamic processes that influence the orbital characteristics of exoplanets."

        "article": "biological aggregations such as fish schools , bird flocks , bacterial colonies , and insect swarms @xcite have characteristic morphologies governed by the group members interactions with each other and with their environment . \n the _ endogenous _ interactions , _ \n i.e. _ , those between individuals , often involve organisms reacting to each other in an attractive or repulsive manner @xcite when they sense each other either directly by sound , sight , smell or touch , or indirectly via chemicals , vibrations , or other signals . \n a typical modeling strategy is to treat each individual as a moving particle whose velocity is influenced by social ( interparticle ) attractive and repulsive forces @xcite . in contrast , the _ exogenous _ forces describe an individual s reaction to the environment , for instance a response to gravity , wind , a chemical source , a light source , a food source , or a predator . \n the superposition of endogenous and exogenous forces can lead to characteristic swarm shapes ; these equilibrium solutions are the subject of our present study . \n more specifically , our motivation is rooted in our previous modeling study of the swarming desert locust _ \n schistocerca gregaria _ @xcite . in some parameter regimes of our model ( \n presented momentarily ) , locusts self - organize into swarms with a peculiar morphology , namely a bubble - like shape containing a dense group of locusts on the ground and a flying group of locusts overhead ; see figure [ fig : locust](bc ) . \n the two are separated by an unoccupied gap . with wind \n , the swarm migrates with a rolling motion . \n locusts at the front of the swarm fly downwards and land on the ground . \n locusts on the ground , when overtaken by the flying swarm , take off and rejoin the flying group ; see figure [ fig : locust](cd ) . \n the presence of an unoccupied gap and the rolling motion are found in real locust swarms  @xcite . as we will show throughout this paper , features of swarms such as dense concentrations and disconnected components ( that is , the presence of gaps ) arise as properties of equilibria in a general model of swarming . \n the model of @xcite is    [ eq : locusts ] @xmath1    which describes @xmath2 interacting locusts with positions @xmath3 . \n the direction of locust swarm migration is strongly correlated with the direction of the wind @xcite and has little macroscopic motion in the transverse direction , so the model is two - dimensional , _ \n i.e. _ , @xmath4 where the @xmath5 coordinate is aligned with the main current of the wind and @xmath6 is a vertical coordinate . as the velocity of each insect is simply a function of position , \n the model neglects inertial forces . \n this so - called kinematic assumption is common in swarming models , and we discuss it further in section [ sec : discretemodel ] . \n the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : locusts ] ) describes endogenous forces ; @xmath7 measures the force that locust @xmath8 exerts on locust @xmath9 . \n the first term of @xmath7 describes attraction , which operates with strength @xmath10 over a length scale @xmath11 and is necessary for aggregation . \n the second term is repulsive , and operates more strongly and over a shorter length scale in order to prevent collisions . \n time and space are scaled so that the repulsive strength and length scale are unity . \n the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : locusts ] ) describes gravity , acting downwards with strength @xmath12 . \n the last term describes advection of locusts in the direction of the wind with speed @xmath13 . \n furthermore , the model assumes a flat impenetrable ground . since locusts rest and feed while grounded , their motion in that state is negligible compared to their motion in the air . \n thus we add to ( [ eq : locusts ] ) the stipulation that grounded locusts whose vertical velocity is computed to be negative under ( [ eq : locusts ] ) remain stationary . \n as mentioned above , for some parameters , ( [ eq : locusts ] ) forms a bubble - like shape . \n this can occur even in the absence of wind , that is , when @xmath14 ; see figure [ fig : locust](b ) . \n the bubble is crucial , for it allows the swarm to roll in the presence of wind . as discussed in @xcite , states which lack a bubble in the absence of wind do not migrate in the presence of wind . \n conditions for bubble formation , even in the equilibrium state arising in the windless model , have not been determined ; we will investigate this problem . \n some swarming models adopt a discrete approach  as in our locust example above  because of the ready connection to biological observations . \n a further advantage is that simulation of discrete systems is straightforward , requiring only the integration of ordinary differential equations . \n however , since biological swarms contain many individuals , the resulting high - dimensional systems of differential equations can be difficult or impossible to analyze . \n furthermore , for especially large systems , computation , though straightforward , may become a bottleneck . \n continuum models are more amenable to analysis . \n one well - studied continuum model is that of @xcite , a partial integrodifferential equation model for a swarm population density @xmath15 in one spatial dimension : @xmath16 the density @xmath17 obeys a conservation equation , and @xmath18 is the velocity field , which is determined via convolution with the antisymmetric pairwise endogenous force @xmath19 , the one - dimensional analog of a social force like the one in ( [ eq : locusts ] ) . \n the general model ( [ eq : introeq ] ) displays at least three solution types as identified in  @xcite . \n populations may concentrate to a point , reach a finite steady state , or spread . in  @xcite , we identified conditions on the social interaction force @xmath19 for each behavior to occur . \n these conditions map out a `` phase diagram '' dividing parameter space into regions associated with each behavior . \n similar phase diagrams arise in a dynamic particle model @xcite and its continuum analog @xcite . \n models that break the antisymmetry of @xmath19 ( creating an asymmetric response of organisms to each other ) display more complicated phenomena , including traveling swarms @xcite . \n many studies have sought conditions under which the population concentrates to a point mass . in a one - dimensional domain , \n collapse occurs when the force @xmath19 is finite and attractive at short distances @xcite . \n the analogous condition in higher dimensions also leads to collapse @xcite . \n one may also consider the case when the velocity includes an additional term describing an exogenous force , @xmath20 in this case , equilibrium solutions consisting of sums of point - masses can be linearly and nonlinearly stable , even for social forces @xmath19 that are repulsive at short distances @xcite . \n these results naturally lead to the question of whether a solution can be continued past the time at which a mass concentrates . early work on a particular generalization of ( [ eq : introeq ] ) \n suggests the answer is yes @xcite . for ( [ eq : introeq ] ) itself in arbitrary dimension \n , there is an existence theory beyond the time of concentration @xcite . \n some of the concentration solutions mentioned above are equilibrium solutions \n . however , there may be classical equilibria as well . \n for most purely attractive @xmath19 , the only classical steady states are constant in space , as shown via a variational formulation of the steady state problem @xcite \n . however , these solutions are non - biological , as they contain infinite mass . there \n do exist attractive - repulsive @xmath19 which give rise to compactly - supported classical steady states of finite mass . \n for instance , in simulations of ( [ eq : introeq ] ) , we found classical steady state solutions consisting of compactly supported swarms with jump discontinuities at the edges of the support @xcite . in our current work , we will find equilibria that contain both classical and nonclassical components . \n many of the results reviewed above were obtained by exploiting the underlying gradient flow structure of ( [ eq : introeq2 ] ) . \n there exists an energy functional @xmath21 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_\\mathbb{r } \\int_\\mathbb{r } \\rho(x ) \\rho(y ) q(x - y)\\,dx\\,dy + \\int_\\mathbb{r } f(x)\\rho(x)\\,dx,\\ ] ] which is minimized under the dynamics . \n this energy can be interpreted as the continuum analog of the summed pairwise energy of the corresponding discrete ( particle ) model @xcite . \n we will also exploit this energy to find equilibrium solutions and study their stability .    in this paper \n , we focus on equilibria of swarms and ask the following questions :    * what sorts of density distributions do swarming systems make ? are they classical or nonclassical ? * how are the final density distributions reached affected by endogenous interactions , exogenous forces , boundaries , and the interplay of these ? * \n how well can discrete and continuum swarming systems approximate each other ?    to answer these questions , we formulate a general mathematical framework for discrete , interacting swarm members in one spatial dimension , also subject to exogenous forces . \n we then derive an analogous continuum model and use variational methods to seek minimizers of its energy . \n this process involves solution of a fredholm integral equation for the density . \n for some choices of endogenous forces , we are able to find exact solutions . perhaps surprisingly , they are not always classical . in particular , they can involve @xmath0-function concentrations of mass at the domain boundary . \n the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section \n [ sec : formulation ] , we create the mathematical framework for our study , and derive conditions for a particular density distribution to be an equilibrium solution , and to be stable to various classes of perturbations .    in sections [ sec : repulsive ] and [ sec : morse ] , \n we demonstrate different types of swarm equilibria via examples . in section \n [ sec : repulsive ] , we focus on purely repulsive endogenous interactions . \n we consider a bounded domain with no exogenous forces , a half - line subject to gravitational forces , and an unbounded domain subject to a quadratic exogenous potential , modeling attraction to a light , chemical , or nutrient source . \n for all three situations , we find exact solutions for swarm equilibria . \n for the first two examples , these equilibria consist of a density distribution that is classical in the interior of the domain , but contains @xmath0-functions at the boundaries . for the third example , the equilibrium is compactly supported with the density dropping discontinuously to zero at the edge of the support . \n for all three examples , we compare analytical solutions from the continuum framework to equilibria obtained from numerical simulation of the underlying discrete system . the two agree closely even for small numbers of discrete swarm members . \n section [ sec : morse ] is similar to section [ sec : repulsive ] , but we now consider the more complicated case of endogenous interactions that are repulsive on short length scales and attractive over longer ones ; such forces are typical for swarming biological organisms .    in section [ sec : locust - ground ] , we revisit locust swarms , focusing on their bubble - like morphology as described above , and on the significance of dimensionality . in a one - dimensional model corresponding to a vertical slice of a wide locust swarm under the influence of social interactions and gravity , \n energy minimizers can reproduce concentrations of locusts on the ground and a group of locusts above the ground , but there can not be a separation between the two groups \n . however , a quasi - two - dimensional model accounting for the influence of the swarm s horizontal extent does , in contrast , have minimizers which qualitatively correspond to the biological bubble - like swarms . \n consider @xmath2 identical interacting particles ( swarm members ) in one spatial dimension with positions @xmath22 . \n assume that motion is governed by newton s law , so that acceleration is proportional to the sum of the drag and motive forces . \n we will focus on the case where the acceleration is negligible and the drag force is proportional to the velocity . \n this assumption is appropriate when drag forces dominate momentum , commonly known in fluid dynamics as the low reynolds number or stokes flow regime . in the swarming literature , the resulting models , which are first - order in time , are known as _ \n kinematic models have been used in numerous studies of swarming and collective behavior , including @xcite ) . \n we now introduce a general model with both endogenous and exogenous forces , as with the locust model ( [ eq : locusts ] ) . \n the endogenous forces act between individuals and might include social attraction and repulsion ; see  @xcite for a discussion . for simplicity , we assume that the endogenous forces act in an additive , pairwise manner . \n we also assume that the forces are symmetric , that is , the force induced by particle @xmath9 on particle @xmath8 is the opposite of that induced by particle @xmath8 on particle @xmath9 . \n exogenous forces might include gravity , wind , and taxis towards light or nutrients . \n the governing equations take the form    [ eq : discretesystem ] @xmath23    eventually we will examine the governing equations for a continuum limit of the discrete problem . to this end , we have introduced a _ social mass _ @xmath24 which scales the strength of the endogenous forces so as to remain bounded for @xmath25 . \n @xmath26 is the total social mass of the ensemble . \n ( [ eq : vee ] ) defines the velocity rule ; @xmath27 is the endogenous velocity one particle induces on another , and @xmath28 is the exogenous velocity . from our assumption of symmetry of endogenous forces , @xmath19 is odd and in most realistic situations is discontinuous at the origin . \n each force , @xmath28 and @xmath19 , can be written as the gradient of a potential under the relatively minor assumption of integrability . \n as pointed out in @xcite , most of the specific models for mutual interaction forces proposed in the literature satisfy this requirement . \n many exogenous forces  including gravity and common forms of chemotaxis  do so as well . under this assumption , we rewrite ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) as a gradient flow , @xmath29 where the potential @xmath30 is    [ eq : discrete_gradient ] @xmath31    the double sum describes the endogenous forces and the single sum describes the exogenous forces . also , @xmath32 is the mutual interaction potential , which is even , and @xmath33 is the exogenous potential . \n the flow described by ( [ eq : discretegradient1 ] ) will evolve towards minimizers of the energy @xmath30 .    up to now \n , we have defined the problem on @xmath34 . in order to confine the problem to a particular domain @xmath35 \n , one may use the artifice of letting the exogenous potential @xmath33 tend to infinity on the complement of @xmath35 .    while this discrete model is convenient from a modeling and simulation standpoint , it is difficult to analyze . presently , we will derive a continuum analog of ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) . \n this continuum model will allow us to derive equilibrium solutions and determine their stability via the calculus of variations and integral equation methods .      to derive a continuum model , we begin by describing our evolving ensemble of discrete particles with a density function @xmath15 equal to a sum of @xmath0-functions . \n ( for brevity , we suppress the @xmath36 dependence of @xmath17 in the following discussion . ) \n our approach here is similar to @xcite . \n these @xmath0-functions have strength @xmath24 and are located at the positions of the particles : @xmath37 the total mass is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the domain of the problem . using ( [ eq : deltafuncs ] ) , we write the discrete velocity @xmath40 in terms of a continuum velocity @xmath41 . \n that is , we require @xmath42 where @xmath43 by conservation of mass , the density obeys @xmath44 with no mass flux at the boundary . \n we now introduce an energy functional @xmath45 $ ] which is analogous to the discrete potential @xmath30 in ( [ eq : generic_potential ] ) : @xmath46 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{{\\omega}}\\int_{{\\omega}}\\rho(x ) \\rho(y ) q(x -

\\int_\\omega   \\rho(x ) \\left\\{v(x)\\right\\}^2\\,dx,\\ ] ] where we assume that there is no mass flux at the boundary of @xmath35 . \n a consequence of this boundary condition is that under some conditions , mass may concentrate at the boundary of the domain , and we will later see this manifest . since energy is dissipated , we conclude that stable equilibria correspond to minimizers of @xmath48 . \n imagine now that the energy ( [ eq : continuum_energy ] ) is defined for _ any _ density distribution @xmath17 , not just ensembles of @xmath0-functions . \n we will find minimizers for the continuous energy ( [ eq : continuum_energy ] ) and show that they approximate solutions to the discrete problem in the limit of large @xmath2 . to establish a correspondence between the two frameworks , consider a continuous distribution @xmath49 with total mass @xmath26 . \n define the cumulative density function @xmath50 where the dummy coordinate @xmath51 is taken to the left of the support of @xmath49 . \n we seek a discrete approximation of @xmath2 @xmath0-functions , @xmath52 the associated cumulative density function @xmath53 is @xmath54 & x = x_i,\\quad i = 1,\\ldots , n \\\\ i m & x_i < x < x_{i+1 } , \\quad i = 1,\\ldots , n-1\\\\ m & x > x_n , \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where we have used the convention that integrating up to a @xmath0-function yields half the mass of integrating through it . \n to establish our correspondence , we require that @xmath55 , which in turn determines the particle positions @xmath22 . as @xmath25 for fixed @xmath26 , this step function @xmath53 converges uniformly to @xmath56 . \n the correspondence goes in the opposite direction as well . \n we can begin with an ensemble of @xmath0-functions @xmath57 placed at the positions of discrete swarm members , as shown in figure [ fig : delta_schematic](a ) . \n we can find the corresponding cumulative density @xmath53 via ( [ eq : psid ] ) and interpolate to construct the continuum cumulative density @xmath56 . \n the functions @xmath53 and @xmath56 are shown as the dotted red step function and the blue curve , respectively , in figure [ fig : delta_schematic](b ) . \n we may then differentiate to find an approximation @xmath49 , as shown in figure [ fig : delta_schematic](c ) . \n we use this correspondence in sections [ sec : repulsive ] through [ sec : locust - ground ] to compare analytical results for the continuum system ( [ eq : pde ] ) with numerical simulations of the discrete system ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) . \n we close this subsection by reiterating why we have made a correspondence between the discrete and continuum systems . \n we use the continuous framework to find equilibrium solutions analytically via variational and integral equation methods . \n the correspondence above allows a direct comparison to numerical simulation of the discrete system . \n we use a variational calculation to determine conditions for a density distribution to be a minimizer of @xmath48 . \n our starting point is the energy functional ( [ eq : continuum_energy ] ) subject to the mass constraint ( [ eq : mass_constraint ] ) . \n let @xmath58 here @xmath59 is an equilibrium solution of mass @xmath26 and @xmath60 is a small perturbation of zero mass , so we have    @xmath61    inspired by biological observations of swarms , we focus on equilibria with finite extent and take the support of @xmath59 to be a finite subset of the domain @xmath35 . \n we refer to the support of @xmath59 as @xmath62 . \n this assumption , combined with the fact that the density is nonnegative , restricts the perturbation @xmath63 to be nonnegative on @xmath64 , the complement of @xmath62 . \n we write @xmath65 = w[{{\\bar \\rho } } ] + \\epsilon w_1[{{\\bar \\rho}},{{\\tilde \\rho } } ] + \\epsilon^2 w_2[{{\\tilde \\rho}},{{\\tilde \\rho}}],\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the first and second variations respectively . \n this expression is exact because @xmath48 is quadratic in @xmath17 ( see eq . \n [ eq : continuum_energy ] ) . \n we analyze these variations to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a candidate solution @xmath59 to be a minimizer of @xmath48 . \n our strategy is to consider two classes of perturbations @xmath63 . \n first , we consider perturbations whose support lies in @xmath62 . in order for @xmath59 to be extremal \n , @xmath66 must vanish . for it to be a minimizer \n , @xmath67 must be positive . \n since ( [ eq : expand_w ] ) is exact , @xmath68 guarantees that @xmath59 is both a local and global minimum with respect to this first class of perturbations . \n the second class of perturbations we consider ( of which the first class is a subset ) consists of perturbations on the entire domain @xmath39 . as mentioned above \n , these perturbations must be nonnegative in @xmath64 in order to maintain positivity of @xmath17 . a necessary condition for @xmath59 to be a local minimizer \n is that @xmath69 for this class of perturbations . \n if in addition @xmath67 remains positive for this larger class of perturbations , then @xmath59 is a global minimizer as well . \n we derive the first variation @xmath66 by substituting ( [ eq : expand_rho ] ) into ( [ eq : expand_w ] ) and expanding to first order in @xmath70 , which yields @xmath71 =   \\int_\\omega { { \\tilde \\rho}}\\left [ \\int_\\omega q(x -

mass ) class of perturbations if @xmath59 satisfies ( [ eq : stable ] ) . \n if in addition @xmath67 is positive for these perturbations , then @xmath59 is a global minimizer as well .    in practice \n , we solve the integral equation ( [ eq : fie ] ) to find candidate solutions . \n then , we compute @xmath82 to determine whether @xmath59 is a local minimizer . \n finally , when possible , we show the positivity of @xmath67 to guarantee that @xmath59 is a global minimizer . \n as the continuum limit replaces individual particles with a density , we need to make sure the continuum problem inherits a physical interpretation for the underlying problem . \n if we think about perturbing an equilibrium configuration , we note that mass can not `` tunnel '' between disjoint components of the solution . as such \n we define the concept of a multi - component swarm equilibrium . \n suppose the swarm s support can be divided into a set of @xmath24 disjoint , closed , connected components @xmath91 , that is @xmath92 we define a swarm equilibrium as a configuration in which each individual swarm component is in equilibrium , @xmath93 we can still define @xmath82 in @xmath39 @xmath94 + f(x )   =   \\int_{{\\omega_{{{\\bar \\rho}}}}}q(x - y )   { { \\bar \\rho}}(y)~dy + f(x),\\ ] ] but now @xmath95 in @xmath96 . \n we can now define a swarm minimizer . \n we say a swarm equilibrium is a swarm minimizer if @xmath97 for some neighborhood of each component @xmath96 of the swarm . in practice \n this means that the swarm is an energy minimizer for infinitesimal redistributions of mass in the neighborhood of each component . \n this might also be called a lagrangian minimizer in the sense that the equilibrium is a minimizer with respect to infinitesimal lagrangian deformations of the distributions . \n it is crucial to note that even if a solution @xmath59 is a global minimizer , other multi - component swarm minimizers may still exist . \n these solutions are local minimizers and consequently a global minimizer may not be a global attractor under the dynamics of  ( [ eq : pde ] ) . \n in this section we discuss the minimization problem formulated in section [ sec : formulation ] . \n it is helpful for expository purposes to make a concrete choice for the interaction potential @xmath32 . as previously mentioned , in many physical , chemical , and biological applications , the pairwise potential @xmath32 is symmetric \n . additionally , repulsion dominates at short distances ( to prevent collisions ) and the interaction strength approaches zero for very long distances . \n a common choice for @xmath32 is the morse potential with parameters chosen to describe long - range attraction and short - range repulsion @xcite . for the remainder of this section \n , we consider a simpler example where @xmath32 is the laplace distribution @xmath98 which represents repulsion with strength decaying exponentially in space .    when there is no exogenous potential , @xmath99 , and when the domain is infinite , _ \n e.g. _ , @xmath100 , the swarm will spread without bound . \n the solutions asymptotically approach the barenblatt solution to the porous medium equation as shown in @xcite . \n however , when the domain @xmath39 is bounded or when there is a well in the exogenous potential , bounded swarms are observed both analytically and numerically , as we will show . \n figure [ fig : repulsion_schematic ] shows solutions @xmath101 for three cases : a bounded domain with no exogenous potential , a gravitational potential on a semi - infinite domain , and a quadratic potential well on an infinite domain . in each case , a bounded swarm solution is observed but the solutions are not necessarily continuous and can even contain @xmath0-function concentrations at the boundaries . \n we discuss these three example cases in detail later in this section . \n first , we will formulate the minimization problem for the case of the laplace potential . \n we will attempt to solve the problem classically ; when the solution has compact support contained within the domain we find solutions that are continuous within the support and may have jump discontinuities at the boundary of the support . \n however , when the boundary of the support coincides with the boundary of the domain , the classical solution may break down and it is necessary to include a distributional component in the solution . \n we also formulate explicit conditions for the solutions to be global minimizers . \n we then apply these results to the three examples mentioned above . \n recall that for @xmath59 to be a steady solution , it must satisfy the integral equation ( [ eq : fie ] ) subject to the mass constraint ( [ eq : mass1 ] ) . for @xmath101 to be a local minimizer , it must also satisfy ( [ eq : stable ] ) , @xmath102 finally , recall that for a solution @xmath59 to be a global minimizer , the second variation ( [ eq : second_variation ] ) must be positive . \n we saw that if @xmath78 , this is guaranteed . for ( [ eq : laplace ] ) , @xmath103 and \n so for the remainder of this section , we are able to ignore the issue of  @xmath67 . \n any local minimizer that we find will be a global minimizer . \n additionally , for the remainder of this section , we restrict our attention to cases where the support of the solution @xmath62 is a single interval in @xmath39 ; in other words , the minimizing solution has a connected support . \n the reason that we are able to make this restriction follows from the notion of swarm minimization , discussed above . \n in fact , we can show that there are no multi - component swarm minimizers for the laplace potential as long as the exogenous potential @xmath104 is convex , that is , @xmath105 on @xmath39 . to see this , \n assume we have a swarm minimizer with a at least two disjoint components . \n consider @xmath82 in the gap between two components so that @xmath106 . \n we differentiate @xmath82 twice to obtain @xmath107 note that @xmath108 as @xmath109 in @xmath64 . \n @xmath105 by assumption . \n consequently , @xmath110 in @xmath64 and so @xmath82 is convex upwards in the gap . also , @xmath111 at the endpoints of the gap . \n we conclude from the convexity that @xmath82 must be less than @xmath112 near one of the endpoints . \n this violates the condition of swarm minimization from the previous section , and hence the solution is not a swarm minimizer . since swarm minimization is a necessary condition for global minimization , we now , as discussed , restrict attention to single - component solutions \n .    for concreteness , assume the support of the solution @xmath59 is @xmath113 $ ] . \n we transform the integral equation ( [ eq : fie ] ) for @xmath59 into a differential equation by noting that @xmath114 is the green s function of the differential operator @xmath115 , so that @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the dirac @xmath0-function . applying @xmath118 to both sides of ( [ eq : fie ] ) yields the dirac @xmath0-function under the integral . \n integration and the sifting property of the @xmath0 function lead to @xmath119 = \\frac{\\lambda}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ f-   f''(x ) \\right ]    \\quad { \\rm in } \\ { { \\omega_{{{\\bar \\rho}}}}}. \\label{eq : fie - sol}\\ ] ]    equation ( [ eq : fie - sol ] ) is a necessary condition on a solution @xmath120 but not sufficient . \n in fact , to verify the candidate solution ( [ eq : fie - sol ] ) , we must substitute back into the governing integral equation ( [ eq : fie ] ) . \n we find    @xmath121 & \\equiv &   \\int_\\omega e^{-|x - y| }   \\left \\ \n {   \\frac{\\lambda}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ f(y)-   f''(y ) \\right ]   \\right \\ } dy , \\\\ & = & \\lambda - f(x ) + \\frac{e^{\\alpha - x}}{2}[f(\\alpha)-f'(\\alpha)-\\lambda ] \\\\ & & \\mbox { } + \\frac{e^{x-\\beta}}{2}[f(\\beta)+f'(\\beta)-\\lambda ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the terms other than @xmath122 must vanish for ( [ eq : fie - sol ] ) to be a solution . \n these error terms are spanned by @xmath123 which is the null space of @xmath124 . \n the constraint that these terms must vanish leads to the conditions @xmath125 for a given @xmath104 , both these conditions will only be satisfied for particular choices of @xmath126 and @xmath127 . \n the allowed @xmath126 and @xmath127 then specify @xmath73 which in turn determines the mass @xmath26 through ( [ eq : mass1 ] ) . as we discuss below , the solution derived here is sometimes , but not always , a true minimizer of the energy @xmath48 . \n what we have presented above is the classical view of the solution of ( [ eq : fie ] ) . \n the difficulty with this calculation is that we expect on physical grounds that for every mass @xmath26 and interval @xmath128 there should be a minimizer . \n it is easy to see that if @xmath33 and @xmath32 are bounded from below , the energy @xmath48 is bounded from below also . \n let @xmath129 then directly from ( [ eq : continuum_energy ] ) , @xmath130 since @xmath48 is bounded from below , solutions to the minimization problem exist in the space of measure valued functions @xcite . \n sometimes these solutions are not classical ; when there is finite attraction at small distances , mass can concentrate in a @xmath0-function @xcite . for the more biologically relevant case of repulsion at short scales , in free space and in the absence of an external potential , \n solutions are classical for all time @xcite . \n we now show that ( under sufficient hypotheses ) a @xmath0-function can not occur in the interior of @xmath62 . though we have restricted ourselves ( above ) to considering the laplace potential  ( [ eq : laplace ] ) , \n this is true more generally . \n in fact , suppose that at a point @xmath51 in the interior of @xmath39 ,    * the exogenous potential @xmath104 is twice - differentiable in a neighborhood of @xmath51 , * @xmath114 is twice - differentiable for @xmath131 , * @xmath114 has nonzero repulsion at short distances , that is , @xmath132    then a minimizer does not contain a @xmath0-function at @xmath133 . \n to see this , we will compare the energy of a density containing a @xmath0-function at @xmath133 to one where the @xmath0-function has been replaced by a narrow , unit mass top - hat distribution @xmath134 , @xmath135 and show that the energy is reduced by @xmath136 . \n consider a candidate distribution with a @xmath0-function of mass @xmath24 at @xmath51 , @xmath137 . \n define the change of energy @xmath138 -

hat . \n we conclude that @xmath0-functions may not occur in the interior of @xmath39 under the assumed conditions . \n however , the above reasoning breaks down for @xmath0-functions on the domain boundary , where they may not be replaced by a narrow , symmetric top - hat distribution .      based on the result above \n , we introduce a candidate solution @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are to be determined . the classical solution @xmath150 is supplemented with @xmath0-functions at the boundary of @xmath62 . \n we will show , in agreement with the calculation above , that @xmath148 and @xmath149 must vanish unless the boundary of the support , @xmath62 , coincides with the boundary of the domain , @xmath39 . \n we verify the new candidate solution ( [ eq : fie - sol2 ] ) by substituting back into the governing equation ( [ eq : fie ] ) . \n we find    @xmath151 & \\equiv &   \\int_\\omega e^{-|x - y| }   \\left \\ { { \\bar \\rho(y ) } + a \\delta(y-\\alpha ) + b\\delta(y-\\beta )     \\right \\}\\,dy , \\\\ & = & \\lambda -

negative , nor have we considered whether it is a minimizer . \n we next consider whether the extremal solution @xmath59 is a minimizer , which involves the study of ( [ eq : stable2 ] ) . \n we present a differential operator method that allows us to compute @xmath82 and deduce sufficient conditions for @xmath59 to be a minimizer . \n we start by factoring the differential operator @xmath155 where @xmath156 . applying these operators to the interaction potential @xmath32 \n , we see that @xmath157 substituting @xmath59 in ( [ eq : fie - sol2 ] ) into our definition of @xmath82 in ( [ eq : stable2 ] ) yields @xmath158 now consider applying @xmath159 to ( [ eq : one ] ) at a point @xmath5 in @xmath62 . \n we see that @xmath160   = { \\mathcal{d}^- } [ \\lambda],\\ ] ] where we ve used the fact that @xmath161 in @xmath62 . \n if we let @xmath162 and let @xmath6 decrease to zero , the integral term vanishes and @xmath163 solving for @xmath148 yields the first half of ( [ eq : ab ] ) . \n a similar argument near @xmath164 yields the value of @xmath149 . \n assuming @xmath126 does not coincide with an endpoint of @xmath39 , we now consider the region @xmath165 , which is to the left of the support @xmath62 . again , applying @xmath159 to ( [ eq : fie ] ) simplifies the equation ; we can check that both the integral term and the contribution from the @xmath0-functions are annihilated by this operator , from which we deduce that @xmath166 = 0 \\qquad   \\rightarrow \\qquad f(x)- \n \\lambda(x ) = ce^x,\\ ] ] where @xmath167 is an unknown constant . \n a quick check shows that if @xmath104 is continuous , then @xmath82 is continuous at the endpoints of @xmath62 so that @xmath168 . \n this in turn determines @xmath167 , yielding @xmath169e^{x-\\alpha } \\qquad { \\rm for } \\quad x \\leq \\alpha.\\ ] ] a similar argument near @xmath164 yields @xmath170e^{\\beta -x } \\qquad { \\rm for } \\quad x \\geq \\beta.\\ ] ] as discussed in section [ sec : minimizers ] , for @xmath101 to be a minimizer we wish for @xmath88 for @xmath171 and @xmath172 . \n a little algebra shows that this is equivalent to    [ eq : mincon ] @xmath173    if @xmath126 and @xmath127 are both strictly inside @xmath39 , then ( [ eq : mincon ] ) constitutes sufficient conditions for the extremal solution @xmath59 to be a global minimizer ( recalling that @xmath68 ) . we may also derive a necessary condition at the endpoints of the support from ( [ eq : mincon ] ) . \n as @xmath5 increases to @xmath126 , we may apply lhpital s rule and this equation becomes equivalent to the condition @xmath174 , as expected . \n a similar calculation letting @xmath5 decrease to @xmath127 implies that @xmath175 . \n however , since @xmath59 is a density , we are looking for positive solutions . hence \n , either @xmath176 or @xmath126 coincides with the left endpoint of @xmath39 . \n similarly , either @xmath177 or @xmath127 coincides with the right edge of @xmath39 . \n this is consistent with the result ( [ eq : nodeltas2 ] ) which showed that @xmath0-functions can not occur in the interior of @xmath39 .    in summary \n , we come to two conclusions :    * a globally minimizing solution @xmath59 contains a @xmath0-function only if a boundary of the support of the solution coincides with a boundary of the domain . * a globally minimizing solution @xmath59 must satisfy ( [ eq : mincon ] ) . \n we now consider three concrete examples for @xmath39 and @xmath104 . \n we model a one - dimensional biological swarm with repulsive social interactions described by the laplace potential . \n we begin with the simplest possible case , namely no exogenous potential , @xmath178 and a finite domain which for convenience we take to be the symmetric interval @xmath179 $ ] . \n as @xmath180 we know from ( [ eq : singlecomponent ] ) that the minimizing solution has a connected support , _ \n i.e. _ , it is a single component . \n we will see that the minimizing solution has an equipartition of mass between @xmath0-functions at the boundaries of the domain and a constant solution in the interior , as shown schematically in figure [ fig : repulsion_schematic](a ) . \n we now proceed with calculating the solution . from ( [ eq : fie - sol ] ) , we find that @xmath181 the nonclassical solution is @xmath182 eq . \n ( [ eq : mform ] ) gives @xmath73 as @xmath183 eq . ( [ eq : ab ] ) specifies @xmath148 and @xmath149 as @xmath184 since @xmath185 , it follows that @xmath186 and @xmath66 vanishes according to ( [ eq : w1lambda ] ) . \n therefore , the solution is a global minimizer .    the solution @xmath101 is shown schematically in figure [ fig : repulsion_schematic](a ) . \n figure [ fig : repulsion_numerics](a ) compares analytical and numerical results for an example case where we take the total mass to be @xmath187 and the finite domain to be @xmath188 $ ] with @xmath189 . \n cross - hatched boxes indicate the boundary of the domain . \n the solid line is the classical solution @xmath59 . \n dots correspond to the numerically - obtained equilibrium of the discrete system ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) with @xmath190 swarm members . \n the density at each lagrangian grid point is estimated using the correspondence discussed in section ( [ sec : contmodel ] ) and pictured in figure  [ fig : delta_schematic ] . \n each `` lollipop '' at the domain boundary corresponds to a @xmath0-function of mass @xmath191 in the analytical solution , and simultaneously to a superposition of @xmath192 swarm members in the numerical simulation . \n hence , we see excellent agreement between the continuum minimizer and the numerical equilibrium even for this relatively small number @xmath190 of lagrangian points . \n we now consider repulsive social interactions and an exogenous gravitational potential . \n the spatial coordinate @xmath193 describes the elevation above ground . \n consequently , @xmath39 is the semi - infinite interval @xmath194 . then @xmath195 with @xmath196 , shown in figure [ fig : repulsion_schematic](f ) . as @xmath180 we know from ( [ eq : singlecomponent ] ) that the minimizing solution has a connected support , _ \n i.e. _ , it is a single component . \n moreover , translating this component downward decreases the exogenous energy while leaving the endogenous energy unchanged . \n thus , the support of the solution must be @xmath197 $ ] , potentially with @xmath198 . \n in fact , we will see that there are two possible solution types depending on @xmath12 . for strong enough values of @xmath12 \n , @xmath127 indeed equals zero , and the mass accumulates on the ground @xmath140 , as shown schematically in figure [ fig : repulsion_schematic](d ) . for weaker @xmath12 \n , the mass is partitioned between a @xmath0-function on the ground and a classical solution for @xmath131 , as shown in figure [ fig : repulsion_schematic](e ) . \n we now proceed with calculating the solution . from ( [ eq : fie - sol ] ) , we find that @xmath199 the nonclassical solution is @xmath200 eq . \n ( [ eq : mform ] ) gives @xmath73 as @xmath201 eq . ( [ eq : ab ] ) specifies @xmath148 and @xmath149 as @xmath202 for @xmath59 to be a global minimizer , it must be true that @xmath177 as shown in section [ sec : funcmin ] . \n solving , we find that @xmath203 .    for @xmath204 , we see that @xmath205 in which case the minimizing solution is @xmath206 it follows directly that @xmath207 . \n figure [ fig : repulsion_schematic](e ) shows a schematic drawing of this solution . \n we still must consider the condition ( [ eq : minconb ] ) . to see it is satisfied , first note that @xmath208 . \n then ( [ eq : minconb ] ) becomes @xmath209 we note that by lhpital s rule that equality is obtained as @xmath210 . to show the inequality holds for @xmath211 \n let @xmath212 and @xmath213 ( so @xmath214 ) . the inequality becomes @xmath215 we can interpret the left - hand side as the slope of a chord connecting the points @xmath216 and @xmath217 . \n consequently , if the function @xmath218 is concave upward , the slope of the chord will be increasing as @xmath219 increases away from @xmath220 , and the inequality will hold . recalling that @xmath221 , \n we compute @xmath222^{\\prime \\prime } = g / s$ ] which is positive , and hence the solution is globally stable .    for @xmath223 \n our previous calculation naively implies @xmath224 . \n since @xmath127 can not be negative , the minimizer in this case is a @xmath0-function at the origin , namely @xmath225 , shown in figure [ fig : repulsion_schematic](d ) . in this case , \n @xmath226 from ( [ eq : gravitylambda ] ) and @xmath227 from ( [ eq : lambdaright ] ) . \n it follows that @xmath228 the first inequality follows from a taylor expansion . \n the second follows from our assumption @xmath229 . since @xmath88 the solution is a global minimizer .    in summary \n , there are two cases . when @xmath223 , the globally stable minimizer is a @xmath0-function at the origin . when @xmath230 there is a globally stable minimizer consisting of a @xmath0-function at the origin which is the left - hand endpoint of a compactly - supported classical swarm . \n the two cases are shown schematically in figures [ fig : repulsion_schematic](de ) . \n figure [ fig : repulsion_numerics](b ) compares analytical and numerical results for the latter ( @xmath230 ) case with @xmath187 and @xmath231 . \n we use @xmath190 swarm members for the numerical simulation . the numerical ( dots ) and analytical ( line ) @xmath232 agree , as does the nonclassical part of the solution , pictured as the `` lollipop '' which represents a superposition of @xmath233 swarm members in the numerical simulation having total mass @xmath234 , and simultaneously a @xmath0-function of mass @xmath235 in the analytical solution . \n we now consider the infinite domain @xmath100 with a quadratic exogenous potential well , pictured in figure [ fig : repulsion_schematic](c ) . \n this choice of a quadratic well is representative of a generic potential minimum , as might occur due to a chemoattractant , food source , or light source . \n thus @xmath236 where @xmath237 controls the strength of the potential . \n as @xmath238 we know from ( [ eq : singlecomponent ] ) that the minimizing solution is a single component . \n we take the support of the solution to be @xmath113 $ ] . \n we will find that the compactly supported density is classical and has an inverted parabolic shape , shown in figure [ fig : repulsion_schematic](b ) . \n our calculation proceeds as follows . \n we know from section [ sec : funcmin ] that because @xmath126 and @xmath127 are assumed to be finite , @xmath239 and so the solution is classical . from  ( [ eq : fie - sol ] ) , we find that @xmath240 and , from ( [ eq : ab ] ) , @xmath241 eliminating @xmath73 from these equations and recalling that @xmath242 , it follows that @xmath243 . \n hence , the solution is symmetric around the center of the potential . for convenience , \n we now define @xmath244 . \n ( [ eq : mform ] ) gives @xmath73 in terms of the mass @xmath26 as @xmath245 however , from the second half of ( [ eq : abquad ] ) we know that @xmath246 equating these two expressions for @xmath73 yields that @xmath247 note that @xmath248 increases monotonically from @xmath249 with increasing @xmath26 .    finally , writing the solution @xmath59 in terms of @xmath26 , we have @xmath250 &   |x| \\leq   \\left(\\frac{3m}{2\\gamma } + 1\\right)^{1/3 } - 1 \\\\ 0 & |x| >    \\left(\\frac{3m}{2\\gamma } + 1\\right)^{1/3 } - 1 . \\end{cases}\\ ] ] it follows directly that @xmath207 , and that there is a discontinuity at the edge of the support . \n we now must show that the candidate @xmath59 is a global minimizer , which is done by demonstrating ( [ eq : mincon ] ) . by the same argumentation used for the right endpoint in section [ sec : grav ] \n , it suffices to show that @xmath218 is concave up for @xmath251 which follows directly from algebra . \n hence , the solution is a global minimizer .    the solution @xmath59 is shown schematically in figure [ fig : repulsion_schematic](b ) . \n figure [ fig : repulsion_numerics](b ) compares analytical and numerical results for the case with @xmath187 and @xmath252 , with @xmath253 swarm members used for the numerical solution . \n the numerical ( dots ) and analytical ( line ) @xmath59 agree closely . \n in many physical , chemical , and biological applications , the pairwise potential @xmath32 is isotropic , with a repulsion dominating at short distance and the interaction strength approaching zero for very long distances . \n a common choice for @xmath32 is the morse potential @xmath254 with appropriately chosen parameters . here \n , @xmath5 is the distance between particles , @xmath255 is the characteristic length scale of attraction , and @xmath256 is the characteristic velocity induced by attraction . we have scaled the characteristic repulsive strength and length scale to be unity . in this section we are concerned with the solution of ( [ eq : mass1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fie ] ) with @xmath32 given by ( [ eq : morse ] ) . \n the morse potential has been studied extensively and has become a canonical model for attractive - repulsive interactions @xcite . \n a key characteristic of the potential ( [ eq : morse ] ) is whether or not the parameters @xmath257 are chosen to be in the _ h - stable _ or the _ catastrophic _ regime ; see @xcite for a review . \n consider ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) with @xmath178 . \n if the parameters @xmath257 are chosen in the h - stable regime @xmath258 , then as the number of particles @xmath2 increases , the density distribution of particles approaches a constant , as does the energy per particle . \n stated differently , the particles form a crystalline lattice where the nearest - neighbor distance is approximately equal for all particles ( excluding edge effects ) . as more individuals \n are added to the group , the inter - organism spacing is preserved and the group grows to cover a larger spatial region . if the parameters are chosen outside of the h - stable regime , _ \n i.e. _ , @xmath259 , the system is catastrophic . in this case \n , the energy per particle is unbounded as @xmath260 , and particles pack together more and more closely as n increases . \n our work in @xcite classifies the asymptotic behaviors of the continuum problem  ( [ eq : pde ] ) with morse - type interactions in the absence of an external potential , @xmath99 , and on the real line . in the h - stable regime , the continuum model displays spreading density profiles , while in the catastrophic regime , it forms compactly - supported steady states . \n the distinction between catastrophic and h - stable is related to the fourier transform of the potential @xmath114 . note that ( [ eq : morse ] ) has fourier transform    [ eq : qhatmorse ] @xmath261}{(1+{k}^{2})(1+(kl)^2)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the condition for h - stability is equivalent to @xmath262 . in this case , \n @xmath78 for all @xmath263 , and from section [ sec : minimizers ] , this is sufficient for @xmath68 , or equivalently , linear stability of constant density states . in the catastrophic case , @xmath264 \n intuitively , in the catastrophic case , the constant density state is unstable to long wave perturbations . \n the system is attracted to states of finite extent shorter than the length scale of the instability . in the h - stable case , \n the constant density state is stable to perturbations , and initial density profiles spread evenly to become flat . \n we

the integral term and the terms arising from the @xmath0 functions vanish . \n the equation is simply @xmath288 . \n we write the solution as @xmath289 the two constants @xmath290 are determined as

that @xmath68 for nontrivial perturbations . \n this guarantees that the solution above is a global minimizer .    in the limit of large domain size @xmath334 , \n the analytical solution simplifies substantially . to leading order , \n the expressions ( [ eq : hstablesoln ] ) become    @xmath335    note that @xmath336 is exponentially small except in a boundary layer near each edge of @xmath39 , and therefore the solution is nearly constant in the interior of @xmath39 . \n figure [ fig : morse_numerics](b ) compares analytical and numerical results for an example case with a relatively small value of @xmath334 . \n we take total mass @xmath187 and set the domain half - width to be @xmath189 . the interaction potential parameters @xmath323 and @xmath324 . \n the solid line is the classical

boundary corresponds to a @xmath0-function of mass @xmath191 in the analytical solution , and simultaneously to a superposition of @xmath192 swarm members in the numerical simulation . \n we now return to the locust swarm model of @xcite , discussed also in section [ sec : intro ] . \n recall that locust swarms are observed to have a concentration of individuals on the ground , a gap or `` bubble '' where the density of individuals is near zero , and a sharply delineated swarm of flying individuals . \n this behavior is reproduced in the model ( [ eq : locusts ] ) ; see figure  [ fig : locust](b ) . \n in fact , figure  [ fig : locust](c ) shows that the bubble is present even when the wind in the model is turned off , and only endogenous interactions and gravity are present .    to better understand the structure of the swarm , we consider the analogous continuum problem . to further simplify the model , we note that the vertical structure of the swarm appears to depend only weakly on the horizontal direction , and thus we will construct a _ quasi - two - dimensional _ model in which the horizontal structure is assumed uniform .    in particular , we will make a comparison between a one - dimensional and a quasi - two - dimensional model . both models \n take the form of the energy minimization problem ( [ eq : fie ] ) on a semi - infinite domain , with an exogenous potential @xmath337 describing gravity . \n the models differ in the choice of the endogenous potential @xmath32 , which is chosen to describe either one - dimensional or quasi - two - dimensional repulsion . \n the one - dimensional model is precisely that which we considered in section [ sec : grav ] . \n there we saw that minimizers of the one - dimensional model can reproduce the concentrations of locusts on the ground and a group of individuals above the ground , but there can not be a separation between the grounded and airborne groups . \n we will show below that for the quasi - two - dimensional model , this is not the case , and indeed , some minimizers have a gap between the two groups . \n as mentioned , the one - dimensional and quasi - two - dimensional models incorporate only endogenous repulsion . \n however , the behavior we describe herein does not change for the more biologically realistic situation when attraction is present . \n we consider the repulsion - only case in order to seek the minimal mechanism responsible for the appearance of the gap . \n we consider a swarm in two dimensions , with spatial coordinate @xmath338 . \n we will eventually confine the vertical coordinate @xmath339 to be nonnegative , since it describes the elevation above the ground at @xmath340 . \n we assume the swarm to be uniform in the horizontal direction @xmath341 , so that @xmath342 . \n we construct a quasi - two - dimensional interaction potential , @xmath343 letting @xmath344 and @xmath345 , this yields @xmath346 it is straightforward to show that the two - dimensional energy per unit horizontal length is given by @xmath347 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{{\\omega}}\\int_{{\\omega}}\\rho(x_1 ) \\rho(y_1 ) q_{2d}(x_1-y_1)\\,dx_1\\,dy_1 + \\int_{{\\omega}}f(x_1)\\rho(x_1)\\,dx_1,\\ ] ] where the exogenous force is @xmath348 and the domain @xmath39 is the half - line @xmath349 . \n this is exactly analogous to the one - dimensional problem ( [ eq : continuum_energy ] ) , but with particles interacting according to the quasi - two - dimensional endogenous potential . \n similarly , the corresponding dynamical equations are simply ( [ eq : cont_velocity ] ) and ( [ eq : pde ] ) but with endogenous force @xmath350 .    for the laplace potential ( [ eq : laplace ] ) , the quasi - two - dimensional potential is @xmath351 this integral can be manipulated for ease of calculation ,    @xmath352    where ( [ eq : q2db ] ) comes from symmetry , ( [ eq : q2dc ] ) comes from letting @xmath353 , ( [ eq : q2dd ] ) comes from letting @xmath354 , and ( [ eq : q2de ] ) comes from the trigonometric substitution @xmath355 .    from an asymptotic expansion of ( [ eq : q2dd ] ) \n , we find that for small @xmath356 , @xmath357 whereas for large @xmath356 , @xmath358.\\ ] ] in our numerical study , it is important to have an efficient method of computing values of @xmath359 . in practice , \n we use ( [ eq : smallz ] ) for small @xmath356 , ( [ eq : largez ] ) for large @xmath356 , and for intermediate values of @xmath356 we interpolate from a lookup table pre - computed using  ( [ eq : q2de ] ) . \n the potential @xmath360 is shown in figure [ fig : q2d ] . \n note that @xmath360 is horizontal at @xmath361 , and monotonically decreasing in @xmath356 . \n the negative of the slope @xmath362 reaches a maximum of @xmath363 the quantity @xmath364 plays a key role in our analysis of minimizers below . \n the fourier transform of @xmath360 can be evaluated exactly using the integral definition ( [ eq : q2dc ] ) and interchanging the order of integration of @xmath6 and @xmath365 to obtain @xmath366 which we note is positive , so local minimizers are global minimizers per the discussion in section [ sec : minimizers ] . \n we model a quasi - two - dimensional biological swarm with repulsive social interactions of laplace type and subject to an exogenous gravitational potential , @xmath221 . \n the spatial coordinate @xmath193 describes the elevation above ground . \n consequently , @xmath39 is the semi - infinite interval @xmath194 .    from section [ sec : grav ] , recall that for the one - dimensional model \n , @xmath367 is a minimizer for some @xmath26 , corresponding to all swarm members pinned by gravity to the ground . \n we consider this same solution as a candidate minimizer for the quasi - two - dimensional problem . in this case \n , @xmath59 above is actually a minimizer for any mass @xmath26 . to see this \n , we can compute @xmath82 , @xmath368 since @xmath369 , @xmath370 increases away from the origin and hence @xmath59 is at least a swarm minimizer .    in fact , if @xmath371 , @xmath101 is a global minimizer because @xmath372 which guarantees that @xmath82 is strictly increasing for @xmath373 as shown in figure [ fig : lambda](a ) . because it is strictly increasing , @xmath374 for @xmath131 . \n given this fact , and additionally , since @xmath68 as previously shown , @xmath59 is a global minimizer . \n this means that if an infinitesimal amount of mass is added anywhere in the system , it will descend to the origin . \n consequently , we believe this solution is the global attractor ( though we have not proven this ) .    note that while the condition @xmath375 is sufficient for @xmath59 to be a global minimizer , it is not necessary . as alluded above , \n it is not necessary that @xmath376 be strictly increasing , only that @xmath377 for @xmath131 . \n this is the case for for @xmath378 , where @xmath379 . \n figure [ fig : lambda](b ) shows a case when @xmath380 . \n although @xmath377 for @xmath131 , @xmath82 has a local minimum . \n in this situation , although the solution with the mass concentrated at the origin is a global minimizer , it is _ not _ a global attractor . \n we will see that a small amount of mass added near the local minimum of @xmath82 will create a swarm minimizer , which is dynamically stable to perturbations . \n figure [ fig : lambda](c ) shows the critical case when @xmath381 . in this case \n the local minimum of @xmath82 at @xmath382 satisfies @xmath383 and @xmath384 . \n figure [ fig : lambda](d ) shows the case when @xmath385 and now @xmath386 in the neighborhood of the minimum . in this case \n the solution with the mass concentrated at the origin is only a swarm minimizer ; the energy of the system can be reduced by transporting some of the mass at the origin to the neighborhood of the local minimum .    when @xmath387 it is possible to construct a continuum of swarm minimizers . \n we have conducted a range of simulations for varying @xmath26 and have measured two basic properties of the solutions . \n we set @xmath388 and use @xmath389 in all simulations of the discrete system . \n initially , all the swarm members are high above the ground and we evolve the simulation to equilibrium . figure [ fig : quasi2dnumerics](a ) measures the mass on the ground as a percentage of the total swarm mass . \n the horizontal blue line indicates ( schematically ) that for @xmath390 , the equilibrium consists of all mass concentrated at the origin ; as discussed above , this state is the global minimizer and ( we believe ) the global attractor . as mass \n is increased through @xmath391 , the equilibrium is a swarm minimizer consisting of a classical swarm in the air separated from the origin , and some mass concentrated on the ground . as @xmath26 increases , the proportion of mass located on the ground decreases monotonically . \n figure [ fig : quasi2dnumerics](b ) visualizes the support of the airborne swarm , which exists only for @xmath392 ; the lower and upper data represent the coordinates of the bottom and top of the swarm , respectively . as mass \n is increased , the span of the swarm increases monotonically .    as established above , when @xmath392 , swarm minimizers exist with two components . \n in fact , there is a continuum of swarm minimizers with different proportions of mass in the air and on the ground . \n which minimizer is obtained in simulation depends on initial conditions . \n figure [ fig : lambda2 ] shows two such minimizers for @xmath388 and @xmath393 , and the associated values of @xmath82 ( each obtained from a different initial condition ) . recalling that for a swarm minimizer , each connected component of the swarm , \n @xmath73 is constant , we define @xmath394 for the grounded component and @xmath395 for the airborne component . in figure [ fig : lambda2](ab ) , @xmath396 of the mass is contained in the grounded component . in this case , @xmath397 indicating that the total energy could be reduced by transporting swarm members from the air to the ground . \n in contrast , in figure [ fig : lambda2](cd ) , @xmath398 of the mass is contained in the grounded component . in this case , @xmath399 indicating that the total energy could be reduced by transporting swarm members from the ground to the air . \n note that by continuity , we believe a state exists where @xmath400 , which would correspond to a global minimizer . \n however , this state is clearly not a global attractor and hence will not necessarily be achieved in simulation . \n we ve demonstrated that for @xmath401 one can construct a continuum of swarm minimizers with a gap between grounded and airborne components , and that for @xmath402 these solutions can have a lower energy than the state with the density concentrated solely on the ground . \n by contrast with the one - dimensional system of section [ sec : grav ] in which no gap is observed , these gap states appear to be the generic configuration for sufficiently large mass in the quasi - two - dimensional system . we conclude that dimensionality is crucial element for the formation of the bubble - like shape of real locust swarms . \n in this paper we deeveloped a framework for studying equilibrium solutions for swarming problems . \n we related the discrete swarming problem to an associated continuum model . \n this continuum model has an energy formulation which enables analysis equilibrium solutions and their stability . \n we derived conditions for an equilibrium solution to be a local minimizer , a global minimizer , and/or a swarm minimizer , that is , stable to infinitesimal lagrangian deformations of the mass . \n we found many examples of compactly supported equilibrium solutions , which may be discontinuous at the boundary of the support . \n in addition , when a boundary of the support coincides with the domain boundary , a minimizer may contain a @xmath0-concentration there . \n for the case of exogenous repulsion modeled by the laplace potential , we computed three example equilibria . on a bounded domain , \n the minimizer is a constant density profile with @xmath0-functions at each end . on a half - line with an exogenous gravitational potential , \n the minimizer is a compactly supported linear density profile with a @xmath0-function at the origin . in free space with an exogenous quadratic potential , \n the minimizer is a compactly supported inverted parabola with jump discontinuities at the endpoints . \n each of the aforementioned solutions is also a global minimizer .    to extend the results above \n , we also found analytical solutions for exogenous attractive - repulsive forces , modeled with the morse potential . in the case that the social force was in the catastrophic statistical mechanical regime \n , we found a compactly supported solution whose support is independent of the total population mass . \n this means that within the modeling assumptions , swarms become denser with increasing mass . for the case of an h - stable social force \n , there is no equilibrium solution on an infinite domain . on a finite domain \n , mass is partitioned between a classical solution in the interior and @xmath0-concentrations on the boundary . \n we recall that for the locust model of @xcite ( see figure [ fig : locust ] ) a concentration of locusts occurs on the ground , with a seemingly classical component above , separated by a gap . \n none of the one - dimensional solutions ( for the laplace and morse potentials ) discussed above contain a gap , that is , multiple swarm components that are spatially disconnected , suggesting that this configuration is intrinsically two - dimensional . to study this configuration , we computed a quasi - two - dimensional potential corresponding to a horizontally uniform swarm . \n we demonstrated numerically that for a wide range of parameters , there exists a continuous family of swarm minimizers that consist of a concentration on the ground and a disconnected , classical component in the air , reminiscent of our earlier numerical studies of a discrete locust swarm model . \n we believe that the analytical solutions we found provide a sampling of the rich tapestry of equilibrium solutions that manifest in the general model we have considered , and in nature . \n we hope that these solutions will inspire further analysis and guide future modeling efforts . \n cmt

      "abstract": "This study examines the equilibrium configurations of swarming biological organisms influenced by exogenous and pairwise endogenous forces. Using a discrete dynamical model, we transition to a variational description of the continuum population density, where equilibrium solutions are extrema of an energy functional and satisfy a Fredholm integral equation. We identify conditions under which these extrema are local minimizers, global minimizers, and minimizers against infinitesimal Lagrangian displacements of mass. In one spatial dimension, the research achieves exact analytical solutions for various combinations of exogenous forces, endogenous forces, and domain configurations."

the world average cross - section is 3.72@xmath140.09 nb for @xmath15 production and 2.82@xmath140.09 nb for @xmath16 production @xcite . \n @xmath5 production is studied at 4170 mev , where the cross - section for @xmath17+@xmath18 is @xmath91 nb @xcite . the underlying light quark \n continuum \" background is about 14 nb . \n the relatively large cross - sections , relatively large branching ratios and sufficient luminosities , allow experiments to fully reconstruct one @xmath19 as a  tag . \" \n since the charge and flavor of the tag is then uniquely determined , the rest of the event can be examined for characteristics of the other  known \" particle . to measure absolute branching ratios , for example at the @xmath12 , the rest of the event is fully reconstructed , as well as the tag .    at the @xmath12 @xmath19 meson final states are reconstructed by first evaluating the difference in the energy , @xmath20 , of the decay products with the beam energy . candidates with @xmath20 consistent with zero are selected and then the @xmath19 beam - constrained mass is evaluated , @xmath21 where @xmath22 runs over all the final state particles . \n examples of single and double reconstruction are presented in fig . \n [ cleo - double](a ) that shows the @xmath23 distribution for a @xmath24 or @xmath25 final states . \n these  single tags \" show a large signal and a very small background . \n [ cleo - double](b ) shows a  double \" tag sample where both @xmath3 and @xmath26 candidates in the same event are reconstructed . \n distributions for candidates from either @xmath24 or @xmath25 modes . \n ( b ) the @xmath27 distribution for candidates for candidates from @xmath24 and @xmath25 modes . \n the solid curves are a fits to the signals plus the backgrounds , that are indicated by the dashed shapes . \n the signals are asymmetric due to radiation of the electron beams.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   distributions for candidates from either @xmath24 or @xmath25 modes . \n ( b ) the @xmath27 distribution for candidates for candidates from @xmath24 and @xmath25 modes . \n the solid curves are a fits to the signals plus the backgrounds , that are indicated by the dashed shapes . \n the signals are asymmetric due to radiation of the electron beams.,title=\"fig:\",width=294 ]    other experiments make use of the both the approximately picosecond lifetimes of charm to identify detached vertices , and the decay @xmath28 , which also serves as a flavor tag in the case of @xmath29 transitions . \n in charm meson decays , usually a single branching ratio sets the scale for determinations of most other rates , that are measured relative to it . for @xmath2 and @xmath3 \n these modes are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively . \n cleo - c , on the other hand uses a different technique where the branching ratios of several modes are determined simultaneously and all absolutely . \n consider an ensemble of modes @xmath22 , that are both singly reconstructed and also doubly reconstructed , where all combinations of modes may be used . \n i denote the number of observed single tag charmed particles as @xmath32 , anti - charmed particles as @xmath33 , and double tags as @xmath34 . \n they are related to the number of @xmath13 events ( either charged or neutral ) through their branching ratios @xmath35 as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the reconstruction efficiencies in single and double tag events for each mode . \n ( in practice the differences in each mode between single and double tag events are small , and @xmath39 . ) solving these equations we find @xmath40    cleo - c has recently updated their absolute branching ratio measurements using a 281 pb@xmath41 data sample , an approximately 5 times larger data sample than used by them for their previous publication @xcite . \n the new preliminary results are shown in table  [ tab : dbr ] @xcite . \n ( in this table when two errors follow a number , the first error is statistical and the second systematic ; this will be true for all results quoted in this paper unless specifically indicated . ) \n the absolute branching fractions for charm mesons have been measured with unprecedented accuracy . \n combining the pdg values with the preliminary cleo - c results for @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays , and using the cleo - c results for @xmath5 , i find @xmath42    cleo - c does not quote a branching ratio for @xmath43 mode because of interferences on the dalitz plot . \n the @xmath44 or the @xmath45 modes should be used for normalization . \n since most of the @xmath46 decay modes have been measured as ratios to the @xmath47 mode , i extract an effective branching ratio @xmath48    these rates can be used for many purposes . for example , adding up the number of charm quarks produced in each @xmath49 meson decay at the @xmath50 resonance by summing the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , charmed baryon and twice the charmonium yields gives a rate of 1.09@xmath140.04 , where the largest error comes from the @xmath2 yield . \n there is no definitive evidence for @xmath52 mixing . \n the best limits yet are @xmath53% and @xmath54 both at 95% c. l. the limit on @xmath55 of about 8% is just beginning to probe an interesting range . \n there are two hints that mixing may be soon found . \n belle finds consistency with no mixing at 3.9% c. l. in wrong - sign @xmath30 decays and babar finds consistency with no mixing at 4.5% c. l. in wrong sign @xmath56 decays , thus making further searches more interesting . \n there have not been any observations of cp or t violation . \n this work was supported by the national science foundation under grant # 0553004 . \n i thank m.  artuso , d.  asner , r.  faccini , s.  malvezzi , n.  menaa , p.  onysi , r.  sia and s.  stroiney for interesting discussions and providing data and plots used in this review . \n m. artuso ,  charm decays within the standard model and beyond , \" in _ proc . of the xxii int . \n symp . on lepton & \n photon interactions at high energies _ , ed . \n r. brenner , c. p. de los heros , and j. rathsman , world scientific , singapore ( 2006 ) [ hep - ex/0510052 . \n s. malvezzi , \n @xmath19-meson dalitz fit from focus , \" prepared for 7th conference on intersections between particle and nuclear physics ( cipanp 2000 ) , quebec city , quebec , canada , 22 - 28 may 2000 . published in aip conf \n . proc . * 549 * , 569 ( 2002 ) . \n the @xmath57 modes include @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , that sum to 4.3@xmath140.44 times @xmath61 . \n the @xmath62 modes include the analgous modes to those for the @xmath57 and , inaddition , feeddown from the @xmath57 modes ;

        "abstract": "Charm decay studies offer a unique window into potential new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), especially since CP violation effects from SM are minimal, thus enhancing visibility of new physics contributions. These studies not only provide direct insights into charm decays which are pivotal for understanding decays of other particles like top quarks and potentially Higgs particles, but also enrich our knowledge of strong interactions, decay constants, and final state interactions. Advanced experiments and techniques have enabled precise measurements of charm decay modes, absolute branching ratios, and resonant substructures within multi-body decays."

        "article": "quantum - mechanical fluctuations during an early epoch of inflation provide a plausible mechanism to generate the energy - density perturbations responsible for observed cosmological structure . while it has been known for quite some time that inflation is consistent with open spatial hypersurfaces ( gott 1982 ; guth &  weinberg 1983 ) , attention was initially focussed on models in which there are a very large number of @xmath17-foldings during inflation , resulting in almost exactly flat spatial hypersurfaces for the observable part of the present universe ( guth 1981 ; also see kazanas 1980 ; sato 1981a , b ) . \n this was , perhaps , inevitable because of strong theoretical prejudice towards flat spatial hypersurfaces and their resulting simplicity . \n however , to get a very large number of @xmath17-foldings during inflation it seems necessary that the inflation model have a small dimensionless parameter ( j. r. gott , private communication 1994 ; banks et al . \n 1995 ) , which would require an explanation . \n attempts to reconcile these  favoured \" flat spatial hypersurfaces with observational measures of a low value for the clustered - mass density parameter @xmath1 have concentrated on models in which one postulates the presence of a cosmological constant @xmath18 ( peebles 1984 ) . in the simplest flat-@xmath18 model one assumes a scale - invariant ( harrison 1970 ; peebles &   yu 1970 ; zeldovich 1972 ) primordial power spectrum for gaussian adiabatic energy - density perturbations . \n such a spectrum is generated by quantum - mechanical fluctuations during an early epoch of inflation in a spatially - flat model , provided that the inflaton potential is reasonably flat ( fischler , ratra , &  susskind 1985 , and references therein ) . \n it has been demonstrated that these models are indeed consistent with current observational constraints ( e.g. , stompor , grski , &  banday 1995 ; ostriker &  steinhardt 1995 ; ratra &  sugiyama 1995 ; liddle et al . \n 1996b ; ganga , ratra , &  sugiyama 1996b , hereafter grs ) . \n an alternative , more popular of late , is to accept that the spatial hypersurfaces are not flat . in this case , the radius of curvature for the open spatial sections introduces a new length scale ( in addition to the hubble length ) , which requires a generalization of the usual flat - space scale - invariant spectrum ( ratra &  peebles 1994 , hereafter rp94 ) . \n such a spectrum is generated by quantum - mechanical fluctuations during an epoch of inflation in an open - bubble model ( rp94 ; ratra &  peebles 1995 , hereafter rp95 ; bucher et al . 1995 , hereafter bgt ; lyth &  woszczyna 1995 ; yamamoto et al . \n 1995 , hereafter yst ) , provided that the inflaton potential inside the bubble is reasonably flat . \n such gaussian adiabatic open - bubble inflation models have also been shown to be consistent with current observational constraints ( rp94 ; kamionkowski et al . \n 1994 ; grski et al . \n 1995 , hereafter grsb ; liddle et al . 1996a , hereafter llrv ; ratra et al . \n 1995 ; grs ) . \n inflation theory by itself is unable to predict the normalization amplitude for the energy - density perturbations . \n currently , the least controversial and most robust method for the normalization of a cosmological model is to fix the amplitude of the model - predicted large - scale cmb spatial anisotropy by comparing it to the observed cmb anisotropy discovered by the @xmath0-dmr experiment ( smoot et al . \n 1992 ) .    previously , specific open cold dark matter ( cdm ) models have been examined in light of the @xmath0-dmr two - year results ( bennett et al . \n grsb investigated the cmb anisotropy angular spectra predicted by the open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ) , and compared large - scale structure predictions of this dmr - normalized model to observational data . \n cayn et al . \n ( 1996 ) performed a related analysis for the open model with a flat - space scale - invariant spectrum ( wilson 1983 , hereafter w83 ) , and yamamoto &  bunn ( 1996 , hereafter yb ) examined the effect of additional sources of quantum fluctuations ( bgt ; yst ) in the open - bubble inflation model .    in this paper \n , we study the observational predictions for a number of open cdm models . \n in particular , we employ the power spectrum estimation technique devised by grski ( 1994 ) for incomplete sky coverage to normalize the open models using the @xmath0-dmr four - year data ( bennett  1996 ) . \n in @xmath19 we provide an overview of open - bubble inflation cosmogonies . \n in @xmath20 we detail the various dmr data sets used in the analyses here , discuss the various open models we consider , and present the dmr estimate of the cmb rms quadrupole anisotropy amplitude @xmath21 as a function of @xmath1 for these open models . in @xmath22 \n we detail the computation of several cosmographic and large - scale structure statistics for the dmr - normalized open models . \n these statistics are confronted by various current observational constraints in @xmath23 . \n our results are summarized in @xmath24 . \n the simplest open inflation model is that in which a single open - inflation bubble nucleates in a ( possibly ) spatially - flat , inflating spacetime ( gott 1982 ; guth &  weinberg 1983 ) . in this model , \n the first epoch of inflation smooths away any preexisting spatial inhomogeneities , while simultaneously generating quantum - mechanical zero - point fluctuations . \n then , in a tunnelling event , an open - inflation bubble nucleates , and for a small enough nucleation probability the observable universe lies inside a single open - inflation bubble . fluctuations of relevance to the late - time universe can be generated via three different quantum mechanical mechanisms : ( 1 ) they can be generated in the first epoch of inflation ; ( 2 ) they can be generated during the tunnelling event ( thus resulting in a slightly inhomogeneous initial hypersurface inside the bubble , or a slightly non - spherical bubble ) ; and ( 3 ) they can be generated inside the bubble . \n the tunneling amplitude is largest for the most symmetrical solution ( and deviations from symmetry lead to an exponential suppression ) , so it has usually been assumed that the nucleation process ( mechanism [ 2 ] ) does not lead to the generation of significant inhomogeneities . \n quantum - mechanical fluctuations generated during evolution inside the bubble ( rp95 ) are significant . assuming that the energy - density difference between the two epochs of inflation is negligible ( and so the bubble wall is not significant ) \n , one may estimate the contribution to the perturbation spectrum after bubble nucleation from quantum - mechanical fluctuations during the first epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) . as discussed by bucher &  turok ( 1995 , hereafter bt ) ( also see yst ; yb ) , the observable predictions of these simple open - bubble inflation models are almost completely insensitive to the details of the first epoch of inflation , for the observationally - viable range of @xmath1 . \n this is because the fluctuations generated during this epoch affect only the smallest wavenumber part of the energy - density perturbation power spectrum , which can not contribute significantly to observable quantities because of the spatial curvature length \n cutoff \" in an open universe ( e.g. , w83 ; kamionkowski &  spergel 1994 ; rp95 ) . \n inclusion of such fluctuations in the calculations alter the predictions for the present value of the rms linear mass fluctuations averaged over an @xmath25 mpc sphere , @xmath26 $ ] , by @xmath27 ( which is comparable to our computational accuracy ) .    besides the open - bubble inflation model spectra , a variety of alternatives have also been considered . \n predictions for the usual flat - space scale - invariant spectrum in an open model have been examined ( w83 ; abbott &  schaefer 1986 ; gouda , sugiyama , &  sasaki 1991 ; sugiyama &  gouda 1992 ; kamionkowski &  spergel 1994 ; sugiyama &  silk 1994 ; cayn et al . \n the possibility that the standard formulation of quantum mechanics is incorrect in an open universe , and that allowance must be made for non - square - integrable basis functions has been investigated ( lyth &  woszczyna 1995 ) , and other spectra have also been considered ( e.g. , w83 ; abbott &  schaefer 1986 ; kamionkowski &  spergel 1994 ) . \n these spectra , being inconsistent with either standard quantum mechanics or the length scale set by spatial curvature , are of historical interest . \n more recently , the open - bubble inflation scenario has been further elaborated on . \n yst have considered a very specific model for the nucleation of the open bubble in a spatially - flat de sitter spacetime , and demonstrated a possible additional contribution from a non - square - integrable basis function which depends on the form of the potential , and on the assumed form of the quantum state prior to bubble nucleation . however , since the non - square - integrable basis function contributes only on the very largest scales , the spatial curvature  cutoff \" in an open universe makes almost all of the model predictions insensitive to this basis function , for the observationally - viable range of @xmath1 ( yst ; yb ) . \n for example , at @xmath28 its effect is to change @xmath26 $ ]  by @xmath29 .    an additional possible effect determined for the specific model of an open - inflation bubble nucleating in a spatially - flat de sitter \n spacetime is that fluctuations of the bubble wall behave like a non - square - integrable basis function ( hamazaki et al . \n 1996 ; garriga 1996 ; garca - bellido 1996 ; yamamoto , sasaki , &  tanaka 1996 ) . while there are models in which these bubble - wall fluctuations are completely insignificant ( garriga 1996 ; yamamoto et al . \n 1996 ) , there is as yet no computation that accounts for both the bubble - wall fluctuations as well as those generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( which are always present ) , so it is not yet known if bubble - wall fluctuations can give rise to an observationally significant effect . \n finally , again in this very specific model , the effects of a finite bubble size at nucleation seem to alter the zero bubble size predictions only by a very small amount ( yamamoto et al . \n 1996 ; cohn 1996 ) .    while there is no guarantee that there is a spatially - flat de sitter spacetime prior to bubble nucleation \n , these computations do illustrate the important point that the spatial curvature length  cutoff \" in an open universe ( e.g. , rp95 ) does seem to ensure that what happens prior to bubble nucleation does not significantly affect the observable predictions for observationally - viable single - field open - bubble inflation models . \n it is indeed reassuring that accounting only for the quantum mechanical fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( rp94 ) seems to be essentially all that is required to make observational predictions for the single - field open - bubble inflation models . \n that is , the observational predictions of the open - bubble inflation scenario seem to be as robust as those for the spatially - flat inflation scenario . \n in this paper , we utilize the dmr four - year 53 and 90 ghz sky maps in both galactic and ecliptic coordinates . \n we thus quantify explicitly the expected small shifts in the inferred normalization amplitudes due to the small differences between the galactic- and ecliptic - coordinate maps . \n the maps are coadded using inverse - noise - variance weights derived in each coordinate system . \n the least sensitive 31 ghz maps have been omitted from the analysis , since their contribution is minimal under such a weighting scheme . \n the dominant source of emission in the dmr maps is due to the galactic plane . \n we are unable to model this contribution to the sky temperature to sufficient accuracy to enable its subtraction , thus we excise all pixels where the galactic - plane signal dominates the cmb . \n the geometry of the cut has been determined by using the dirbe 140 @xmath30 m map as a tracer of the strongest emission , as described completely in banday  ( 1996a ) . \n all pixels with galactic latitude @xmath31 20@xmath32@xmath33 are removed , together with regions towards scorpius - ophiucus and taurus - orion . \n there are 3881 surviving pixels in galactic coordinates and 3890 in ecliptic . \n this extended ( four - year data ) galactic plane cut has provided the biggest impact on the analysis of the dmr data ( see grski et al . \n 1996 , hereafter g96 ) . \n the extent to which residual high - latitude galactic emission can modify our results has been quantified in two ways . since the spatial morphology of galactic synchrotron \n , free - free and dust emission seems to be well described by a steeply falling power spectrum ( @xmath34  kogut  1996a , g96 ) , the cosmological signal is predominantly compromised on the largest angular scales . as a simple test of galactic contamination \n , we perform all computations both including and excluding the observed sky quadrupole . a more detailed approach ( g96 ) \n notes that a large fraction of the galactic signal can be accounted for by using the dirbe 140 @xmath30 m sky map ( reach  1995 ) as a template for free - free and dust emission , and the 408 mhz all - sky radio survey ( haslam  1981 ) to describe synchrotron emission . \n a correlation analysis yields coupling coefficients for the two templates at each of the dmr frequencies . \n we have repeated our model analysis after correcting the coadded sky maps by the galactic templates scaled by the coefficients derived in g96 . in particular , we adopt those values derived under the assumption that the cmb anisotropy is well - described by an @xmath35 = 1 power law model with normalization amplitude @xmath21  @xmath36 18 @xmath30k  and coupling coefficient amplitudes . \n in fact , we have investigated this for a sub - sample of the models considered here in which we varied @xmath1 but fixed @xmath2 and @xmath10 . \n no statistically significant changes were found in the derived values of either @xmath21  or the coupling coefficients . ] . \n one might make criticisms of either technique : excluding information from an analysis , in this case the quadrupole components , can obviously weaken any conclusions simply because statistical uncertainties will grow ; at the same time , it is not clear whether the galactic corrections applied are completely adequate . \n we believe that , given these uncertainties , our analysis is the most complete and conservative one that is possible .    the power spectrum analysis technique developed by grski ( 1994 ) is implemented . \n orthogonal basis functions for the fourier decomposition of the sky maps are constructed which specifically include both pixelization effects and the galactic cut . \n ( these are linear combinations of the usual spherical harmonics with multipole @xmath37 . ) \n the functions are coordinate system dependent . a likelihood analysis is then performed as described in grski  ( 1994 ) . \n we consider four open model energy - density perturbation power spectra : ( 1 ) the open - bubble inflation model spectrum , accounting only for fluctuations that are generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( rp94 ) ; ( 2 ) the open - bubble inflation model spectrum , now also accounting for the fluctuations generated in the first epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) ; ( 3 ) the open - bubble inflation model spectrum , now also accounting for both the usual fluctuations generated in the first epoch of inflation and a contribution from a non - square - integrable basis function ( yst ) ; and , ( 4 ) an open model with a flat - space scale - invariant spectrum ( w83 ) . in all cases \n we have ignored the possibility of tilt or primordial gravity waves , since it is unlikely that they can have a significant effect in viable open models .    with the eigenvalue of the spatial scalar laplacian being @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the radial coordinate spatial wavenumber , the gauge - invariant fractional energy - density perturbation power spectrum of type ( 1 ) above is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the transfer function and @xmath42 is the normalization amplitude ) generalize the primordial part of the spectrum of eq . \n ( 1 ) by multiplying it with @xmath43 . as yet , only the specific @xmath44 generalized spectrum ( i.e. , eq . \n [ 1 ] ) is known to be a prediction of an open - bubble inflation model and therefore consistent with the presence of spatial curvature . \n it is premature to draw conclusions about open cosmogony on the basis of the @xmath45 version of the spectrum considered by bw . ] . in the simplest example , perturbations generated in the first epoch of inflation introduce an additional multiplicative factor , @xmath46 , on the right hand side of eq . \n ( 1 ) . for a discussion of the effects of the non - square - integrable basis function see yst and yb . \n the energy - density power spectrum of type ( 4 ) above is @xmath47 and in this case one can also consider , e.g. , @xmath48 ( w83 ) , but because of the spatial curvature  cutoff \" in an open model the predictions are essentially indistinguishable . at \n small @xmath49 the asymptotic expressions are @xmath50 ( type 1 ) , @xmath51 ( type 2 ) , and @xmath52 ( type 4 ) . \n conventionally , the cmb fractional temperature perturbation , @xmath53 , is expressed as a function of angular position , @xmath54 , on the sky via the spherical harmonic decomposition , @xmath55 the cmb spatial anisotropy in a gaussian model can then be characterized by the angular perturbation spectrum @xmath56 , defined in terms of the ensemble average , @xmath57    the @xmath56 s used here were computed using two independent boltzmann transfer codes developed by ns ( e.g. , sugiyama 1995 ) and rs ( e.g. , stompor 1994 ) . \n some illustrative comparisons are shown in fig . \n we emphasize that the excellent agreement between the @xmath56 s computed using the two codes is mostly a reflection of the currently achievable numerical accuracy . \n currently , the major likely additional , unaccounted for , source of uncertainty is that due to the uncertainty in the modelling of various physical effects . \n the computations here assume a standard recombination thermal history , and ignore the possibility of early reionization . \n the simplest open models ( with the least possible number of free parameters ) have yet to be ruled out by observational data ( grsb ; ratra et al . \n 1995 ; grs ; this paper ) , so there is insufficient motivation to expand the model - parameter space by including the effect of early reionization , tilt or gravity waves values determined from the dmr data here ( assuming no early reionization ) are unlikely to be very significantly affected by early reionization . however , since structure forms earlier in an open model , other effects of early reionization might be more significant in an open model . \n while it is possible to heuristically account for such effects , an accurate quantitative estimate must await a better understanding of structure formation . ] . \n for the @xmath58 of types ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 4 ) above , we have evaluated the cmb anisotropy angular spectra for a range of @xmath1 spanning the interval between 0.1 and 1.0 , for a variety of values of @xmath2 ( the hubble parameter @xmath59 ) and the baryonic - mass density parameter @xmath10 . \n the values of @xmath2 were selected to cover the lower part of the range of ages consistent with current requirements ( @xmath60 10.5 gyr , 12 gyr , or 13.5 gyr , with @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 computed accordingly ; see , for example , jimenez et al . \n 1996 ; chaboyer et al . \n the values of @xmath10 were chosen to be consistent with current standard nucleosynthesis requirements ( @xmath61 0.0055 , 0.0125 , or 0.0205 ; e.g. , copi , schramm , &   turner 1995 ; sarkar 1996 ) . to render the problem tractable , \n @xmath56 s were determined for the central values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and for the two combinations of these parameters which most perturb the @xmath56 s from those computed at the central values ( i.e. , for the smallest @xmath62 we used the smallest @xmath63 , and for the largest @xmath62 we used the largest @xmath63 ) . \n specific parameter values are given in columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of tables 16 , and representative anisotropy spectra can be seen in figs . 2 and 3 . \n we therefore improve on our earlier analysis of the dmr two - year data ( grsb ) by considering a suitably broader range in the ( @xmath10 , @xmath2 ) parameter space . \n the cmb anisotropy spectra for @xmath58 of type ( 3 ) above were computed for a range of @xmath1 spanning the interval between 0.1 and 0.9 , for @xmath64 and @xmath65 . \n specific parameter values are given in columns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of table 7 , and these spectra are shown in fig . \n 4 . in fig . \n 5 we compare the various spectra considered here .    the differences in the low-@xmath66 shapes of the @xmath56 s in the various models ( figs . \n 25 ) are a consequence of three effects : ( 1 ) the shape of the energy - density perturbation power spectrum at low wavenumber ; ( 2 ) the exponential suppression at the spatial curvature scale in an open model ; and ( 3 ) the interplay between the  usual \" ( fiducial cdm ) sachs - wolfe term and the  integrated \" sachs - wolfe ( hereafter sw ) term in the expression for the cmb spatial anisotropy . the relative importance of these effects is determined by the value of @xmath1 , and leads to the non - monotonic behaviour of the large - scale @xmath56 s as a function of @xmath1 seen in figs . \n more precisely , the contributions to the cmb anisotropy angular spectrum from the  usual \" and  integrated \" sw terms have a different @xmath66-dependence as well as a relative amplitude that is both @xmath1 and @xmath58 dependent .    on very large angular scales ( small @xmath66 s ) , the dominant contribution to the  usual \" sw term comes from a higher redshift ( when the length scales are smaller ) than does the dominant contribution to the  integrated \" sw term ( hu &  sugiyama 1994 , 1995 ) . as a result , in an open model on very large angular scales , the  usual \" \n sw term is cut off more sharply by the spatial curvature length scale than is the  integrated \" sw term ( hu &  sugiyama 1994 ) , i.e. , on very large angular scales in an open model the  usual \" sw term has a larger ( positive ) effective index @xmath35 than the  integrated \" sw term . on slightly smaller angular scales \n the  integrated \" sw term is damped ( i.e. , it has a negative effective index @xmath35 ) while the  usual \" sw term plateaus ( hu &  sugiyama 1994 ) . as a consequence , going from the largest to slightly smaller angular scales , the \n usual \" term rises steeply and then flattens , while the  integrated \" term rises less steeply and then drops ( i.e. , it has a peak ) . \n the change in shape , as a function of @xmath66 , of these two terms is both @xmath1 and @xmath58 dependent . \n these are the two dominant effects at @xmath67 ; at higher @xmath66 other effects come into play . \n more specifically , for @xmath68 the curvature length scale cutoff and the precise large - scale form of the @xmath58 considered here are relatively unimportant  the cmb anisotropy angular spectrum is quite similar to that for @xmath69 , and the dominant contribution is the  usual \" sw term . for a @xmath58 that does not diverge at low wavenumber , as with the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum in an open model , for @xmath70 the exponential  cutoff \" at the spatial curvature length dominates , and the lowest-@xmath66 @xmath56 s are suppressed ( figs . 3 and 5 ) . for this @xmath58 , \n as @xmath1 is reduced , the  usual \" term continues to be important on the largest angular scales down to @xmath28 . \n as @xmath1 is reduced below @xmath71 the  integrated \" term starts to dominate on the largest angular scales , and as @xmath1 is further reduced the  integrated \" term also starts to dominate on smaller angular scales . from fig . \n 3(a ) one will notice that the  integrated \" sw term  peak \" first makes an appearance at @xmath72  the central line in the plot at @xmath73  and that as @xmath1 is further reduced ( in descending order along the curves shown ) the  integrated \" term  peak \" moves to smaller angular scales . \n the @xmath74 case is where the  integrated \" term peaks at @xmath75 , and the damping of this term on smaller angular scales ( @xmath76 ) is compensated for by the steep rise of the  usual \" sw term  the two terms are of roughly equal magnitude at @xmath77  and these effects result in the almost exactly scale - invariant spectrum at @xmath9 ( this case is more scale - invariant than fiducial cdm ) . \n a discussion of some of these features of the cmb anisotropy angular spectrum in the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model is given in cayn et al . \n ( 1996 ) . \n open - bubble inflation models have a @xmath58 that diverges at low wavenumber ( rp95 ; note that no physical quantity diverges ) , and this increases the low-@xmath66 @xmath56 s ( figs . 2 and 5 ) relative to those of the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model ( figs . 3 and 5 ) . \n the @xmath56 s for low @xmath1 models increase more than the higher @xmath1 ones , since , for a fixed wavenumber - dependence of @xmath58 , the divergence is more prominent at lower @xmath1 ( rp94 ) . \n the non - square - integrable basis function ( yst ) contributes even more power on large angular scales , and so , at low-@xmath66 , the @xmath56 s of fig . \n 4 are slightly larger than those of fig . \n 2 ( also see fig . 5 ) . again \n , spectra at lower values of @xmath1 are more significantly influenced .    as is clear from figs . 2 and 5 , in an open - bubble inflation model \n , quantum - mechanical zero - point fluctuations generated in the first epoch of inflation scarcely affect the @xmath56 s , although at the very lowest values of @xmath1 the very lowest order @xmath56 coefficients are slightly modified . \n the effect is concentrated in this region of the parameter space since the fluctuations in the first inflation epoch only contribute to , and increase , the lowest wavenumber part of @xmath58 . in simple open - bubble inflation models , \n the precise value of this small effect is dependent on the model assumed for the first epoch of inflation ( bt ) . \n since the dmr data is most sensitive to multipole moments with @xmath78 810 , one expects the effect at @xmath78 23 to be almost completely negligible ( bt ; also see yst ; yb ) .    figs . \n 35 show that both the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model , and the contribution from the non - square - integrable mode , do lead to significantly different @xmath56 s ( compared to those of fig . \n the results of the dmr likelihood analyses are summarized in figs . 621 and tables 17 and 13 . \n two representative sets of likelihood functions @xmath79 are shown in figs . 6 and 7 . \n figure 6 shows those derived from the ecliptic - frame sky maps , ignoring the correction for faint high - latitude foreground galactic emission , and excluding the quadrupole moment from the analysis . \n figure 7 shows the likelihood functions derived from the galactic - frame sky maps , accounting for the faint high - latitude foreground galactic emission correction , and including the quadrupole moment in the analysis . \n together , these two data sets span the maximum range of normalizations inferred from our analysis ( the former providing the highest , and the latter the lowest @xmath21 ) . \n tables 17 give the @xmath21 central values and 1-@xmath80 and 2-@xmath80 ranges for spectra of type ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) above , computed from the appropriate posterior probability density distribution function assuming a uniform prior . each line in tables 17 lists these values at a given @xmath1 for the 8 possible combinations of : ( 1 ) galactic- or ecliptic - coordinate map ; ( 2 ) faint high - latitude galactic foreground emission correction accounted for or ignored ; and , ( 3 ) quadrupole included ( @xmath81 ) or excluded ( @xmath82 ) value of varying cosmological parameters like @xmath10 . \n since they do not quote derived @xmath21 values for this model we are not able to compare to their results . ] . \n the corresponding ridge lines of maximum likelihood @xmath21 value as a function of @xmath1 are shown in figs . \n 810 for some of the cosmological - parameter values considered here . \n although we have computed these values for spectra of type ( 2 ) above ( i.e. , those accounting for perturbations generated in the first epoch of inflation ) we record only a subset of them in column ( 4 ) of table 13 . these should be compared to columns ( 2 ) and ( 6 ) of table 13 , which show the maximal 2-@xmath80 @xmath21 range for spectra of types ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) . \n while the differences in @xmath21 between spectra ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) [ cols . ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) of table 13 ] are not totally insignificant , more importantly the differences between the @xmath26 $ ]  values for the three spectra [ cols . \n ( 3 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 7 ) of table 13 ] are observationally insignificant . \n the entries in tables 16 illustrate the shift in the inferred normalization amplitudes due to changes in @xmath2 and @xmath10 . \n these shifts are larger for models with a larger @xmath1 , since these models have cmb anisotropy spectra that rise somewhat more rapidly towards large @xmath66 , so in these cases the dmr data is sensitive to somewhat smaller angular scales where the effects of varying @xmath2 and @xmath63 are more prominent . \n figure 11 shows the effects that varying @xmath62 and @xmath63 have on some of the ridge lines of maximum likelihood @xmath21 as a function of @xmath1 , and fig . \n 13 illustrates the effects on some of the conditional ( fixed @xmath1 slice ) likelihood densities for @xmath83 on the whole , for the cmb anisotropy spectra considered here , shifts in @xmath2 and @xmath84 have only a small effect on the inferred normalization amplitude . \n the normalization amplitude is somewhat more sensitive to the differences between the galactic- and ecliptic - coordinate sky maps , to the foreground high - latitude galactic emission treatment , and to the inclusion or exclusion of the @xmath85 moment . \n for the purpose of normalizing models , we choose for our 2-@xmath80 c.l . \n bounds values from the likelihood fits that span the maximal range in the @xmath21  normalizations . \n specifically , for the lower 2-@xmath80 bound we adopt the value determined from the analysis of the galactic - coordinate maps accounting for the high - latitude galactic emission correction and including the @xmath85 moment in the analysis , and for the upper 2-@xmath80 value that determined from the analysis of the ecliptic - coordinate maps ignoring the galactic emission correction and excluding the @xmath85 moment from the analysis . \n these values are recorded in columns ( 5 ) and ( 8) of tables 912 , and columns ( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 6 ) of table 13 ) were used in the likelihood analyses of the various model spectra , and different interpolation methods were used in the determination of the @xmath21 values , there are small ( but insignificant ) differences in the quoted @xmath21 values for some identical models in these tables . ] . \n figure 12 compares the ridge lines of maximum likelihood @xmath21 value , as a function of @xmath1 , for the four different cmb anisotropy angular spectra considered here , and fig . \n 14 compares some of the conditional ( fixed @xmath1 slice ) likelihood densities for @xmath21 for these four cmb anisotropy angular spectra . \n approximate fitting formulae may be derived to describe the above two extreme 2-@xmath80 limits . for the open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ;

yst ) , and those from the non - square - integrable basis function ( yst ) , the dmr two - year data ecliptic - frame quadrupole - included marginal likelihood ( shown as the solid line in fig . 3 of yb ) is in general agreement with the dot - dashed line of fig . \n however , yb did not compute for the case where the quadrupole moment was excluded from the analysis and so did not find the peak at @xmath99 in fig . \n 19 .    given the shapes of the marginal likelihoods in figs . \n 1721 , it is not at all clear if it is meaningful to derive limits on @xmath1 without making use of other ( prior ) information . as an example , it is not at all clear what to use for the integration range in @xmath1 . \n focussing on fig . \n 21(a ) ( which is similar to the other quadrupole excluded cases ) , the only conclusion seems to be that @xmath9 is the value most consistent with the dmr data ( at least amongst those models with @xmath14  some of the models have another peak at @xmath100 , grsb ) . however , when the quadrupole moment is included in the analysis ( as in fig . \n 21b ) , the open - bubble inflation model peaks are at @xmath12 ( at least in the range @xmath14 , grsb ) , while the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model peak is at @xmath11 . at the 95% c.l . \n no value of @xmath1 over the range considered , 0.11 , is excluded . \n ( the yb and bw claims of a lower limit on @xmath1 from the dmr data alone are , at the very least , premature . ) \n the @xmath58 ( e.g. , eqs . [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ) were determined from a numerical integration of the linear perturbation theory equations of motion . \n as before , the computations were performed with two independent numerical codes . \n for some of the model - parameter values considered here the results of the two computations were compared and found to be in excellent agreement . \n illustrative examples of the comparisons are shown in fig . \n again , we emphasize that the excellent agreement is mostly a reflection of the currently available numerical accuracy , and the most likely additional , unaccounted for , source of uncertainty is that due to the uncertainty in the modelling of various physical effects . \n table 8 list the @xmath58 normalization amplitudes @xmath42 ( e.g. , eqs .

[ 5 ] and [ 8 ] of table 10 ) , the @xmath58 normalization factor ( eq . [ 1 ] and table 8) for the open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ; bgt ; yst ) , may be summarized by , for the lower 2-@xmath80 limit , @xmath102 ,   \\eqno(8)\\ ] ] and for the upper 2-@xmath80 limit , @xmath103 . \n \\eqno(9)\\ ] ] these fits are good to @xmath104 for @xmath14 . \n note however that they are derived using the @xmath21 values determined for given @xmath62 and @xmath63 and hence do not account for the additional uncertainty introduced by allowed variations in these parameters ( which could affect the power spectrum normalization amplitude by as much as @xmath105 ) . from fig . \n 23(e ) , and given the uncertainties , we see that the fitting formulae of eqs . \n ( 8) and ( 9 ) provide an adequate summary for all the open - bubble inflation model spectra .    the extreme @xmath106-@xmath80 @xmath58 normalization factor ( eq . \n [ 2 ] and table 8) for the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model ( w83 ) may be summarized by , for the lower 2-@xmath80 limit , @xmath107 ,   \\eqno(10)\\ ] ] and for the upper 2-@xmath80 limit , @xmath108 . \n \\eqno(11)\\ ] ] these fits are good to better than @xmath88 for @xmath109 ; again , they are derived from @xmath21 values determined at given @xmath62 and @xmath63 . \n given the uncertainties involved in the normalization procedure ( born of both statistical and other arguments ) it is not yet possible to quote a unique dmr normalization amplitude ( g96 ) . \n as a  central \" value for the @xmath58 normalization factor , we currently advocate the mean of eqs . \n ( 8) and ( 9 ) or eqs . ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) as required . \n we emphasize , however , that it is incorrect to draw conclusions about model viability based solely on this  central \" value .    in conjunction with numerically determined transfer functions , \n the fits of eqs . \n ( 8)(11 ) allow for a determination of @xmath26 $ ] , accurate to a few percent . here \n the mean square linear mass fluctuation averaged over a sphere of coordinate radius @xmath110 is @xmath111 ^ 2\\right\\rangle    & = &     { 2 \\over \\pi^2 \\left[{\\rm sinh } ( \\bar\\chi)\\ , { \\rm cosh}(\\bar\\chi )      -

fraction , @xmath114 , models where the error could be as large as @xmath115 ) . \n use of the analytic fits of eqs . \n ( 8)(11 ) for @xmath42 ( instead of the numerically determined values ) slightly increases the error , while use of the bbks transfer function fit parameterized by an earlier version of eq . \n ( 13 ) below , @xmath116 $ ] , results in @xmath26 $ ] values that could be off by as much as @xmath117 . \n nevertheless , as has been demonstrated by llrv , the approximate analytic fit to the transfer function greatly simplifies the computation and allows for rapid demarcation of the favoured part of cosmological - parameter space . \n numerical values for some cosmographic and large - scale structure statistics for the models considered here are recorded in tables 915 . \n we emphasize that when comparing to observational data we make use of numerically - determined large - scale structure predictions , not those derived using an approximate analytic fitting formula . \n tables 912 give the predictions for the open - bubble inflation model accounting only for the perturbations generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( rp94 ) , and for the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model ( w83 ) . \n each of these tables corresponds to a different pair of @xmath118 values . \n the first two columns in these tables record @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the third column is the cosmological baryonic - matter fraction @xmath119 . \n the fourth column gives the value of the matter power spectrum scaling parameter ( sugiyama 1995 ) , @xmath120 which is used to parameterize approximate analytic fits to the power spectra derived from numerical integration of the perturbation equations . \n the quantities listed in columns ( 1)(4 ) of these tables are sensitive only to the global parameters of the cosmological model . \n columns ( 5 ) and ( 8) of tables 912 give the dmr data 2-@xmath80 range of @xmath21 that is used to normalize the perturbations in the models considered here . the numerical values in table 12 are for @xmath121 gyr , @xmath122 . \n we did not analyze the dmr data using @xmath56 s for these models , and in this case the perturbations are normalized to the @xmath21 values from the @xmath123 gyr , @xmath124 analyses . \n ( as discussed above , shifts in @xmath2 and @xmath63 do not greatly alter the inferred normalization amplitude . )    columns ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) of tables 912 give the 2-@xmath80 range of @xmath125 $ ] . \n these were determined using the @xmath58 derived from numerical integration of the perturbation equations . \n for about two dozen cases , these rms mass fluctuations determined using the two independent numerical integration codes were compared and found to be in excellent agreement . \n ( at fixed @xmath21 , they differ by @xmath126 depending on model - parameter values , with the typical difference being @xmath127 . \n we again emphasize that this is mostly a reflection of currently achievable numerical accuracy . ) . \n to usually better than @xmath128 accuracy , for @xmath129 , the 2-@xmath80 @xmath130 $ ] entries of columns ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) of tables 912 may be summarized by the fitting formulae listed in table 14 . \n these fitting formulae are more accurate than expressions for @xmath26 $ ] derived at the same cosmological - parameter values using an analytic approximation to the transfer function and the normalization of eqs . \n ( 8)(11 ) .    for open models , \n as discussed below , it proves most convenient to characterize the peculiar velocity perturbation by the parameter @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the linear bias factor for @xmath133 galaxies ( e.g. , peacock &  dodds 1994 ) . \n the 2-@xmath80 range of @xmath134 are listed in columns ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) of tables 912 . \n table 13 compares the @xmath113 $ ] values for spectra of types ( 1)(3 ) above . \n clearly , there is no significant observational difference between the predictions for the different spectra . in what follows , for the open - bubble inflation model we concentrate on the type ( 1 ) spectrum above . \n again , the ranges in tables 914 are those determined from the maximal 2-@xmath80 @xmath21 range . table 15 lists  central dmr - normalized \" values for @xmath130 $ ] , defined as the mean of the maximal @xmath1352-@xmath80 entries of tables 912 . \n ( the mean of the @xmath1352-@xmath80 fitting formulae of table 14 may be used to interpolate between the entries of table 15 . ) \n we again emphasize that it is incorrect to draw conclusions about model viability based solely on these  central \" values  for the purpose of constraining model - parameter values by , e.g. , comparing numerical simulation results to observational data one must make use of computations at a few different values of the normalization selected to span the @xmath1352-@xmath80 ranges of tables 912 . \n the dmr likelihoods do not meaningfully exclude any part of the ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath63 ) parameter space for the models considered here . in this section \n we combine current observational constraints on global cosmological parameters with the dmr - normalized model predictions to place constraints on the range of allowed model - parameter values . \n it is important to bear in mind that some measures of observational cosmology remain uncertain thus our analysis here must be viewed as tentative and subject to revision as the observational situation approaches equilibrium . to constrain our model - parameter values \n we have employed the most robust of the current observational constraints . \n tables 912 list some observational predictions for the models considered here , and the boldface entries are those that are inconsistent with current observational data at the 2-@xmath80 significance level .      for each cosmographic or large - scale parameter , \n we have generally chosen to use constraints from a single set of observations or from a single analysis . \n we generally use the most recent analyses since we assume that they incorporate a better understanding of the uncertainties , especially those due to systematics . \n the specific constraints we use are summarized below , where we compare them to those derived from other analyses . \n the model predictions depend on the age of the universe @xmath62 . to reconcile the models with the high measured values of the hubble parameter @xmath2 , we have chosen to focus on @xmath60 10.5 , 12 , and 13.5 gyr , which are near the lower end of the ages now under discussion . \n for instance , jimenez et al . \n ( 1996 ) find that the oldest globular clusters have ages @xmath136 gyr ( also see salaris , deglinnocenti , &  weiss 1996 ; renzini et al . \n 1996 ) , and that it is very unlikely that the oldest clusters are younger than 9.7 gyr . \n the value of @xmath1 is another input parameter for our computations . as summarized by peebles ( 1993 , @xmath137 ) , on scales @xmath138 mpc a variety of different observational measurements indicate that @xmath1 is low . \n for instance , virial analyses of x - ray cluster data indicates @xmath139 , with a 2-@xmath80 range : @xmath140 ( carlberg et al . \n 1996  we have added their 1-@xmath80 statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature and doubled to get the 2-@xmath80 uncertainty ) . in a cdm model in which structure forms at a relatively high redshift ( as is observed ) , these local estimates of @xmath1 do constrain the global value of @xmath1 ( since , in this case , it is inconceivable that the pressureless cdm is much more homogeneously distributed than is the observed baryonic mass ) . \n we hence adopt a 2-@xmath80 upper limit of @xmath141 to constrain the cdm models we consider here . \n ( this large upper limit allows for the possibility that the models might be moderately biased . ) the boldface entries in column ( 1 ) of tables 912 indicates those @xmath1 values inconsistent with this constraint . \n column ( 2 ) of tables 912 gives the value of the hubble parameter @xmath2 that corresponds to the chosen values of @xmath1 and @xmath62 . \n current observational data favours a larger @xmath2 ( e.g. , kennicutt , freedman , & mould 1995 ; baum et al . 1995 ; van den bergh 1995 ; sandage et al . \n 1996 ; ruiz - lapuente 1996 ; riess , press , &  kirshner 1996 ; but also see schaefer 1996 ; branch et al . \n for the purpose of our analysis here we adopt the @xmath142 value @xmath143 ( 1-@xmath80 uncertainty , tanvir et al . \n 1995 ) ; doubling the uncertainty , the 2-@xmath80 range is @xmath144 . \n the bold face entries in column ( 2 ) of tables 912 indicates those model - parameter values which predict an @xmath2 inconsistent with this range . \n comparison of the standard nucleosynthesis theoretical predictions for the primordial light element abundances to what is determined by extrapolation of the observed abundances to primordial values leads to constraints on @xmath63 . \n it has usually been argued that @xmath145he and @xmath146li allow for the most straightforward extrapolation from the locally observed abundances to the primordial values ( e.g. , dar 1995 ; fields &  olive 1996 ; fields et al . \n 1996 , hereafter fkot ) . \n the observed @xmath145he and @xmath146li abundances then suggest @xmath147 , and a conservative assessment of the uncertainties indicate a 2-@xmath80 range : @xmath148 ( fkot ; also see copi et al . \n 1995 ; sarkar 1996 ) . \n observational constraints on the primordial deuterium ( d ) abundance should , in principle , allow for a tightening of the allowed @xmath63 range . \n there are now a number of different estimates of the primordial d abundance , and since the field is still in its infancy it is , perhaps , not surprising that the different estimates are somewhat discrepant . \n songaila et al . \n ( 1994 ) , carswell et al . \n ( 1994 ) , and rugers &  hogan ( 1996a , b ) use observations of three high - redshift absorption clouds to argue for a high primordial d abundance and so a low @xmath63 . \n tytler , fan , &  burles ( 1996 ) and burles &  tytler ( 1996 ) study two absorption clouds and argue for a low primordial d abundance and so a high @xmath63 . \n carswell et al . ( 1996 ) and wampler et al . ( 1996 ) examine other absorption clouds , but are not able to strongly constrain @xmath63 . while the error bars on @xmath63 \n determined from these d abundance observations are somewhat asymmetric , to use these results to qualitatively pick the @xmath63 values we wish to examine we assume that the errors are gaussian ( and where needed add all uncertainties in quadrature to get the 2-@xmath80 uncertainties ) . \n the large d abundance observations suggest @xmath149 with a 2-@xmath80 range : @xmath150 ( rugers &  hogan 1996a ) . \n when these large d abundances are combined with the observed @xmath145he and @xmath146li abundances , they indicate @xmath151 , with a 2-@xmath80 range : @xmath152 ( fkot ) . \n the large d abundances are consistent with the standard interpretation of the @xmath145he and @xmath146li abundances , and with the standard model of particle physics ( with three massless neutrino species ) ; they do , however , seem to require a modification in galactic chemical evolution models to be consistent with local determinations of the d and @xmath153he abundances ( e.g. , fkot ; cardall &  fuller 1996 ) . \n the low d abundance observations favour @xmath154 with a 2-@xmath80 range : @xmath155 ( burles &  tytler 1996 ) . \n the low d abundance observations seem to be more easily accommodated in modifications of the standard model of particle physics , i.e. , they are difficult to reconcile with exactly three massless neutrino species ; alternatively they might indicate a gross , as yet unaccounted for , uncertainty in the observed @xmath145he abundance ( burles &  tytler 1996 ; cardall &  fuller 1996 ) . \n the low d abundance is approximately consistent with locally - observed d abundances , but probably requires some modification in the usual galactic chemical evolution model for @xmath146li ( burles &  tytler 1996 ; cardall &  fuller 1996 ) .    to accommodate the range of @xmath63 now under discussion \n , we compute model predictions for @xmath124 ( table 9 ) , 0.007 ( table 12 ) , 0.0125 ( table 10 ) , and 0.0205 ( table 11 ) . \n we shall find that this uncertainty in @xmath63 precludes determination of robust constraints on model - parameter values . \n fortunately , recent improvements in observational capabilities should eventually lead to a tightening of the constraints on @xmath63 , and so allow for tighter constraints on the other cosmological parameters . \n column ( 3 ) of tables 912 give the cosmological baryonic - mass fraction for the models we consider here . \n the cluster baryonic - mass fraction is the sum of the cluster galactic - mass and gas - mass fractions . assuming that the white et al . \n ( 1993 ) 1-@xmath80 uncertainties on the cluster total , galactic , and gas masses are gaussian and adding them in quadrature , we find for the 2-@xmath80 range of the cluster baryonic - mass fraction : @xmath156 elbaz , arnaud , &  bhringer ( 1995 ) , white &  fabian ( 1995 ) , david , jones , &  forman ( 1995 ) , markevitch et al . \n ( 1996 ) , and buote &  canizares ( 1996 ) find similar ( or larger ) gas - mass fractions . \n note that elbaz et al . \n ( 1995 ) and white &  fabian ( 1995 ) find that the gas - mass error bars are somewhat asymmetric ; this non - gaussianity is ignored here . assuming that the cluster baryonic - mass fraction is an unbiased estimate of the cosmological baryonic - mass fraction , we may use eq . \n ( 15 ) to constrain the cosmological parameters . \n the boldface entries in column ( 3 ) of tables 9 - 12 indicates those model - parameter values which predict a cosmological baryonic - mass fraction inconsistent with the range of eq . ( 15 ) . \n viana &  liddle ( 1996 , hereafter vl ) have reanalyzed the combined galaxy @xmath58 data of peacock &  dodds ( 1994 ) , ignoring some of the smaller scale data where nonlinear effects might be somewhat larger than previously suspected . \n using an analytic approximation to the @xmath58 , they estimate that the scaling parameter ( eq . [ 13 ] ) in the exponent of eq . \n ( 13 ) , so the numerical values of their constraint on @xmath157 should be reduced slightly . \n we ignore this small effect here . ] \n @xmath158 , with a 2-@xmath80 range , @xmath159 this estimate is consistent with earlier ones than eq . \n ( 16 )  this is one reason why llrv favour a higher @xmath1 for the open - bubble inflation model than do grsb . ] . \n it might be of interest to determine whether the wiggles in @xmath58 due to the pressure in the photon - baryon fluid , see figs . \n 23 , can significantly affect the determination of @xmath157 , especially in large @xmath119 models . \n ( these wiggles are not well described by the analytic approximation to @xmath58 . ) the boldface entries in column ( 4 ) of tables 912 indicates those model - parameter values which predict a scaling parameter value inconsistent with the range of eq . \n ( 16 ) .    to determine the value of the linear bias parameter @xmath160 , @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the rms fractional perturbation in galaxy number \n , we adopt the apm value ( maddox , efstathiou , &  sutherland 1996 ) of @xmath163 = 0.96 $ ] , with 2-@xmath80 range : @xmath164 where we have added the uncertainty due to the assumed cosmological model and due to the assumed evolution in quadrature with the statistical 1-@xmath80 uncertainty ( maddox et al . \n 1996 , eq . [ 43 ] ) , and doubled to get the 2-@xmath80 uncertainty . the range of eq . \n ( 18 ) is consistent with that determined from eqs . \n ( 7.33 ) and ( 7.73 ) of peebles ( 1993 ) .    the local abundance of rich clusters , as a function of their x - ray temperature , provides a tight constraint on @xmath113 $ ] . \n eke , cole , &  frenk ( 1996 , hereafter ecf ) ( and s. cole , private communication 1996 ) find for the open model at 2-@xmath80 : @xmath165 where we have assumed that the ecf uncertainties are gaussian , and that in general it depends weakly on the value of @xmath157 ( and so on the value of @xmath2 and @xmath10 )  see fig . \n 13 of ecf . in our preliminary analysis here \n we ignore this mild dependence on @xmath2 and @xmath10 . \n also note that the constraint of eq . \n ( 19 ) is approximately that required for consistency with the observed cluster correlation function . ] \n . the constraints of eq . \n ( 19 ) are consistent with , but more restrictive than , those derived by vl = 0.60 $ ] for fiducial cdm , which is at the @xmath1662-@xmath80 limit of eq . \n ( as discussed in ecf , this is because vl normalize to the cluster temperature function at 7 kev , where there is a rise in the temperature function . ) \n this is one reason why llrv favour a higher value of @xmath1 for the open - bubble inflation model than did grsb . ] . \n this is because ecf use observational data over a larger range in x - ray temperature to constrain @xmath167 , and also use n - body computations at @xmath168 0.3 and 1 to calibrate the press - schechter model ( which is used in their determination of the constraints ) . \n furthermore , ecf also make use of hydrodynamical simulations of a handful of individual clusters in the fiducial cdm model ( @xmath69 ) to calibrate the relation between the gas temperature and the cluster mass , and then use this calibrated relation for the computations at all values of @xmath1 . \n the initial conditions for all the simulations were set using the analytical approximation to @xmath58 , so again it might be of interest to see whether the wiggles in the numerically integrated @xmath58 could significantly affect the determination of the constraints of eq . \n kitayama &  suto ( 1996 ) use x - ray cluster data , and a method that allows for the fact that clusters need not have formed at the redshift at which they are observed , to directly constrain the value of @xmath1 for cdm cosmogonies normalized by the dmr two - year data . \n their conclusions are in resonable accord with what would be found by using eq . \n ( 19 ) ( derived assuming that observed clusters are at their redshifts of formation ) . \n however , kitayama &  suto ( 1996 ) note that evolution from the redshift of formation to the redshift of observation can affect the conclusions , so a more careful comparison of these two results is warranted . the boldface entries in columns ( 6 ) and ( 9 ) of tables 912 indicate those model - parameter values whose predictions are inconsistent with the constraints of eq . \n ( 19 ) ( 1-@xmath80 ) uncertainty of eq . \n ( 19 ) , approximate analyses based on using the analytic bbks approximation to the transfer function should make use of the more accurate parameterization of eq . \n ( 13 ) ( rather than that with @xmath169 in the exponent ) , as this gives @xmath26 $ ] to better than @xmath87 in the observationally viable part of parameter space ( provided use is made of the numerically determined values of @xmath42 ) . ] .    from large - scale peculiar velocity observational data zaroubi et al . \n ( 1996 ) estimate @xmath26 = ( 0.85 \\pm 0.2)\\omega_0{}^{-0.6}$ ] ( 2-@xmath80 ) \n . it might be significant that the large - scale peculiar velocity observational data constraint is somewhat discordant with ( higher than ) the cluster temperature function constraint . \n since @xmath170 is less sensitive to smaller length scales ( compared to @xmath26 $ ] ) , observational constraints on @xmath170 are more reliably contrasted with the linear theory predictions . however , since @xmath170 is sensitive to larger length scales , the observational constraints on @xmath170 are significantly less restrictive than the @xmath171 ( 1-@xmath80 ) constraints of eq . \n ( 19 ) , and so we do not record the predicted values of @xmath170 here . \n observational constraints on the mass power spectrum determined from large - scale peculiar velocity observations provide another constraint on the mass fluctuations . \n kolatt &  dekel ( 1995 ) find at the 1-@xmath80 level @xmath172 where the 1-@xmath80 uncertainty also accounts for sample variance ( t. kolatt , private communication 1996 ) . since the uncertainties associated with the constraint of eq . \n ( 19 ) are more restrictive than those associated with the constraint of eq . \n ( 20 ) , we do not tabulate predictions for this quantity here . \n however , comparison may be made to the predicted linear theory mass power spectra of figs . \n 23 , bearing in mind the @xmath173 ( 2-@xmath80 ) uncertainty of eq . \n ( 20 ) ( the uncertainty is approximately gaussian , t. kolatt , private communication 1996),-@xmath80 , significance level , eq . ( 20 ) provides a strong upper limit on @xmath174 , especially at larger @xmath1 because of the @xmath1 dependence . ] and the uncertainty in the dmr normalization ( not shown in figs . \n 23 ) .    columns ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) of tables 912 give the dmr - normalized model predictions for @xmath134 ( eq . [ 14 ] ) . \n cole , fisher , &  weinberg ( 1995 ) measure the anisotropy of the redshift space power spectrum of the @xmath133 1.2 jy survey and conclude @xmath175 with a 2-@xmath80 c.l . \n range : @xmath176 where we have doubled the error bars of eq . \n ( 5.1 ) of cole et al . \n ( 1995 ) to get the 2-@xmath80 range . \n cole et al . \n ( 1995 , table 1 ) compare the estimate of eq . \n ( 21 ) to other estimates of @xmath134 , and at 2-@xmath80 all estimates of @xmath134 are consistent . it should be noted that the model predictions of @xmath134 ( eq . \n [ 14 ] ) in tables 912 assume that for @xmath133 galaxies @xmath163 = 1/1.3 $ ] holds exactly , i.e. , they ignore the uncertainty in the rms fractional perturbation in @xmath133 galaxy number , which is presumably of the order of that in eq . ( 18 ) . as the constraints from the deduced @xmath134 values , eq . \n ( 21 ) , are not yet as restrictive as those from other large - scale structure measures , we do not pursue this issue in our analysis here . \n the boldface entries in columns ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) of tables 912 indicate those model - parameter values whose predictions are inconsistent with the constraints of eq . \n ( 21 ) .      the boldface entries in tables \n 912 summarize the current constraints imposed by the observational data discussed in the previous section on the model - parameter values for the open - bubble inflation model ( spectra of type [ 1 ] above ) , and for the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model ( type [ 4 ] above ) . \n the current observational constraints on the models are not dissimilar , but this is mostly a reflection of the uncertainty on the constraints themselves since the model predictions are fairly different .    in the following discussion of the preferred part of model - parameter space \n we focus on the open - bubble inflation model ( rp94 ) . \n note from table 13 that the large - scale structure predictions of the open - bubble inflation model do not depend on perturbations generated in the first epoch of inflation ( bgt ; yst ) , and also do not depend significantly on the contribution from the non - square - integrable basis function ( yst ) . \n table 9 corresponds to the part of parameter space with  maximized \" small - scale power in matter fluctuations . \n this is accomplished by picking a low @xmath123 gyr ( and so large @xmath2 ) , and by picking a low @xmath124 ( this is the lower 2-@xmath80 limit from standard nucleosynthesis and the observed @xmath145he , @xmath146li , and high d abundances , fkot ) . \n the tightest constraints on the model - parameter values come from the matter power spectrum observational data constraints on the shape parameter @xmath157 ( table 9 , col . \n [ 4 ] ) , and from the cluster x - ray temperature function observational data constraints on @xmath26 $ ] ( col . \n note that for @xmath177 the predicted upper 2-@xmath80 value of @xmath113 = 0.69 $ ] , while ecf conclude that at 2-@xmath80 the observational data requires that this be at least 0.74 , so an @xmath177 case fails this test . \n the constraints on @xmath134 ( col . \n [ 7 ] ) are not as restrictive as those on @xmath113 $ ] . for these values of @xmath62 and @xmath178 the cosmological baryonic - mass fraction at @xmath177 \n is predicted to be 0.033 ( col . [ 3 ] ) , while at 2-@xmath80 white et al . \n ( 1993 ) require that this be at least 0.039 ( at @xmath179 ) , so again this @xmath177 model just fails this test . \n given the observational uncertainties , it might be possible to make minor adjustments to model - parameter values so that an @xmath180 model with @xmath181 gyr and @xmath182 is just consistent with the observational data . \n however , it is clear that current observational data do not favour an open model with @xmath183  the observed cluster @xmath184 $ ] favours a larger @xmath1 while the observed cluster baryonic - mass fraction favours a smaller @xmath1 , and so are in conflict . \n table 10 gives the predictions for the @xmath121 gyr , @xmath185 models . \n this value of @xmath63 is consistent with the 2-@xmath80 range determined from standard nucleosynthesis and the observed @xmath145he and @xmath146li abundances : @xmath148 ( fkot , also see copi et al . \n 1995 ; sarkar 1996 ) . \n it is , however , somewhat difficult to reconcile @xmath8 with the 2-@xmath80 range derived from the observed @xmath145he , @xmath146li , and current high d abundances @xmath152 ( fkot ) , or with that from the current observed low d abundances @xmath186 ( burles &  tytler 1996 ) . in any case , the observed d abundances are still under discussion , and must be viewed as preliminary . in this case , open - bubble inflation models with @xmath187 are consistent with the observational constraints . \n the current central observational data values for @xmath157 and @xmath134 favour @xmath74 , while that for the cluster baryonic - mass fraction prefers @xmath188 , and that for @xmath130 $ ] favours @xmath189 , so in this case the agreement between predictions and observational data is fairly impressive ( although the tanvir et al . \n 1995 central @xmath2 value favours @xmath190 ) . \n note that in this case models with @xmath191 are quite inconsistent with the data . \n table 11 gives the predictions for @xmath192 gyr , @xmath193 models . \n this baryonic - mass density value is consistent with that determined from the current observed low d abundances , but is difficult to reconcile with the current standard nucleosynthesis interpretation of the observed @xmath145he and @xmath146li abundances ( cardall &  fuller 1996 ) . \n the larger value of @xmath63 ( and smaller value of @xmath2 ) has now lowered small - scale power in mass fluctuations somewhat significantly , opening up the allowed @xmath1 range to larger values . \n models with @xmath194 are consistent with the observational data , although the higher @xmath1 part of the range is starting to conflict with what is determined from the small - scale dynamical estimates , and the models do require a somewhat low @xmath2 ( but not yet inconsistently so at the 2-@xmath80 significance level  while the tanvir et al . \n 1995 central @xmath2 value requires @xmath100 , at 2-@xmath80 the @xmath2 constraint only requires @xmath195 ) . \n the central observational values for @xmath157 , the cluster baryonic - mass fraction , @xmath26 $ ] , and @xmath134 favour @xmath97 , so the agreement with observational data is fairly impressive , and could even be improved by reducing @xmath62 a little to raise @xmath2 . \n table 12 gives the predictions for another part of model - parameter space . \n here we show @xmath122 models ( at @xmath121 gyr ) , consistent with the central value of @xmath63 determined from standard nucleosynthesis using the observed @xmath145he , @xmath146li , and high d abundances ( fkot ) . \n the larger value of @xmath63 ( compared to table 9 ) eases the cluster baryonic - mass fraction constraint , which now requires only @xmath196 . \n the increase in @xmath63 also decreases the mass fluctuation amplitude , making it more difficult to argue for @xmath177 ; however , models with @xmath197 seem to be consistent with the observational constraints when @xmath4 and @xmath198 gyr . \n it is interesting that in this case the central observational data values we consider for @xmath157 , for @xmath26 $ ] , and for @xmath134 prefer @xmath9 ; however , that for the cluster baryonic - mass fraction ( as well as that for @xmath2 ) favours @xmath190 ( although at 2-@xmath80 the cluster baryonic - mass fraction constraint only requires @xmath196 ) . hence , while @xmath199 open - bubble inflation models with @xmath200 and @xmath198 gyr are quite consistent with the observational constraints , in this case the agreement between predictions and observations is not spectacular . \n note that in this case models with @xmath201 are quite inconsistent with the observational data .    in summary , \n open - bubble inflation models based on the cdm picture ( rp94 ; bgt ; yst ) are reasonably consistent with current observational data provided @xmath202 . \n the flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open model ( w83 ) is also reasonably compatible with current observational constraints for a similar range of @xmath1 . \n the uncertainty in current estimates of @xmath63 is one of the major reasons why such a large range in @xmath1 is consistent with current observational constraints \n .    our previous analysis of the dmr two - year data led us to conclude that only those open - bubble inflation models near the lower end of the above range ( @xmath203 ) were consistent with the majority of observations ( grsb ) . \n the increase in the allowed range to higher @xmath1 values @xmath204 can be ascribed to a number of small effects . \n specifically , these are : ( 1 ) the slight downward shift in the central value of the dmr four - year normalization relative to the two - year one ( g96 ) ; ( 2 ) use of the full 2-@xmath80 range of normalizations allowed by the dmr data analysis ( instead of the 1-@xmath80 range allowed by the galactic - frame quadrupole - excluded dmr two - year data set used previously ) ; ( 3 ) use of the 2-@xmath80 range of the small - scale dynamical estimates of @xmath1 instead of the 1-@xmath80 range used in our earlier analysis ; ( 4 ) we consider a range of @xmath63 values here ( in grsb we focussed on @xmath8 ) ; and ( 5 ) we consider a range of @xmath62 values here ( in grsb we concentrated on @xmath121 gyr ) . \n we emphasize , however , that the part of parameter space with @xmath205 is only favoured if @xmath63 is large ( @xmath206 ) , @xmath2 is low @xmath207 ) , and the small - scale dynamical estimates of @xmath1 turn out to be biased somewhat low . \n the observational results we have used to constrain model - parameter values in the previous sections are the most robust currently available . \n in addition , there are several other observational results which we do not consider to be as robust , and any conclusions drawn from these should be treated with due caution . in this section \n we summarize several of the more tentative constraints from more recent observations .    in our analysis of the dmr two - year data normalized models , we compared model predictions for the rms value of the smoothed peculiar velocity field to results from the analysis of observational data ( bertschinger et al . \n we do not do so again here since , given the uncertainties , the conclusions drawn in grsb are not significantly modified . \n in particular , comparison of the appropriate quantities implies that we can treat the old 1-@xmath80 upper limits essentially as 2-@xmath80 upper limits for the four - year analysis .    in grsb \n we used @xmath134 determined by nusser &  davis ( 1994 ) , @xmath208 ( 2-@xmath80 ) , to constrain the allowed range of models to @xmath209 . here \n we use the cole et al . \n ( 1995 ) estimate , @xmath210 ( 2-@xmath80 ) , which , for the models of table 10 , requires @xmath211 . \n this value is just slightly below the lower limit ( @xmath212 ) derived from the bertschinger et al . \n ( 1990 ) results in grsb . \n we hence conclude that the large - scale flow results of bertschinger et al . \n ( 1990 ) indicates a lower 2-@xmath80 limit on @xmath1 that is about @xmath213 higher than that suggested by the redshift - space distortion analysis of cole et al . \n ( 1995).$ ] . ] \n we however strongly emphasize that the central value of the large - scale flow results of bertschinger et al . \n ( 1990 ) does favour a significantly larger value of @xmath1 than the rest of the data we have considered here . furthermore , as discussed in detail in grsb , there is some uncertainty in how to properly interpret large - scale velocity data in the open models , particularly given the large sample variance associated with the measurement of a single bulk velocity ( bond 1996 , also see llrv ) . \n a more careful analysis , as well as more observational data , is undoubtedly needed before it will be possible to robustly conclude that the large - scale velocity data does indeed force one to consider significantly larger values of @xmath1 than is favoured by the rest of the observational constraints ( and hence rules out the models considered here ) . \n it might be significant that on comparing the mass power spectrum deduced from a refined set of peculiar velocity observations to the galaxy power spectrum determined from the apm survey , kolatt &  dekel ( 1995 ) estimate that for the optically - selected apm galaxies @xmath214 with a 2-@xmath80 range , @xmath215 ( note that it has been argued that systematic uncertainties preclude a believable determination of @xmath134 from a comparison of the observed large - scale peculiar velocity field to the @xmath133 1.2 jy galaxy distribution , davis , nusser , &  willick 1996 . ) \n this range is consistent with other estimates now under discussion . \n the stromlo - apm comparison of loveday et al . \n ( 1996 ) indicates @xmath216 , with a 2-@xmath80 upper limit of 0.75 , while baugh ( 1996 ) concludes that @xmath217 ( 2-@xmath80 ) , and ratcliffe et al . \n ( 1996 ) argue for @xmath218 . using the apm range for @xmath163 $ ] , \n ( 18 ) , the kolatt &  dekel ( 1995 ) estimate of @xmath219 , eq . \n ( 22 ) , may be converted to an estimate of @xmath167 , and at 2-@xmath80 , @xmath220 it is interesting that at @xmath69 the lower part of this range is consistent with that determined from the cluster x - ray temperature function data , eq . ( 19 ) , although at lower @xmath1 eq . \n ( 23 ) indicates a larger value then does eq . \n ( 19 ) because of the steeper rise to low @xmath1 . \n zaroubi et al . \n ( 1996 ) have constrained model - parameter values by comparing large - scale flow observations to that predicted in the dmr two - year data normalized open - bubble inflation model . \n they conclude that the open - bubble inflation model provides a good description of the large - scale flow observations if , at 2-@xmath80 , @xmath221 from table 12 we see that an open - bubble inflation model with @xmath222 and @xmath223 provides a good fit to all the observational data considered in @xmath224 . for @xmath223 zaroubi et al . \n ( 1996 ) conclude that at 2-@xmath80 @xmath225 ( eq . [ 24 ] ) , just above our value of @xmath222 . since the zaroubi et al . \n ( 1996 ) analysis does not account for the uncertainty in the dmr normalization ( t. kolatt , private communication 1996 ) , it is still unclear if the constraints from the large - scale flow observations are in conflict with those determined from the other data considered here ( and so rule out the open - bubble inflation model ) \n . it might also be significant that on somewhat smaller length scales there is support for a smaller value of @xmath1 from large - scale velocity field data ( shaya , peebles , &  tully 1995 ) . \n the cluster peculiar velocity function provides an alternate mechanism for probing the peculiar velocity field ( e.g. , croft &  efstathiou 1994 ; moscardini et al . \n 1995 ; bahcall &  oh 1996 ) . \n bahcall &  oh ( 1996 ) conclude that current observational data is well - described by an @xmath177 flat-@xmath18 model with @xmath226 and @xmath227 = 0.67 $ ] . \n this normalization is somewhat smaller than that indicated by the dmr data ( e.g. , ratra &  sugiyama 1995 ) . \n while bahcall &  oh ( 1996 ) did not compare the cluster peculiar velocity function data to the predictions of the open - bubble inflation model , approximate estimates indicate that this data is consistent with the open - bubble inflation model predictions for the range of @xmath1 favoured by the other data we consider in @xmath228  see the @xmath26 $ ] values for the allowed models in tables 912 . \n bahcall &  oh ( 1996 ) also note that it is difficult , if not impossible , to reconcile the cluster peculiar velocity observations with what is predicted in high density models like fiducial cdm and mdm .    at fixed @xmath113 $ ] , \n low - density cosmogonies form structure earlier than high density ones . \n thus observations of structure at high redshift may be used to constrain the matter density . as benchmarks \n , we note that scaling from the results of the numerical simulations of cen &  ostriker ( 1993 ) , in a open model with @xmath229 = 0.8 $ ] galaxy formation peaks at a redshift @xmath230 when @xmath231 and at @xmath232 when @xmath72 . \n thus the open - bubble inflation model is not in conflict with observational indications that the giant elliptical luminosity function at @xmath233 is similar to that at the present ( e.g. , lilly et al . \n 1995 ; glazebrook et al . 1995 ; i m et al . \n 1996 ) , nor is it in conflict with observational evidence for massive galactic disks at @xmath233 ( vogt et al . \n these models can also accommodate observational evidence of massive star - forming galaxies at @xmath234 ( cowie , hu , &  songaila 1995 ) , as well as the significant peak at @xmath235 in the number of galaxies as a function of ( photometric ) redshift found in the hubble deep field ( gwyn &  hartwick 1996 ) , and it is not inconceivable that objects like the @xmath236  protogalaxy \" candidate ( yee et al . \n 1996 ; ellingson et al . \n 1996 ) can be produced in these models . \n it is , however , at present unclear whether the open - bubble inflation model can accommodate a substantial population of massive star - forming galaxies at @xmath237 ( steidel et al . \n 1996 ; giavalisco , steidel , &  macchetto 1996 ) , and if there are many more examples of massive damped lyman@xmath238 systems like the one at @xmath239 ( e.g. , lu et al . \n 1996 ; wampler et al . 1996 ; fontana et al . \n 1996 ) , then , depending on the masses , these might be a serious problem for the open - bubble inflation model . \n on the other hand , the recent discovery of galaxy groups at @xmath240 ( e.g. , francis et al . 1996 ; pascarelle et al . 1996 ) probably do not pose a serious threat for the open - bubble inflation model , while massive clusters at @xmath241 ( e.g. , luppino &  gioia 1995 ; pell et al . \n 1996 ) can easily be accommodated in the model . \n it should be noted that in adiabatic @xmath69 models normalized to fit the present small - scale observations , e.g. , fiducial cdm ( with a normalization inconsistent with that from the dmr ) , or mdm , or tilted cdm ( without a cosmological constant ) , it is quite difficult , if not impossible , to accommodate the above observational indications of early structure formation ( e.g. , ma &  bertschinger 1994 ; ostriker &  cen 1996 ) .    with the recent improvements in observational capabilities , neoclassical cosmological tests hold great promise for constraining the world model . \n it might be significant that current constraints from these tests are consistent with that region of the open - bubble inflation model parameter space that is favoured by the large - scale structure constraints . \n these tests include the @xmath142 elliptical galaxy number counts test ( driver et al . 1996 ) , an early application of the apparent magnitude - redshift test using type ia supernovae ( perlmutter et al . 1996 ) , as well as analyses of the rate of gravitational lensing of quasars by foreground galaxies ( e.g. , torres &   waga 1996 ; kochanek 1996 ) . \n it should be noted that these tests are also consistent with @xmath69 models , and plausibly with a time - variable cosmological  constant \" dominated spatially - flat model ( e.g. , ratra &   quillen 1992 ; torres &  waga 1996 ) , but they do put pressure on the flat-@xmath18 cdm model . \n smaller - scale cmb spatial anisotropy measurements will eventually significantly constrain the allowed range of model - parameter values . fig . \n 24 compares the 1-@xmath80 range of cmb spatial anisotropy predictions for a few representative open - bubble inflation ( as well as flat - space scale - invariant spectrum open ) models to available cmb spatial anisotropy observational data . from a preliminary comparison of the predictions of dmr two - year data \n normalized open - bubble inflation models to available cmb anisotropy observational data , ratra et al . \n ( 1995 ) concluded that the range of parameter space for the open - bubble inflation model that was favoured by the other observational data was also consistent with the small - scale cmb anisotropy data . \n this result was quantified by grs , who also considered open - bubble inflation models normalized to the @xmath1351-@xmath80 values of the dmr two - year data ( and hence considered open - bubble inflation models normalized at close to the dmr four - year data value , see figs . 5 and 6 of grs ) . \n grs discovered that ( given the uncertainties associated with the smaller - scale measurements ) the 1-@xmath80 uncertainty in the value of the dmr normalization precludes determination of robust constraints on model - parameter values , although the range of model - parameter space for the open - bubble inflation model favoured by the analysis here was found to be consistent with the smaller - scale cmb anisotropy observations , and @xmath93 open - bubble inflation models were not favoured by the smaller - scale cmb anisotropy observational data ( grs , figs \n . 5 and 6 ) . is favoured , but even at 1-@xmath80 @xmath242 is allowed  this broad range is consistent with the conclusion of grs that it is not yet possible to meaningfully constrain cosmological - parameter values from the cmb anisotropy data alone . \n note also that hancock et al . \n ( 1996b ) do not consider the effects of the systematic shifts between the various dmr data sets , and also exclude a number of data points , e.g. , the four msam points and the max3 mup point ( which is consistent with the recent max5 mup result , lim et al . 1996 ) , which do not disfavour a lower value of @xmath1 for the open - bubble inflation model ( ratra et al . \n 1995 ; grs ) . ] a detailed analysis of the ucsb south pole 1994 cmb anisotropy data ( gundersen et al . \n 1995 ) by ganga et al . \n ( 1996a ) reaches a similar conclusion : at 1-@xmath80 ( assuming a gaussian marginal probability distribution ) the data favours open - bubble inflation models with @xmath243 , while at 2-@xmath80 the ucsb south pole 1994 data is consistent with the predictions of the open - bubble , flat-@xmath18 , and fiducial cdm inflation models . \n we have compared the dmr 53 and 90 ghz sky maps to a variety of open model cmb anisotropy angular spectra in order to infer the normalization of these open cosmogonical models . \n our analysis explicitly quantifies the small shifts in the inferred normalization amplitudes due to : ( 1 ) the small differences between the galactic- and ecliptic - coordinate sky maps ; ( 2 ) the inclusion or exclusion of the @xmath85 moment in the analysis ; and , ( 3 ) the faint high - latitude galactic emission treatment . \n we have defined a maximal 2-@xmath80 uncertainty range based on the extremal solutions of the normalization fits , and a maximal 1-@xmath80 uncertainty range may be defined in a similar manner . for this \n maximal 1-@xmath80 @xmath21 range the fractional 1-@xmath80 uncertainty , at fixed @xmath10 and @xmath2 ( but depending on the assumed cmb anisotropy angular spectrum and model - parameter values ) , ranges between @xmath244 and @xmath245 ( statistical and systematic ) uncertainty of bw ( footnote 4 , also see bunn , liddle , &  white 1996 ) , @xmath246 , is smaller than the dmr four - year data 1-@xmath80 uncertainty estimated in , e.g. , g96 , wright et al . \n ( 1996 ) , and here . \n this is because we explicitly estimate the effect of all known systematic uncertainties for each assumed cmb anisotropy angular spectrum , and account for them , in the most conservative manner possible , as small shifts . \n ( in particular : we do not just account for the small systematic difference between the galactic- and ecliptic - frame maps ; we do not assume that any of the small systematic differences lead to model - independent systematic shifts in the inferred @xmath21 values ; and we do not add the systematic shifts in quadrature with the statistical uncertainty . ) \n since our accounting of the uncertainties is the most conservative possible , our conclusions about model - viability are the most robust possible . ] . \n ( compare this to the @xmath247 , 1-@xmath80 , uncertainty of eq . \n [ 19 ] . ) since part of this uncertainty is due to the small systematic shifts , the maximal 2-@xmath80 fractional uncertainty is smaller than twice the maximal 1-@xmath80 fractional uncertainty . \n for the largest possible 2-@xmath80 @xmath21 range defined above , the fractional uncertainty varies between @xmath248 and @xmath249 . \n note that this accounts for intrinsic noise , cosmic variance , and effects ( 1)(3 ) above . \n other systematic effects , e.g. , the calibration uncertainty ( kogut et al . \n 1996b ) , or the beamwidth uncertainty ( wright et al . 1994 ) , are much smaller than the effects we have accounted for here . \n it has also been shown that there is negligible non - cmb contribution to the dmr data sets from known extragalactic astrophysical foregrounds ( banday et al . \n 1996b ) . \n by analyzing the dmr maps using cmb anisotropy spectra at fixed @xmath1 but different @xmath2 and @xmath10 , we have also explicitly quantified the small shifts in the inferred normalization amplitude due to shifts in @xmath2 and @xmath10 . \n although these shifts do depend on the value of @xmath1 and the assumed model power spectrum , given the other uncertainties , it is reasonable to ignore these small shifts when normalizing the models considered in this work . \n we have analyzed the open - bubble inflation model , accounting only for the fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble ( rp94 ) , including the effects of the fluctuations generated in the first epoch of spatially - flat inflation ( bgt ; yst ) , and finally accounting for the contribution from a non - square - integrable basis function ( yst ) . for observationally viable open - bubble models , \n the observable predictions do not depend significantly on the latter two sources of anisotropy . \n the observable predictions of the open - bubble inflation scenario seem to be robust  it seems that only those fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble need to be accounted for . \n as discussed in the introduction , a variety of more specific realizations of the open - bubble inflation scenario have recently come under scrutiny . \n these are based on specific assumptions about the vacuum state prior to open - bubble nucleation . in these specific realizations of the open - bubble inflation scenario \n there are a number of additional mechanisms for stress - energy perturbation generation ( in addition to those in the models considered here ) , including those that come from fluctuations in the bubble wall , as well as effects associated with the nucleation of a nonzero size bubble . \n while current analyses suggest that such effects also do not add a significant amount to the fluctuations generated during the evolution inside the bubble , it is important to continue to pursue such investigations  both to more carefully examine the robustness of the open - bubble inflation scenario predictions , as well as to try to find a reasonable particle physics based realization of the open - bubble inflation scenario .    as has been previously noted for other cmb anisotropy angular spectra ( g96 ) , the various different dmr data sets lead to slightly different @xmath21 normalization amplitudes , but well within the statistical uncertainty . \n this total range is slightly reduced if one considers results from analyses either ignoring or including the quadrupole moment . \n the dmr data alone can not be used to constrain @xmath1 over range @xmath14 in a statistically meaningful fashion for the open models considered here . \n it is , however , reasonable to conclude that when the quadrupole moment is excluded from the analysis , the @xmath9 model cmb anisotropy spectral shape is most consistent with the dmr data , while the quadrupole - included analysis favours @xmath12 ( for the open - bubble inflation model in the range @xmath250 ) . \n current cosmographic observations , in conjunction with current large - scale structure observations compared to the predictions of the dmr - normalized open - bubble inflation model derived here , favour @xmath202 . \n the large allowed range is partially a consequence of the current uncertainty in @xmath10 . \n this range is consistent with the value weakly favoured ( @xmath9 ) by a quadrupole - excluded analysis of the dmr data alone . \n it might also be significant that mild bias is indicated both by the need to reconcile these larger values of @xmath1 with what is determined from small - scale dynamical estimates , as well as to reconcile the smaller dmr - normalized @xmath251 $ ] values ( for this favoured range of @xmath1 ) with the larger observed galaxy number fluctuations ( e.g. , eq . [ 18 ] ) .    in common with the low - density flat-@xmath18 cdm model \n , we have established that in the low - density open - bubble cdm model one may adjust the value of @xmath1 to accommodate a large fraction of present observational constraints . for a broad class of these models , with adiabatic gaussian initial energy - density perturbations , this focuses attention on values of @xmath1 that are larger than the range of values for @xmath10 inferred from the observed light - element abundances in conjunction with standard nucleosynthesis theory . whether this additional cdm is nonbaryonic , or is simply baryonic material that does not take part in standard nucleosynthesis , remains a major outstanding puzzle for these models . \n we acknowledge the efforts of those contributing to the @xmath0-dmr . \n @xmath0 is supported by the office of space sciences of nasa headquarters . \n we also acknowledge the advice and assistance of c. baugh , s. cole , j. garriga , t. kolatt , c. park , l. piccirillo , g. rocha , g. tucker , d. weinberg , and k. yamamoto . \n rs is supported in part by a pparc grant and kbn grant 2p30401607 . \n 1.fractional differences , @xmath253 , between the cmb spatial anisotropy multipole coefficients @xmath56 computed using the two boltzmann transfer codes ( and normalized to agree at @xmath254 ) . \n heavy type is for the open -

anisotropy signal , and so gives a somewhat misleading impression of the multipoles to which the experiment is sensitive  see ganga et al . \n 1996a for a discussion of this issue ) . excluding the dmr points at @xmath303 , the horizontal lines on the observational data points represent the @xmath66-space width of the corresponding window function ( again ignoring the form of the sky - anisotropy signal ) . \n note that from an analysis of a large fraction of the data ( corresponding to detections of cmb anisotropy ) shown in these figures , grs ( figs . 5 and 6 ) conclude that all the models shown in panel ( a ) , including the fiducial cdm one , are consistent with the cmb anisotropy data .",
        "abstract":  "The text explores quantum mechanical fluctuations during inflation as a mechanism for generating energy-density perturbations that are responsible for the observed large-scale structure of the universe. Initially focusing on nearly flat universe models due to a large number of inflationary foldings, recent attention has shifted to models allowing for open spatial hypersurfaces, incorporating a cosmological constant to reconcile theoretical models with observational data. Various inflationary models, including the open-bubble inflation model, are examined for their consistency with cosmic microwave background anisotropies and galaxy distributions. This analysis involves normalization techniques and statistical evaluations to align theoretical predictions with empirical data."

        "article": "formation and bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of molecules @xcite have recently been achieved based on ultracold atoms with magnetically - tuned feshbach resonances @xcite . in these experiments , \n feshbach coupling is induced by tuning a foreign molecular state near the scattering continuum , which allows for an efficient transfer of colliding atoms into molecules . \n this method works for virtually all alkali atoms , and can create ultracold molecules from various sources including bose condensates @xcite , degenerate fermi gases @xcite , or normal thermal gases @xcite . \n feshbach molecules have special and unique properties . \n they typically populate only one weakly - bound quantum state , and the bound state can strongly couple to the scattering continuum via feshbach resonance . \n we may ask the following question : should feshbach molecules rather be considered as molecules in a specific rovibrational state or as pairs of scattering atoms near the continuum ? \n this distinction is particularly crucial in the studies of the bec to bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer state ) crossover in degenerate fermi gases , which call for a clarification of the quantum nature of the feshbach molecules @xcite . \n molecular states near feshbach resonances have been recently investigated based on sophisticated and complete two - body or many - body theory @xcite and multi - channel scattering calculations @xcite . \n all works suggest that the feshbach molecule is generally a coherent mixture of the foreign molecule in the closed channel and long - range atom pair in the open scattering channel . near resonances with large resonance widths , \n the molecules can be well approximated as pairs in the open channel . for narrow resonances , as suggested by numerical calculation @xcite , the closed channel dominates and a short - range molecule picture is appropriate .    in this paper \n , we use a simple two - channel model to describe two interacting atoms near a feshbach resonance ( sec . \n ii ) . to account for the finite interaction range of real atoms , \n we introduce a spherical box potential , which allows us to analytically calculate the molecular bound state in different regimes and their threshold behavior ( sec . \n iii and sec . \n iv ) . finally , we apply our model to feshbach molecules in recent fermi gas experiments and to characterize the associated feshbach resonances ( sec . \n we model the interaction of two identical , ultracold atoms with mass @xmath0 based on an open channel @xmath1 that supports the scattering continuum and a closed channel @xmath2 that supports the foreign bound state . \n the wave function of the atoms is generally expressed as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the amplitudes in the open and closed channels , respectively , and @xmath6 is the inter - atomic separation . \n we assume the interaction @xmath7 is described by a spherical box potential with an interaction range of @xmath8 , see fig . \n ( 1 ) . for @xmath9 , \n the potential energy of the open channel is 0 and the closed channel @xmath10 . for @xmath11 , the open ( closed ) channel \n has an attractive potential of @xmath12 @xmath13 , and a coupling term @xmath14 between the channels . \n the wave function satisfies the schrdinger equation :    @xmath15    . \n a bound state with energy @xmath16 relative to the scattering continuum is supported by the closed channel.,width=211 ]    the solution of the above equation for zero scattering energy @xmath17 can be expressed as :    @xmath18    where the scattering length @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constants , @xmath21 are the \n eigen wave numbers \" for @xmath11 associated with the eigen states    @xmath22 . \n based on the boundary conditions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we get    @xmath25    the latter equation shows how in general , each channel contributes to the scattering length .    in cold atom systems , \n feshbach resonances are , in most cases , induced by hyperfine interactions or spin - spin interactions . \n both interactions are many orders of magnitude weaker than the relevant short range exchange potential . \n it is an excellent approximation to assume @xmath26 and @xmath27 . \n hence , we have @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in this limit , \n the closed channel contribution is significant only when the foreign state is close to the continuum , in which case the last term in eq . \n ( 7 ) diverges . \n given the energy of the closed channel state as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the boundary condition @xmath33 allows us to expand the last term in eq . \n ( 7 ) as @xmath34 . here \n @xmath35 characterizes the feshbach coupling strength . to the same order of expansion , the middle term in eq . \n ( 7 ) is a constant across the resonance and can be identified as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the background scattering length . \n equation ( 7 ) reduces to    @xmath38 \n experimentally , the relative energy between the continuum and the bare state can be adjusted linearly by a magnetic field @xmath39-induced zeeman shift @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the magnetic moment of the open(closed ) channel . \n replacing @xmath16 by @xmath43 , we can rewrite eq . \n ( 8) in terms of the magnetic field as    @xmath44    where the resonance width @xmath45 and the resonance position @xmath46 are given by    @xmath47    several interesting features are shown here . \n first of all , we find the resonance width is proportional to both the feshbach coupling @xmath48 and the background scattering properties @xmath49 . \n the latter dependence is due to the fact that the scattering amplitude at short range is proportional to the scattering length . \n a larger short range scattering amplitude leads to a stronger coupling to the closed channel . \n secondly and importantly , the resonance position is offset by exactly @xmath45 relative to the crossing of the bare state and the continuum , @xmath50 , see eq .  ( 11 ) . for a positive scattering length @xmath51 , \n this shift is negative @xmath52 . \n this feature leads to the  renormalization \" of the feshbach resonance location discussed in ref . \n @xcite .    to understand the origin of the resonance shift \n , we should return to eq . \n the divergence of the scattering length occurs when the open channel contribution ( middle term ) is exactly canceled by the closed channel one ( last term ) . for systems with large background scattering lengths @xmath53 and strong feshbach couplings @xmath48 , this cancelation can occur even when the bare state is far away from the continuum . \n a large resonance shift then results . \n now we turn to the binding energy of the molecules . assuming a bound eigen state @xmath54 exists near the continuum at @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the binding energy , we can determine @xmath57 by following essentially the same calculation as eq . \n ( 1)-(7 ) . \n the equivalence of eq . \n ( 7 ) gives    @xmath58    where @xmath59 . \n assuming @xmath28 and the bound states in both channels are close to the continuum , namely , @xmath53 and @xmath60 , we can expand the two terms on the right side of eq . \n ( 12 ) to leading order as @xmath36 and @xmath61 , respectively . \n equation  ( 12 ) then reduces to    @xmath62    this result shows the evolution of the eigen state near the resonance . \n similar result is obtained in ref . \n @xcite based on a contact potential . \n we can immediately see that in the absence of the feshbach coupling @xmath63 , the solutions of eq . \n ( 13 ) are @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( for @xmath51 ) , which exactly correspond to the bare bound states in the closed channel and the open channel ( for @xmath51 ) , respectively .    in the presence of the feshbach coupling @xmath66 , eq . \n ( 13 ) suggests an  avoided level crossing \"- like energy structure , see fig . \n ( 2 ) , which also illustrates the resonance position shifts . \n the level crossing , however , is not hyperbolic as it is in a two - level system . in particular , at small binding energies , the bound state energy approaches the continuum quadratically , see fig . \n ( 2 ) inset . far below the continuum , \n the bound state approaches the bare state in the closed channel .    , solid lines ) . \n we assume ( a ) @xmath67 and @xmath68 and ( b ) @xmath69 and @xmath68 , where @xmath70 can be any relevant length scale . \n arrows mark the offset resonance positions . \n insets show the threshold behavior of the bound state.,width=268 ]    to better quantify the role of the open and closed channel , we can write the wave function of the eigen state as    @xmath71    and , with our approximations , @xmath72 satisfies    @xmath73    and the mixing angle @xmath74 is defined below . \n we show in eq . \n ( 15 ) that the eigen state generally occupies both the closed channel and open channel . \n we can introduce a mixing amplitude @xmath75 as the amplitude in the closed channel    @xmath76    the mixing fraction @xmath77 can be evaluated by a direct integration of the closed channel wave function . alternatively , noticing that the mixing also leads to a dependence of the eigen state on the bare state , we can also derive @xmath77 from the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath16 , or from the magnetic moment of the feshbach molecule @xmath78 . \n all methods lead to the same result    @xmath79 \n despite the seemingly complex equations shown in previous sections , the feshbach molecules are simple and universal near the scattering continuum . \n expanding eq . \n ( 13 ) with small @xmath57 and using eq . \n ( 9)-(11 ) , we find the binding energy of the feshbach molecules has a simple dependence on the scattering length and increases quadratically in magnetic field near the resonance , namely , \n @xmath80    where @xmath81 .    equation ( 20 ) shows identical dependence on scattering length and interaction range as of single channel molecules in the threshold regime @xcite . \n furthermore , taking the limit @xmath82 in eq . \n ( 14 ) and ( 19 ) , we find the molecular wave function here is purely in the open channel . \n its spatial extent is determined by quantum uncertainty , @xmath83 , and can be much larger than the interaction range @xmath84 . in this limit , \n the feshbach molecules are identical to long - range atom pairs in a single open channel .    by expanding eq . \n ( 19 ) at small @xmath85 and using eq . \n ( 13 ) , we find the closed channel fraction can be expressed as @xmath86    where @xmath87 .    from eq . \n ( 22 ) , we see that @xmath88 provides the leading order estimation of the closed channel admixture . when @xmath89 or @xmath90 ( this condition applies when @xmath91 ) , the feshbach molecule is purely in the open channel . \n as expected , the threshold regime is wider for resonances with larger @xmath48 and @xmath92 . \n we can further determine the \n open channel -

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the formation and Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) of molecules through ultracold atoms using magnetically-tuned Feshbach resonances. The Feshbach coupling is induced by aligning a foreign molecular state near the scattering continuum, facilitating efficient atom-to-molecule conversion. This method is applicable across various alkali atoms and different atomic states, including Bose condensates, degenerate Fermi gases, and normal thermal gases. The paper explores whether Feshbach molecules should be considered distinct molecular entities or merely as atom pairs near the continuum. This distinction is critical for understanding the BEC to BCS crossover in degenerate Fermi gases. The paper employs a two-channel model to describe interacting atoms near a Feshbach resonance, incorporating a spherical box potential to calculate molecular bound states. This model aids in characterizing the Feshbach resonances observed in recent Fermi gas experiments."

        "article": "the study of supernovae ( sne ) has greatly advanced in the last few years . \n intensive and highly automated monitoring of nearby galaxies ( e.g. , li et al . \n 1996 ; treffers et al . \n 1997 ; filippenko et al . \n 2001 ; dimai 2001 ; qiu & hu 2001 ) , wide - field , moderately deep surveys ( e.g. , reiss et al . 1998 ; gal - yam & maoz 1999 , 2002 ; hardin et al . 2000 ; schaefer 2000 ) , and cosmology - oriented , deep , high - redshift sn search projects ( perlmutter et al . 1997 ; schmidt et al . \n 1998 ) now combine to yield hundreds of new sn discoveries each year . \n ambitious programs that are currently planned or underway [ e.g. , the nearby supernova factory  aldering et al . \n 2001 ; the supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) \n perlmutter et al . 2000 ; automated sn detections in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data  vanden berk et al . \n 2001 ; miknaitis et al . \n 2001b ; see also @xmath9 promise to increase these numbers by at least an order of magnitude . \n sne are heterogeneous events , empirically classified into many subtypes , with the main classification criteria based on spectral properties . \n briefly , sne of type ii show hydrogen lines in their spectra while sne of type i do not . \n each of these types is further divided into subtypes , the commonly used ones including ia , ib , and ic , as well as ii - p , ii - l , iin , and iib . \n see filippenko ( 1997 ) for a thorough review and @xmath10 for more details . \n it is widely accepted that sne  ia are produced from the thermonuclear disruption of a white dwarf at or near the chandrasekhar limit , while all other types of sne ( ib , ic , and ii ) result from the core collapse of massive stars .    while understanding sne , their properties , and their underlying physics is of great interest , sne are also useful tools in the study of various other important problems . \n sne  ia are excellent distance indicators , and their hubble diagram has been used to determine the local value of the hubble constant ( e.g. , parodi et al . \n 2000 , and references therein ) . \n the extension of the hubble diagram to higher redshifts ( @xmath11 ) probes the geometry and matter - energy content of the universe ( e.g. , goobar & perlmutter 1995 ) . \n two independent groups using large samples of high-@xmath12 sne  ia presented a strong case for a current acceleration of the universe ( riess et al . \n 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 \n ; see filippenko 2001 for a summary ) , consistent with a nonzero cosmological constant , @xmath13 . \n subsequent work ( riess et al . 2001 ) based on a single sn  ia at @xmath14 possibly shows the transition from matter - dominated deceleration to @xmath13-dominated acceleration at @xmath15 . \n sne  ii - p can also be used as primary distance estimators through the expanding photosphere method ( epm ; kirshner & kwan 1974 ; schmidt , kirshner , & eastman 1992 ; schmidt et al . \n 1994 ) , as was most recently demonstrated by hamuy et al . \n ( 2001 ) and leonard et al . \n ( 2002a , b ) . \n leonard et al . ( 2002a ; see also hflich et al . 2001 ) suggest that distances good to @xmath16% ( @xmath17 ) may be possible for sne  ii - p by simply measuring the mean plateau visual magnitude , obviating the need for a complete epm analysis unless a more accurate distance is desired . \n hamuy & pinto ( 2002 ) refine this technique , showing that a measurement of the plateau magnitude and the ejecta expansion velocity potentially yields a considerably smaller uncertainty in the derived distance . \n sn rates as a function of redshift probe the star - formation history of the universe , the physical mechanisms leading to sne  ia , and the cosmological parameters ( jorgensen et al . \n 1997 ; sadat et al . 1998 ; ruiz - lapuente & canal 1998 ; madau , della valle , & panagia 1998 ; yungelson & livio 2000 ) . \n sn rates are also important for understanding the chemical enrichment and energetics of the interstellar medium ( e.g. , matteucci & greggio 1986 ) and the intracluster medium ( e.g. , brighenti & mathews 1998 , 2001 ; lowenstein 2000 ; gal - yam , maoz , & sharon 2002 ) . \n once discovered , the study of a particular sn , and its use as a tool for any of the applications above , is almost always based on spectroscopic verification and classification . \n the information extracted from sn spectra usually includes ( but is not limited to ) the sn type , redshift , and age ( relative to the dates of explosion or peak brightness ) . \n spectroscopic followup may not always be possible or practical . \n sne , especially at high redshift , may be too faint for spectroscopy , even with the largest , 10-m - class telescopes currently available . \n spectroscopy is also not practical if large numbers ( hundreds or thousands ) of sne are detected within a relatively short time , as is expected to happen in the case of the sdss southern strip ( miknaitis et al . \n 2001b ; see also @xmath18 ) . \n finally , spectroscopy is impossible for sne discovered in archival data ( gal - yam & maoz 2000 ; riess et al . 2001 ; gal - yam et al . \n 2002 ) , which have long faded by the time they are found . \n the discovery of sne in archival data is expected to become frequent as high - quality astronomical databases become larger and more accessible , especially with the development of projects such as astrovirtel ( http://www.stecf.org/astrovirtel ) and the national virtual observatory ( brunner , djorgovski , & szalay 2001 ) . \n the goal of the present work is to facilitate the scientific exploitation of sne for which no spectroscopic observations exist . \n the obvious alternative for spectroscopy is multi - color broadband photometry . \n the potential utility of such an approach is demonstrated , in principle , by the use of the `` photometric redshift '' method to infer the redshift and type of galaxies and quasars that are too faint or too numerous to observe spectroscopically ( e.g. , weymann et al . \n 1999 ; richards et al . 2001 ) . applying a similar method \n to sne is not straightforward since , unlike galaxies , the spectra of sne vary strongly with type , redshift , and time . while photometric approaches to the study of faint sne have been discussed before ( dahln & fransson 1999 ; sullivan et al . \n 2000 ; riess et al . 2001 ) , no general treatment has been presented thus far .    in a recent paper , dahln & goobar ( 2002 , hereafter dg2002 ) \n tackle the issue of sn classification for the case of deep , cosmology - oriented , high-@xmath12 sn searches . \n their treatment relies heavily on the particular observational setup used by these programs  i.e. , the comparison of images obtained @xmath194 weeks apart , designed to detect sne before , or at , peak brightness . as these authors show , this setup is strongly biased toward the discovery of sne  ia . \n the main theme of dg2002 is the selection of the high-@xmath12 sne  ia from an observed sample , using photometry of the host galaxies and the sne themselves . for the particular observational setup \n they consider , dg2002 also wish to minimize the contamination of the sample by non - ia sne . to do this \n , they use the models of dahln & fransson ( 1999 ) and demonstrate their ability to reject most non - ia sne based on their colors and lower brightness . however , the models used for the population of non - ia sne are based on many parameters and assumptions , such as the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra , peak brightness , light curves , and relative fractions of non - ia sne , that are not precisely known even in the local universe , let alone at high redshift . \n while dg2002 seek only to identify high-@xmath12 sne  ia detected by a particular observational setup , we present general methods that apply to all the major sn subtypes and can be used for a wide range of sn surveys , including searches that are similar to those described by dg2002 . \n classification of sne using broadband colors is such a complex problem that , as we show below , a full solution ( i.e. , deriving sn type , redshift , and age from a few broadband colors ) is probably impossible . \n however we will argue here that the problem may be simplified . \n type , redshift , and age need not all be determined simultaneously . \n most sne are associated with host galaxies that are readily detectable . \n one can therefore infer the redshift of the sn from that of the host , derived either from spectroscopy ( that may be obtained long after the sn has faded ) or using a photometric redshift . \n in fact , for sne that are detected in well - studied parts of the sky , the redshift information often already exists . \n gal - yam et al . \n ( 2002 ) recently demonstrated this with sne they discovered in archival _ \n hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ images of well - studied galaxy - cluster fields . \n five of the six apparent sne they found ( and all of those clearly associated with a host ) had redshift information in the literature . \n for the majority of sne , the redshift can thus be obtained from observations of the host , and treated as a known parameter .    in the absence of a spectrum , the sn age \n may sometimes be revealed by measuring the photometric light curve of the event . \n admittedly , such followup may still pose a problem for faint or very numerous events , and is generally not possible for archival sne ( see riess et al . \n 2001 for an exception ) . \n however , for many of the scientific uses of sne ( e.g. , the derivation of sn rates ) , the age of each event is immaterial . \n determination of the type of a sn is crucial for most of the applications discussed above . \n the sn type can be securely determined only from observations of the active sn itself . \n while some information can be gleaned from the host ( e.g. , elliptical galaxies are known to contain only sne  ia ) , this information is limited and such reasoning may not hold at high redshifts . \n we therefore concentrate our efforts on using multi - color broadband photometry to classify sne . \n since we want to constrain the type of a sn with an arbitrary ( but known ) redshift , it is not simple to utilize broadband photometry ; k - corrections for sne of all types , and at all ages , are currently unknown . instead , we have compiled a large spectral database of nearby , well - observed sne . \n these spectra are used to calculate synthetic broadband colors for various sn types through a given filter set at a given redshift . \n the temporal coverage of our compilation allows us to draw paths in color space which show the time evolution of each sn type . inspecting the resulting diagrams \n , one can then look for regions which are either populated by a single type of sn , or that are avoided by various sn types . \n the observed photometric colors of a candidate sn with a known redshift can then be plotted on the relevant diagrams , and constraints on its type and age may be drawn . \n as we show in @xmath20 , the type of a sn can sometimes be uniquely determined . \n when this is not the case , the type may still be deduced by supplementing the color information with other available data on the sn , such as constraints on its brightness , and information ( even if very limited ) on its variability ( e.g. , whether its flux is rising or declining ) . \n our sn classification method is based on colors , determined by the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each event . by definition \n , such a method can differentiate only between sn subtypes with unique spectral characteristics . \n hypothetically , two sne with very different photometric properties ( e.g. , light curves , peak magnitudes ) , but having similar seds at all ages , would not be distinguished by our method . \n the sn classification scheme we adopt needs , therefore , to rely only on spectral properties . \n fortunately , the common classification of sne ( see filippenko 1997 for a review ) is mostly based on their spectra , with one notable exception which we discuss below . \n it is customary to divide the sn population into two main subgroups : type ii sne , which show prominent hydrogen lines in their spectra , and type i sne , which do not ( minkowski 1941 ) . \n type i sne are further divided into type ia whose spectra are characterized by a deep absorption trough around @xmath21   , attributed to blueshifted si  ii @xmath226347 , 6371 lines , type ib that show prominent he  i lines , and type ic that lack both si  ii and he  i ( e.g. , matheson et al . \n 2001 , and references therein ) . \n type ii sne are divided ( e.g. , barbon , ciatti , & rosino 1979 ; doggett & branch 1985 ) into two subclasses according to their light - curve shape : sne  ii - p show a pronounced plateau during the first @xmath23  d of their evolution , and sne  ii - l decline in a linear fashion in a magnitude vs. time plot , similar to sne  i. further studies ( e.g. , filippenko 1997 ) show that sne  ii - p have characteristic spectra , with the h@xmath24 line showing a p - cygni profile . on the other hand , sne  ii - l have not been well characterized spectroscopically , and the best spectroscopically studied events ( sne 1979c and 1980k ) are considered to be photometrically peculiar ( `` overluminous '' ; miller & branch 1990 ) relative to other sne ii - l . during the 1990s , \n the focus in studies of sne  ii shifted from photometry to spectroscopy . \n two new subtypes have emerged . \n sne  iin show narrow h@xmath24 emission ( e.g. , schlegel 1990 ; filippenko 1997 , and references therein ) , and sne  iib are transition objects that first appear as relatively normal sne  ii , but evolve to resemble sne  ib ( filippenko 1988 ; filippenko , matheson , & ho 1993 ; matheson et al . \n 2001 , and references therein ) . for our study , \n only sn subtypes with well - defined spectral properties are meaningful . \n we therefore consider henceforth only sne ii - p , iin , and iib as subtypes of the sn  ii population . \n sne  iin and iib are probably a large fraction of the sn population that was previously classified as type ii - l based only on their light - curve shape ( approximately half of the sn  ii population , e.g. , cappellaro et al . \n reviewing the latest spectral databases available to us , we estimate that most of the sne  ii discovered by current surveys belong to the spectroscopically defined subtypes ii - p , iin , and iib ( see below ) . \n sne are a veritable zoo , with many peculiar and even unique events , from luminous hypernovae ( e.g. , sn 1998bw  galama et al . \n 1998 ; patat et al . 2001 ; sn 1997cy  germany et al . \n 2000 ; turatto et al . 2000 ; sn 1997ef  iwamoto et al . \n 2000 ; matheson et al . 2001 ) to faint sn 1987a - like events ( e.g. , arnett et al . 1989 , and references therein ) , and sn `` impostors '' ( e.g. , filippenko et al . 1995a ; van dyk et al . 2000 , and references therein ) . \n currently , we limit our discussion to sn types that are not extremely rare , and are well - defined and well - characterized spectroscopically . assuming that the sne reported in the iau circulars are representative of the sn population that is discovered by current programs \n , we estimate that , collectively , the well - defined subtypes we consider ( ia , ib , ic , ii - p , iin , and iib ) constitute at least 83% , and probably more , of the entire population . \n for instance , we consider all the sne that were discovered during the year 2000 and whose type was either reported in iau circulars , or alternatively could be constrained by data available to us . among 110 such events , \n there were 54 type ia , 5 type ib , 5 type ic , 8 type iin , one type iib , two peculiar sne  ia , one peculiar sn  ib , and 34 events which were reported just as `` type ii . '' \n using available spectra or data reported in the iau circulars , we learn that of the latter 34 events , 18 show a p - cygni profile in h@xmath24 , typical of sne  ii - p , 13 events may or may not belong to the ii - p , iin , or iib subtypes , and 3 events are definitely not ii - p , iin , or iib events . \n hence 91 events ( 83% ) belong to our spectroscopically defined sn sample ( types ia , ib , ic , ii - p , iin , and iib ) , 13 events ( 12% ) may or may not be of these types , and just 6 events ( 5% ) are known to be of types not included in our database . \n it is therefore likely that analysis based on our database will be relevant to the large majority of sne discovered by current programs . \n this is probably also true for future programs that will use similar search methods . \n we are aware that a large population of intrinsically faint sne ( e.g. , sn 1987a - like ) may be underrepresented in current sn statistics . \n analysis of future surveys that will be sensitive to such events may require their inclusion in the spectral database . \n the core of our classification algorithm is the spectral database : a compilation of optical spectra of nearby sne . \n most of the these spectra were obtained with the shane 3-m reflector at lick observatory . \n the typical resolution is better than @xmath25    ( full width at half maximum ) , and the majority of the data used cover the range 320010000   . some spectra with narrower coverage ( approximately 40008000   ) are also used . \n all spectra were either obtained at the parallactic angle ( filippenko 1982 ) , or calibrated by simultaneous photometry , to ensure that spectral shape distortions due to wavelength - dependent atmospheric refraction are not significant . \n telluric lines were removed , generally through division by the spectrum of a featureless star . according to the galactic coordinates of the observed sn \n , the spectra were corrected for galactic reddening , using the maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) and the extinction curve of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) . \n the working edition of the database was constructed in the following manner . for each of the well - defined sn subtypes mentioned above , \n we have selected a prototype . \n the main criterion was the availability of spectra with wide wavelength coverage and multiple epochs . \n in addition , a few complementary spectra of other events were included in order to verify consistency and fill gaps in the temporal evolution , when needed . \n table 1 lists the sne whose spectra constitute our database , with the prototypical event for each subtype listed first . \n we have specifically avoided events that were known to either suffer considerable extinction , or to be otherwise peculiar . for sne \n ia , peculiar ( overluminous , sn 1991t - like , or underluminous , sn 1991bg - like ) events are rather well characterized , and may be quite common , at least in low - redshift environments ( li et al . \n our main database includes only spectra of normal sne  ia , but we examine the effects of peculiar sne  ia in @xmath26 below . \n all spectra were de - redshifted according to the host - galaxy redshift taken from the ned database . \n after redshifting the spectra again to a chosen redshift ( see below ) , the telluric features were re - applied before deriving synthetic colors .      using our spectral database , we calculate the synthetic colors of sne at a chosen redshift through the johnson - cousins @xmath4 ( johnson 1965 ; cousins 1976 ; \n see moro & munari 2000 for details ) , bessell @xmath27 ( bessell & brett 1988 ) , and sdss @xmath6 ( fukugita et al . \n 1996 ; stoughton et al . \n 2002 ) filter systems . \n if a filter s bandpass is not fully covered by a sn spectrum , the flux in the missing spectral region is extrapolated linearly using the median value of the spectrum . \n each calculated magnitude that includes such an extrapolation is assigned an error equal to the amount of flux in the extrapolated part of the spectrum , thus providing a conservative error estimate . \n the resulting synthetic photometry is then displayed on color - color diagrams . \n note that in all the plots we present , the ordinate and abscissa are composed of colors consisting of adjacent bands ( e.g. , @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 , @xmath29 vs. @xmath1 etc . ) . \n since most of the spectra in our database have a wide wavelength range , error bars will hence generally appear only on one axis .    in the following section we present such diagrams , discuss their use in the classification of sne discovered by various programs , and derive a few general rules . \n note that the choice of colors that gives the best sn type differentiation , apart from the obvious dependence on the filter system used , also depends on redshift . for optimal results , for each sn ( having a known redshift and some observed colors ) \n one needs to search for color - color diagrams that give the maximum information content . \n obvious space limitations allow us to present below just a few representative examples of such plots . \n similar plots for arbitrary values of @xmath12 may be obtained from our website ( http://wise-obs.tau.ac.il/$\\sim$dovip/typing ) . \n in figure 1 , we compare our data on sne  ia to template colors of normal sne  ia compiled by leibundgut ( 1988 ) . \n one can see that our calculated colors follow the expected path in color space , with a small scatter ( @xmath30 mag ) , consistent with the previously measured dispersion in sne  ia colors ( e.g. , tripp 1998 ; phillips et al . 1999 , and references therein ) . \n since our spectral database includes spectra of sn 1994d , which was somewhat bluer at early times than average sne  ia ( richmond et al . \n 1995 ) , our treatment covers an even wider variety in the colors of early sne  ia . from this plot \n , we can estimate the expected width of color - color paths for normal sne  ia to be @xmath300.3 mag . \n note that sne  ia follow a complex curve in color space , with a distinct turn - around point @xmath16  d after peak brightness . \n the underlying spectral evolution is nontrivial . \n like most sne , the continuum slope of early sne  ia is very blue , and becomes redder as the sn grows older . \n this process is dominant during the first weeks of sn  ia evolution , but is later countered by the emergence of strong emission lines in the blue part of the spectrum ( restframe 40005500   ) . \n the line - dominated spectrum results in unique colors for late - time ( @xmath31  d ) sne  ia ( e.g. , figure 3 , below ) .    in figure 2 our results for sne  ii \n - p are plotted against the observed photometry of the recent , well - observed sn 1999em . \n it can be clearly seen that the results agree perfectly up to around 70  d past maximum brightness , where a bifurcation appears in our calculated color path . \n our spectral data for sne  ii - p is based on three different events ( sne 1992h , 1999em , and 2001x ) . \n the three points that have considerably lower @xmath28 values ( at 110 , 127 , and 165  d ) have all been calculated from the spectra of sn 2001x , which up to that age was consistent with the other sne  ii - p used . \n this demonstrates the well - known variety of late - type spectra of sne  ii ( filippenko 1997 ) . in subsequent plots , \n we retain both branches of `` old '' sne  ii - p ( with the one derived from spectra of sn 2001x marked , when significantly different , in a darker shade ) , and treat the color space bounded by them as a possible location for such sne . \n contrary to sne  ia , the color path of sne  ii - p is quite smooth . \n the underlying spectral evolution is driven mostly by the change in the continuum slope , from very blue at early ages , growing redder with time ( e.g. , filippenko 1997 ) . \n late - time ( @xmath31  d ) spectra become increasingly dominated by strong and broad emission lines , especially h@xmath24 , that give sne  ii - p their distinct late - time colors ( see , e.g. , fig . \n 3 , below ) .      in figure 3 ( top panel ) \n , we show the color paths of all types of sne at zero redshift in @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 . \n one sees that many sne before maximum light are blue , with @xmath32 mag . while most young sne  ii have @xmath33 mag , young sne  ia have bluer @xmath29 colors ( @xmath34 mag ) but redder @xmath28 colors , around @xmath35 mag . \n it is also evident that old ( @xmath36  d ) sne  ia have unique colors ( @xmath37 mag , @xmath38 mag ) , as do some of the sne  ii - p ( ages 19100  d ) which have the reddest colors of all sne . the arrow shows the reddening effect corresponding to @xmath39 mag of extinction , assuming the galactic reddening curve of cardelli et al . \n one can see that the unique colors of young ( @xmath40  d ) and very old ( @xmath31  d ) sne  ia can not be masked even by significant reddening in their host . \n furthermore , we note that high extinction values are rare for sne  ia . for example , only 3 among 49 sne  ia ( @xmath41 ) studied by the cfa and caln / tololo programs , and presented in riess et al . \n ( 1999 ) , have @xmath42 mag . \n conversely , because reddening works only in one direction , some candidates with appropriate observed colors can be uniquely determined to be sne  ia \n .    however , the center of the diagram is populated by sne of all types . for example , a zero - redshift sn , of unknown type , with colors of @xmath43 mag , @xmath44 mag , would be impossible to classify based on these colors only . \n but the middle panel of figure 3 shows that if one examines an additional color , such as @xmath1 , this degeneracy can be partly lifted . \n for the same @xmath45  mag , there is a spread in @xmath1 that can shed some light on the sn type . \n a value of @xmath46 mag would favor a type ia classification , while a positive value would suggest one of the core - collapse types . \n addition of an @xmath2 measurement ( fig . \n 3 , bottom panel ) would narrow the options even further , since in this color , at this redshift , different types have distinct values , from the bluest sne  ia to the reddest types ( ib , ic , and ii - p ) . looking at the reddening vectors in the middle and bottom panels of figure 3 , we again note that only heavy extinction ( @xmath47 mag ) can move sne  ia into color regions populated by core - collapse sne .    before we proceed , we briefly comment on the effects of host - galaxy contamination . \n since our approach assumes the redshift of a given sn is a known parameter , and this is commonly available through the observation of the host galaxy , some data on the galaxy should exist . \n it should therefore generally be possible to subtract the galaxy s light from the sn photometry . to study the effect of non - subtraction of host - galaxy light , or imperfect subtraction , we parameterize the amount of the contaminating galactic flux , at a given epoch , by the ratio @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the mean flux of the host galaxy and sn spectra , respectively , calculated over the wavelength range of the spectrum of the sn . \n we consider contamination as negligible , when it is not likely to make one type of sn look like another . \n first , we find that for all types of sne and hosts , when @xmath51 the effect of contamination is indeed negligible . for young sne  ia , the worst - case scenario would be the contamination by a red elliptical host that could make them look like redder core - collapse sne . when observed in restframe blue colors ( e.g. , @xmath52 ) , this effect becomes significant only when @xmath53 , but if red bands ( e.g. , @xmath54 ) are used , contaminated sne  ia attain colors similar to those of the core - collapse population already at @xmath55 . \n the opposite effect ( i.e. , of bluer host galaxies on red core - collapse sne ) is much weaker , so contamination by spiral hosts is unlikely to mix core - collapse sne with young sne  ia . only heavy contamination ( @xmath56 ) by a very blue , star - forming host galaxy can make a red sn  ii - p appear similar to a bluer sn  ia on a @xmath52 color - color diagram . in redder bands ( e.g. , @xmath54 ) , \n even this extreme case causes negligible shifts in color . \n we conclude that if the host galaxy light has been subtracted , at least roughly , from the measured sn photometry , residual contamination has no significant implication . a large contribution from an underlying host \n ( e.g. , with a flux similar to that of the sn itself ) that has not been removed may mask blue sne  ia as core - collapse events , but is unlikely to make red core - collapse events appear as sne  ia . in the discussion below \n , we therefore neglect contamination of the sn photometry by light from the underlying host galaxy .      with increasing redshift , the available spectral information shifts to longer - wavelength filters . \n the top panel of figure 4 demonstrates how well sne  ia can be differentiated from other types at @xmath57 on a @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 diagram . on the @xmath2 axis \n the only sne with negative values are sne  ia . \n they are also the only type with @xmath1 color greater than 0.6 mag while @xmath2 is smaller than 0.3 mag . during most of the temporal evolution of sne  ia , \n their distinction from other types is practically unaffected by host galaxy dust reddening , as can be seen from the vector plotted ( the reddening is calculated in the sn rest frame ) . \n the middle panel of figure 4 shows a similar diagram computed at @xmath58 . \n classification is obviously more difficult . \n still , sne  ii - p ( including `` sn 2001x - like , '' see @xmath59 ) at ages above 100  d have @xmath2 values higher than sne of other types ( at all ages ) . \n close to peak flux , sne  ia have @xmath1 colors of a few tenths of a magnitude bluer than other types , and again , this distinction is not sensitive to reddening . even where all types seem to mingle , at @xmath60 mag and @xmath61 mag , sne  ia and ii - p have @xmath1 values that are 0.2 mag higher than other types . should one of these types be rendered unlikely by other data , such as a sn that is too bright to be a sn  ii - p , the classification can become unique or nearly so . \n for example , sne  ii - p can be unambiguously identified by their light curves ; no other sn type has a roughly constant @xmath54 brightness over such a long period . in principle , two @xmath62-band ( restframe ) observations separated by , say , 30  d can unambiguously identify a sn  ii - p .    at redshifts \n higher than 0.6 , the @xmath62 band samples the restframe uv , not covered by our spectral database . \n thus , only one color ( @xmath2 ) remains in the johnson - cousins system . \n the sdss filter system has 3 filters ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath12 ) in the approximate range covered by the @xmath65 and @xmath66 filters , but extending farther into the red by @xmath67   . using this system \n , we can extend our analysis to higher redshifts . \n this is demonstrated in the bottom panel of figure 4 for sne at @xmath7 . \n again , late - time sne  ii - p are significantly redder than other types ( @xmath68 mag and @xmath69 mag ) , while early - time sne  ia are significantly bluer ( @xmath70 mag and @xmath71 mag ) , and remain so even in the presence of significant reddening by dust . at later times \n ( over two months ) , sne  ia escape from the vicinity of other types and reach @xmath72 values above 1.2 mag . \n sne  iin at this redshift appear to be isolated from other types . \n as we move even farther up the redshift scale the use of infrared ( ir ) filters is required . between @xmath73 and @xmath74 , \n classification would require a combination of optical and ir photometry . \n figure 5 ( top panel ) shows that at @xmath75 , sne  ia have distinct blue colors ( @xmath76 mag and @xmath77 mag ) at almost all ages , sne  ii - p develop very red @xmath78 colors ( @xmath79 mag ) two months after peak , while sne  ib and ic are the only ones that have @xmath80 colors that are redder than @xmath81 mag . \n as before , these distinctions are hardly affected by extinction . between @xmath82 and 2.5 our spectra shift into the region covered by the bessell @xmath27 filters . \n in the bottom panel of figure 5 ( @xmath83 ) , one can see that sne  ia have generally lower @xmath80 colors ( @xmath84 mag ) , except between ages of one to two months , shared perhaps by very early type iin , ii - p , and ic events . \n sne  ib and ic are the only objects to have both @xmath80 and @xmath85 above unity . \n the use of synthetic colors , calculated from spectra of local sne , to classify high-@xmath12 events , assumes that sn spectra do not evolve strongly with redshift . \n the similarity , to a first approximation , between the spectra of distant sne  ia and their local counterparts has been demonstrated ( riess et al . 1998 ; coil et al . 2000 ) . \n however , for all other types of sne , high - quality spectra of distant ( @xmath86 ) events are largely unavailable . \n since we use synthetic broadband colors , only significant evolution in either the spectral slope or strong emission or absorption features will influence our classification method . nevertheless , this is a caveat that must be addressed once spectra of distant core - collapse sne become available . \n we now examine the colors of peculiar sne  ia and their implication for our classification method . following the same approach used earlier , we have compiled spectra of the most extreme varieties of peculiar sne  ia : overluminous ( sn 1991t - like ; e.g. , filippenko et al . \n 1992a ) and underluminous ( sn 1991bg - like ; e.g. , filippenko et al . \n 1992b ) objects , as well as spectra of sn 2000cx , a unique sn  ia that may be considered a subtype of its own ( li et al . \n table 2 provides observational details for these objects .    inspecting figure 6 ( top panel ) , \n which shows the @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 colors of the various sn  ia subtypes at zero redshift , we see that , although the paths of peculiar sne  ia in color space are different from those of `` normal '' sne  ia , they populate the same general region . on the other hand , in the middle panel of figure 6 , showing @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 colors at zero redshift , one can see that underluminous sne  ia have significantly larger @xmath2 values ( by 0.20.6 mag ) than those of all other sne  ia , and are therefore liable to mix with the redder core - collapse population . \n this is illustrated in the bottom panel of the same figure , where indeed , underluminous sne  ia at early ages ( prior to @xmath87  d ) can not be distinguished from core - collapse sne . \n later in their evolution , these events acquire unique colors ( @xmath88 mag , @xmath89 mag ) that are different from all other types of sne .    as sn 1991t - like and sn 2000cx - like events are almost always bluer than `` normal '' sne  ia , they are generally easier to distinguish from core - collapse sne , and pose no special problem in our analysis . \n sne  ia of the underluminous , redder , sn 1991bg - like variety are hard to distinguish from core - collapse sne at early ages , and may be lost in color - based classification . \n this problem is quite limited at low redshift , where underluminous sne  ia are rare ( @xmath90% of the sn  ia population ; li et al . \n 2001a ) , and may be totally negligible at higher redshifts where , empirically , sn 1991bg - like events have not been found at all ( li et al . \n 2001a ) . \n high - redshift sn search programs that focus on finding sne  ia for use as distance indicators encounter the problem of sample contamination by other sn types , especially a luminous variety of sne  ic ( riess et al . \n 1998 ; clocchiatti et al . 2000 ) . \n the problem is two - fold . \n first , unwanted non - ia sne take up precious telescope resources for followup spectroscopy . \n second , when only low signal - to - noise ratio spectra of faint , high-@xmath12 events are available , luminous sne  ic may masquerade as sne  ia . \n the latter problem is acute at high @xmath12 , since at these redshifts the sn  ia hallmark ( the si  ii @xmath91 trough ) is shifted out of the optical range , and sne  ic spectra lack the telltale h or he lines that distinguish sne  ii and sne  ib , respectively . \n spectra with high signal - to - noise ratios can provide definitive classifications ( coil et al . \n 2000 ) , but these are time - consuming to obtain . \n > from figure 7 , one sees that color information may help , at least partially , to alleviate this problem . \n we confirm and quantify the well known `` rule of thumb '' ( e.g. , riess et al . \n 2001 ) : sne  ic are red compared to sne  ia at a similar redshift . \n one can see that , for sne at ages that are relevant for high-@xmath12 search programs , designed to discover sne near peak brightness , sne  ia are typically 0.5 mag bluer in @xmath72 than sne  ic , well above the typical effects of reddening . while it is true that rising ( pre - maximum ) sne  ic have colors similar to those of older ( @xmath92 weeks past maximum ) sne  ia , even the most basic variability information ( e.g. , whether the object is rising or declining ) breaks this degeneracy . \n figure 7 also illustrates the fact that most of the information at this redshift can be obtained from the @xmath72 color alone , and the inclusion of @xmath12-band information does not appear to be cost - effective . \n sn 2001fg was the third sn reported from sdss data . \n this event was discovered on 15 october 2001 ut by vanden berk et al . \n ( 2001 ) with @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 mag . inspecting the color - color diagram calculated for the appropriate redshift ( @xmath96 , see below ) , one can see ( fig . \n 8) that the type and approximate age of the sn candidate can be deduced . \n the diagram clearly indicates this is a sn  ia , around one month old . \n followup spectra by filippenko & chornock ( 2001 ) using the keck ii 10-m telescope reveal that the object is indeed a sn  ia , at @xmath96 . \n the spectrum is similar to those of sne  ia about two months past maximum brightness . \n this age , at the time of the spectral observation ( 18 november ut ) , implies an age around one month past maximum brightness at discovery , confirming our diagnosis . \n a fully `` blind '' application would have , of course , required an independent photometric or spectroscopic redshift for the sn host galaxy . \n the method presented here can become significantly more powerful when more observational data become available . \n faint , high-@xmath12 sne are usually observed at optical wavelengths ( i.e. , @xmath62 , @xmath65 , or @xmath66 bands ) . in order to use these bands for classification , knowledge of the restframe uv spectrum \n is required . \n currently , uv spectra are available for only a handful of objects , while methods like those discussed here require multi - epoch coverage of several objects for each sn subtype . \n further characteristics of the various sn types , most notably the absolute peak magnitudes and their scatter for every sn type , the typical light curves , and the relative rates of the different types , would also be useful . with such data in hand , one could use the limiting magnitude of a survey to calculate , for each sn type , at what epochs it is bright enough to be observed , thus removing some degeneracy in the classification . \n a further enhancement could be introduced to deal with the regions in color space that are populated by several different sn types . using the typical light curves and known peak magnitudes for all types , and the relative rates \n , one could calculate the amount of time a sn of a certain type spends within a region and deduce the likelihood that an observed event belongs to a particular type . \n as already mentioned in @xmath97 , work along these lines has been presented by dg2002 , who replace missing observational data with rough estimates or models . \n sne are generally discovered by their variability . \n however , the tools developed in this paper may enable one to detect sne by their colors alone . \n indeed , such methods have recently been discussed for the detection of another kind of transient phenomenon  gamma - ray burst afterglows ( rhoads 2001 ) . \n multi - color wide - field surveys ( e.g. , becker et al . \n 2001 ; jannuzi et al . 2001 ; sdss  york et al . \n 2000 ) that are either planned or already underway may be used to discover large numbers of sne using similar methods . to illustrate this point , we plot in figure 9 the locations of sne of all types at @xmath98 , together with a polygon within which fall the vast majority of stars , asteroids , cataclysmic variables , cepheids , and quasars , as discussed by krisciunas , margon , & szkody ( 1998 ) . \n except for late - time sne  ic , all sne have lower @xmath99 values and higher @xmath72 values than these objects . \n similar results are obtained for the sn population at @xmath100 00.3 , the redshifts of sne probed by the sdss . \n this demonstrates the feasibility of color selection of sne , a method which may emerge as an invaluable resource when applied to upcoming , large data sets . \n an exciting application of the methods presented in this paper would be the study of sne discovered in the sdss southern strip . during the months of september to november , when the primary target of the sdss , the north galactic pole , is not visible , the sdss telescope observes parts of the sky near the south galactic pole . \n the so called `` south equatorial strip '' is a patch of sky that will be imaged repeatedly during the 5-year planned operations of the survey . according to the sdss website ( http://www.sdss.org/documents/5yearbaseline.pdf ) , this 270 square degree area will be imaged @xmath101 times during the 5-year period , or about 4 times each fall , on average . assuming that this sampling enables the discovery of all sne that occur during the @xmath19 months this strip is imaged each year , for five years , the total surveyed area is @xmath102 deg@xmath103-months , or 337.5 deg@xmath103-years . \n pain et al . \n ( 1996 ) have measured a sn  ia rate of 34 per year per square degree in the magnitude range @xmath104 , and the limiting magnitude of the sdss images in this band is given as @xmath105 mag . \n we would then expect some 2300 sne  ia each year or a total of over 11,000 sne  ia in this strip . \n the numbers of sne of all types ( not just ia ) will undoubtedly be even larger . \n miknaitis et al . \n ( 2001b ) report that a systematic search for sne in these data is underway , and the first sne have already been reported ( miknaitis et al . 2001a ; rest , miceli , & covarrubias 2001 ; miknaitis & krisciunas 2001 ) . \n this huge expected dataset , which may contain an order of magnitude more events than all previously known sne , all with five - band photometry and possibly some variability information , offers an unprecedented resource for sn studies . as an example , sn rates , based on thousands of events , can be computed as a function of sn type , host - galaxy morphology , and redshift . \n however , it is clear that obtaining spectra for thousands of faint sne each fall is not feasible . \n photometric classification could therefore be a valuable option . the sdss supplies five - band information , along with ready - made tools for the derivation of photometric redshifts for all host galaxies , and spectral identification for part of the brighter ones . \n this makes our approach of using the sn photometry for classification , assuming that the redshift is known , even more appropriate . \n since no followup is required , such an analysis need not be done in real time  in principle , it may even be carried out long after the project is complete , and all the data are publicly available .    in summary , we have presented a method for the classification of sne , using multi - color broadband photometry . \n we have shown that the type of a sn may be uniquely determined in some cases . even when this is not the case , constraints on the type may still be drawn . \n in particular , sne  ia may be distinguished from core - collapse sne during long periods in their evolution , for most of the redshifts and filter combinations studied . \n finally , we have demonstrated the application of our method to a recently discovered sn from the sdss , and we have shown how this technique may become a valuable tool for the analysis of the large sn samples expected to emerge from this and other programs that are already active or will begin soon . \n this work proves that spectroscopic followup is not always a prerequisite for sne to be a valuable scientific resource , and lays the foundations for the exploitation of large sn samples for which such followup may not be possible . \n we thank the many people in a.v.f.s group at the university of california , berkeley ( especially a. j. barth , r. chornock , l. c. ho , and j. c. shields ) who , over the years , helped obtain and calibrate the spectra that constitute much of the dataset used in this study . \n we are grateful to a. fassia , m. hamuy , and y. qiu for supplying us with digital copies of their spectra of sn 1998s , 1999ee , and 1996cb , respectively . \n b. leibundgut generously provided help with sn light curves , and we thank d. branch , e. o. ofek , g. richards , and o. shemmer for useful suggestions . \n we acknowledge the assistance of the staffs of various observatories ( especially lick ) where the data were taken . this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration . \n d. m. acknowledges support by the israel science foundation  the jack adler foundation for space research , grant 63/01 -

        "abstract": "The study of supernovae (SNe) has advanced significantly due to intensive monitoring and automated detection systems. Research has categorized SNe based on their spectral properties into several subtypes, with Type II SNe displaying hydrogen lines and Type I lacking them. SNe play a crucial role in various cosmological studies, serving as distance indicators and providing insights into the universe's expansion. This paper details the increasing capabilities in SN discovery, classification, and the implications for cosmology, highlighting the efficiency of using multi-color broadband photometry for SN classification in the absence of spectroscopy."

[ czz ]    these results can also be obtained from the quantum relativistic theory of the spin-@xmath0 charged particle@xcite . \n let us introduce the dirac hamiltonian h = e+ c(p - ea ) + _ 0 mc^2 [ ham1 ] having made use of the dirac s matrices = ( ) ,   _ 0 = ( ) ,   = _ 0 = ( ) , [ mat - d ] where @xmath22 is a vector whose components are the pauli s matrices _ x = ( ) ,   _ y = ( ) ,   _ z = ( ) ,   [ mat - p ] @xmath23 is the @xmath24 identity matrix , @xmath25 the null matrix and having chosen the @xmath26-axis parallel to the main magnetic field . a standard \n derivation leads to the non relativistic expression of the hamiltonian exhibiting the sg interaction with the `` normal '' magnetic moment = e+ ( p - ea)^2 - ( b ) [ hamp ] which coincides with the pauli equation and is valid in the prf .    to complete the derivation \n we must add the contribution from the anomalous magnetic moment to the sg energy term in the previous equation , with a factor @xmath27 , yielding - b = - ^ * b    ^ * = g . \n [ sgenergy ]    in order to obtain the @xmath28-component of the sg force in the laboratory frame along the direction of motion of the particle , we must boost the whole pauli term of eq.([hamp ] ) by using the unitary operator @xmath29 in the hilbert space@xcite , which expresses the lorentz transformation u^-1 u = g(_0b ) [ hilb ] that can be written in terms of the equivalent transformation in the @xmath30 spinor space s = = + ( ) [ str ] with = ,   u = = = ,   u =   (= ) . \n [ defs ]    from eqs.([hilb ] ) and ( [ str ] ) , due to the algebraic structure of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 matrices , we obtain in the laboratory frame the three components of the sg force \\ {    lll s^-1 ( _ 0 _ x ) s & = & _ 0 _ x + s^-1 ( _ 0 _ y ) s & = & _ 0 _ y + s^-1 ( _ 0 _ z ) s & = & ( _ 0 _ z ) + i_0_5    . , \n [ evxyz ] with _ 5 = _ x_y_z_0 = i ( ) . \n [ g5 ]    from eqs.([evxyz ] ) we can deduce the expectation values of the sg force in the laboratory system with a defined spin -along the @xmath26-axis in our case- via the expectation values of the pauli matrices and of the pauli interaction term of the proper force f_z = _ 0_y^2^*. [ fz4 ] in our case only the second of eqs.([evxyz ] ) gives a non vanishing result , while both the first and third produce a null contribution to the force , because of the orthogonality of the two spin states @xmath33 and the properties of the @xmath32 matrices . \n let us consider the standing waves built up inside a rectangular radio - frequency resonator , tuned to a generic te mode@xcite . \n resonator dimensions are : width @xmath13 , height @xmath34 and length @xmath35 , as shown in fig.[fig : box ] . on the cavity axis , which coincides with the beam axis , the electric and magnetic fields are@xcite @xmath36   \\\\ \\\\ \n b_x & = & - { b_0\\over k_c^2 } \\left({m\\pi\\over a}\\right )   \\left({p\\pi\\over d}\\right )   \\sin\\left({m\\pi x\\over a}\\right )   \\cos\\left({n\\pi y\\over b}\\right )    \\cos\\left({p\\pi z\\over d}\\right ) \\cos\\,\\omega t   \\\\ \\\\ b_y & = & - { b_0\\over k_c^2 } \\left({n\\pi\\over b}\\right )   \\left({p\\pi\\over d}\\right )   \\cos\\left({m\\pi x\\over a}\\right )   \\sin\\left({n\\pi y\\over b}\\right )    \\cos\\left({p\\pi z\\over d}\\right ) \\cos\\,\\omega t   \\\\ \\\\ b_z & = & b_0 \n \\cos\\left({m\\pi x\\over a}\\right )   \\cos\\left({n\\pi y\\over b}\\right )    \\sin\\left({p\\pi z\\over d}\\right ) \\cos\\,\\omega t \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the rf peak magnetic field , @xmath11 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are integer mode indeces , and k_c = . \n [ kc ]    the angular frequency of the e.m . \n wave from the rf generator is = _ \n = 2c _ = c. [ omegen ]    in contrast with an open waveguide , in a bounded cavity we can define a phase velocity @xmath40 and a cavity wavelength @xmath41 , as typical of any e.m . in a refractive media , according to the relations = _ = dp . \n [ rphv ] and _ = _ ph_. [ cav - wl ]    it is also = _ c = _ =    notice that @xmath42 can take any value , even larger than one , since it is freely dependent on the cavity geometrical parameters . \n moreover , combining eqs.([omegen ] ) and ( [ rphv ] ) we obtain d = p _ _ = p _ [ cav - length ]    which describes the connection between the cavity length @xmath35 and the wavelengths , as shown in fig.[fig : edge ] .    for simplicity , let s choose the transverse electric mode @xmath43 , so eqs.([omegen ] ) and ( [ rphv ] ) reduce respectively to = _ \n = c = _ c    _ = [ ombetap ] or , setting the mode index @xmath44 , = _ \n = c = _ c    _ = , [ ombeta1 ] which are the quantities pertaining to the preferred @xmath45 mode whose non zero field components on the cavity axis are \\ {    l b_y(z , t ) = - b_0 ( ) t +   + e_x(z , t ) = -b_0 ( ) t    .. [ byex ]    it is important to emphasize that in all the field components met so far there is a clear separation between spatial and temporal contributions , as typical of standing waves . \n besides , the boundary conditions of the electric and magnetic fields of the e.m . dictate the shape of the spatial component which , in turn , oscillates in time with the frequency @xmath46 . then , at the cavity entrance and exit the field components  ( [ byex ] ) become on axis \\ { \n l b_y(0,t ) = -b_0 t +   + e_x(0,t ) = 0    ..

[ edge - out ] where @xmath47 is a generic time . \n the null values of @xmath48 at the cavity ends confirm a typical pattern of the transverse electric mode . \n from eq.([fz4 ] ) , after some algebra , we obtain tha a charged fermion which crosses a radio - frequency resonator , tuned on the te@xmath49 mode , acquires ( or loses ) an energy amount when interacts with the field component in the `` body '' of the cavity shown in fig .

[ edge - flds ]    under these conditions , a relativistic fermion with its spin directed along the @xmath26-axis and traversing the cavity will experience a sg force parallel to the @xmath28-axis ( direction of motion ) , see eq.([fsgz ] ) f_z = ^ * c_zy [ fz ] where @xmath56 is given by the second of the set of eqs.([czz ] ) . for the moment \n we assume that the spin will conserve its orientation during traversal    the electric field @xmath48 and its derivatives in this equation are almost constantly zero , because of the boundary conditions on the walls of the cavity and at the extreme points @xmath57 and @xmath58 . \n furthermore , the function@xmath59 is almost zero along the fringe segments because of its proportionality to @xmath60 , with @xmath47 equal to the @xmath54 mentioned before . \n consequently we have c_zy ^2 , [ redczy ] and for the entire fringe field \\ {    lll _ & = & -b_0^*^2 ( ) +   + _ & = & b_0^*^2 ( )    ..

        "abstract": "This study explores the Stern-Gerlach (SG) interaction of a relativistic fermion with an electromagnetic wave within a radio frequency (RF) resonator. By examining the energy exchange between a spin-polarized particle and the electromagnetic field, the paper elucidates how particles with opposite spins, corresponding to different energies, can be separated. Theoretical frameworks such as the Dirac Hamiltonian and Pauli's equation are employed to model the SG interaction in non-inertial frames, specifically analyzing the spin behavior under Lorentz transformations. The results demonstrate potential applications in particle beam technology, emphasizing spin state manipulation using RF resonators. Practical implementations and numerical simulations are proposed to further validate and utilize the SG interaction for enhanced control over particle beams."

        "article": "excitons in semiconductors have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical investigations of bose condensation . \n low - energy exciton - exciton interactions are characterized by the exciton - exciton scattering length , @xmath5 , which determines the thermodynamics of a low density gas and is crucial for modeling the thermalization time of a dilute exciton gas . despite its importance \n , the exciton - exciton scattering length is an elusive quantity , being difficult to measure experimentally or to estimate theoretically . \n as is well - known in atomic physics , scattering lengths can be extremely sensitive to the details of the interactions between particles . \n in particular , the existence of a weakly bound or nearly bound state causes the scatter length to become quite large . \n therefore , _ a priori _ one should suspect that exciton - exciton scattering may be a very material dependent property of semiconductors . \n reliable theoretical predictions of exciton - exciton scatting lengths require both a very accurate hamiltonian for the semiconductor , and an accurate solution to the ( four - particle ) scattering problem . in this paper \n we provide an essentially exact solution to exciton - exciton scattering for a commonly used single - band effective mass hamiltonian . \n this solution allows us to study three important questions : ( 1 ) how sensitive is the scattering length to the mass ratio @xmath6 , ( 2 ) how does the scattering length depend on spin states ( singlet or triplet ) of the scattering excitons , and ( 3 ) to what degree can inter - exciton exchange of electrons or holes cause excitons to scatter into different spin states ? \n this calculations also serve as a benchmark for the single band limit of more complicated scattering hamiltonians .    one experimental method for measuring the exciton scattering cross section is to look at line width broadening of the recombination spectra in a gas of excitons \n . collisions between excitons increase the line width , causing the line width to depend on the exciton - exciton scattering rate , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the density and @xmath9 is a typical exciton velocity . \n extracting cross sections from a line width requires that ( 1 ) the density and velocity distribution are known , and ( 2 ) elastic scattering is the fastest process . as discussed below , @xmath10 is a good material for comparison to the model studied in this work . \n et al._@xcite have performed such experiments on @xmath10 and have found a line width broadening that suggests an upper bound of @xmath11 on the scattering length . \n although our simulations do not exactly model @xmath10 , we will compare our results to this value . \n theoretical approaches to this problem start with the effective mass approximation , in which the system under consideration consists of two electrons , labeled @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and two holes , labeled @xmath14 and @xmath15 . \n the hamiltonian is @xmath16 where @xmath17 . the hamiltonian has symmetry under exchange of electrons and exchange of holes , so eigenstates may be denoted by two exchange quantum numbers . \n the s - wave states are symmetric under exchange of excitons ; a condition which is satisfied by states @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the @xmath20 signs refer to ( anti)symmetry under exchange of electrons and holes , respectively . \n although this hamiltonian is a well - accepted model for exciton - exciton scattering , we should point out a few of its deficiencies . for small excitons , such as those in @xmath10 , that have radii not much larger than the lattice spacing , non - parabolic terms in the kinetic energy and other corrections to the potential energy may be necessary . for many semiconductors , such as si and ge , \n the valence band is a mixture of three bands and can not be described by a single parabolic band . in the case of @xmath10 , \n the valence band is the parabolic spin - orbit split off band , and there are fewer complications . \n interband exchange ( virtual electron - hole recombination ) is an important effect that has been neglected , and could be modeled by an additional spin - dependent potential term . \n this hamiltonian also describes a family of scattering processes for other particles , including hydrogen - hydrogen , positronium - positronium , and muonium - muonium scattering . \n the equal mass case is at an extreme ( positronium scattering ) , where the born - oppenheimer approximation is the least applicable . \n there have been several theoretical estimates of exciton - exciton scattering for bulk systems@xcite and quantum wells@xcite as well as calculations on biexciton - biexciton scattering,@xcite only the bulk , elastic scattering calculations@xcite are directly comparable to the results of this paper , but the techniques presented here could be generalized to the other scattering problems . \n also , the results presented here provide a benchmark for evaluating the approximations used in other theoretical treatments , and could lend insight into the reliability of the approximations in more complicated situations . \n one standard theoretical approach is diagrammatic perturbation theory , as presented in the work of keldysh and kolsov@xcite and haug and hanamura.@xcite they estimate the exciton - exciton scattering matrix as arising from a single term , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 represents a state of two noninteracting excitons with momentum @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the inter - exciton coulomb interaction . \n this method gives an estimate of @xmath26 ( independent of the mass ratio ) , where @xmath27 is the exciton radius , but it is an uncontrolled approximation which may have limited validity in the low energy limit \n . one serious drawback of the method is that it does not include effects of the biexciton in the scattering . \n as we show later , biexciton vibrational states cause strong dependence of the scattering length on the mass ratio @xmath6 , which is not captured by the low order perturbation theory . \n a second common approach was developed by elkomoss and munchy,@xcite and uses an effective exciton - exciton potential defined by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the wavefunction for two free excitons a distance @xmath30 apart . \n the effective potential @xmath31 arises from the hartree term and is used in a two - particle central - field calculation . \n while an exciton - exciton scattering pseudo - potential would be a very useful tool , this approximate form has some serious drawbacks . among its deficiencies \n are a lack of correlation , no van der waals attraction , a failure to reproduce biexciton states , and a vanishing interaction potential for @xmath32 . \n the cross sections calculated by this method are small and lack qualitative agreement with the results of the present work . \n some insight into exciton - exciton scattering can be gained by considering the bound states , biexcitons . since the number of bound states , @xmath33 , enters in the phase shift at zero energy , @xmath34 , it is necessary that a good computation method for low energy scattering be able accurately calculate biexciton binding energies.@xcite for the mass ratios considered ( and far beyond , including deuterium ) the biexcitons can not bind in the @xmath19 states , so biexcitons in rotational @xmath35 states always have @xmath18 wavefunctions . \n detailed theoretical descriptions of biexcitons can be found in ref . \n the equal mass case was shown to have a bound biexciton by hyllerass and ore using a variational argument,@xcite and a better variational estimate of the binding energy was given by brinkman , rice and bell,@xcite who found @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the exciton binding energy . however , because of the importance of correlation energy , the latter variational treatment was missing _ \n half _ of the biexciton binding energy , as shown by diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations,@xcite which find @xmath38 . \n dmc is a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method that uses a random walk to project out the ground state wavefunction from a variational wavefunction , in order to stochastically sample the exact ground state energy . \n the success of dmc for calculating biexciton energies has been a motivation for its use in the present scattering calculations . \n the @xmath30-matrix approach to scattering is to examine the standing waves of the system . \n as shown by carlson , pandharipande , and wiringa@xcite and alhassid and koonin,@xcite by fixing nodes in the standing waves the scattering problem may be cast as a stationary state problem suitable for qmc methods . for an elastic scattering process \n , we label the distance between the products by @xmath30 , and the reduced mass of the products by @xmath39 . in exciton - exciton scattering \n there is a subtlety in the definition of r due to inter - exciton exchange , which we will address below in our discussion of the exciton - exciton scattering wavefunctions . nonetheless , for large separation @xmath30 \n , the relative motion of the products is free - particle like , so the many - body wavefunction depends on @xmath30 as @xmath40 , \\label{asymptoticform}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the relative angular momentum , @xmath42 is the scattering momentum , and @xmath43 is the phase shift . if we constrain the wavefunction to have a node at a large exciton separation @xmath44 , we find a discrete energy spectrum @xmath45 , which may be computed by ground state or excited state methods , such as dmc . \n each choice of @xmath44 gives a spectrum of states @xmath46 , with energies @xmath47 that determine values of @xmath43 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 . \n the scattering matrix elements are determined by the phase shifts , @xmath50 -

and configuration ii as @xmath90 , @xmath91 . \n we choose wavefunctions @xmath92 and @xmath93 to represent these states , @xmath94 where @xmath95 , and parameters in the function @xmath96 are variational . \n these wavefunctions represent two excitons in a relative s - wave state . \n since these are not eigenstates of the exchange operator for electrons @xmath97 or holes , @xmath98 , we take linear combinations of the two for our trial wavefunctions , @xmath99 and @xmath100 . for large separation of excitons , \n the exponential factors prohibit both configurations from simultaneously contributing to the wavefunction . \n thus , a node can be approximated in the scattering wavefunction by simply requiring that @xmath101 be zero for all @xmath102 . \n the error introduced by this approximation is of order @xmath103 , and is another limit on the use of small values for @xmath44 . \n since we only do calculations for low energy scattering , large @xmath44 , the lack of a well - defined exciton - exciton separation distance for short distances does not matter .     of the dmc states relative to the vmc states as a function of dmc projection time @xmath65 , \n for basis states @xmath104 . \n the eigenvalue equation is given by eqs . \n ( [ eq : eigen])([eq : hmat ] ) , where the hamiltonian and overlap matrices have been sampled using eqs . \n ( [ eq : overlapest ] ) and ( [ eq : hmatest ] ) . ] \n this method for calculating scattering properties is very sensitive to the energy spectra @xmath105 . to get accurate energies , \n we do not try to construct and optimize elaborate variational wavefunctions , but rather use dmc to project the energy from trial wavefunctions of the form given in eq . \n ( [ trial_ex_scat_psi_eq ] ) . \n the coefficients @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 are chosen to obey the cusp conditions on the wavefunction for small particle separations . \n the s - wave envelope functions @xmath101 are taken as solutions to an empirical exciton - exciton scattering potentials , @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 have been self - consistently fit to approximate the energy spectrum of the four particle scattering states . \n we take the guiding function @xmath68 to have the same form as the @xmath82 wavefunctions with @xmath113^{1/2}$ ] . \n the parameters @xmath114 are chosen to bias sampling towards the collision : @xmath115 for @xmath18 states and @xmath116 for @xmath19 states to check for convergence of the energies in dmc , we plot the energy difference , @xmath117 , as a function of projection time in fig . \n [ evstfig ] . \n we see convergence after a projection time of 3 @xmath118 .    , for ( a ) symmetric @xmath18 states , and ( b ) antisymmetric @xmath19 states , with @xmath119 . the lowest energy curve in ( a ) is the biexciton with binding energy @xmath120 . these functions @xmath121 determine the phase shifts @xmath122 and @xmath123 , by the relationship in eq . \n ( [ kfrome ] ) . ] \n we thus find two energy spectra for each value of @xmath44 , as shown in figs . \n [ evsrnfig](a ) and [ evsrnfig](b ) . \n the spectra for the symmetric states @xmath18 , show a clearly bound biexciton state , as seen in fig . \n [ evsrnfig](a ) . \n the antisymmetric states @xmath19 , as shown in fig . \n [ evsrnfig](b ) , have no bound state . \n the binding energy of the biexciton is @xmath124 , in agreement with other ground state calculations , and is insensitive to the position of the node @xmath125 because it is localized . \n in contrast , the delocalized scattering states are quite sensitive to @xmath125 , and their dependence on @xmath125 is a measure of the elastic scattering matrix elements .       for the two @xmath35-wave scattering states , for @xmath119 , calculate using eq . \n ( [ kfrome ] ) and the data from fig . \n [ evsrnfig ] . ] \n .coefficients for polynomomial fit to the low energy part of the phase shift functions for the case @xmath119 .

wave scattering cross sections versus scattering momentum for the case @xmath119 and all non - zero spin configurations . fig . \n [ cs1fig](a ) shows scattering of two singlet - excitons . \n scattering of two triplet - excitons is shown in fig . \n [ cs1fig](b ) , where the solid line represents the spin aligned @xmath141 state , and the dashed line represents the @xmath142 state . \n the @xmath142 state scatters particularly strong because it has a large contribution from the @xmath143 channel , which is enhanced by the weakly bound biexciton . \n triplet - excitons in a relative @xmath144 state are spatially antisymmetric and thus have no s - wave scattering . \n we show s - wave scattering of triplet - excitons from singlet - excitons in fig . \n [ cs1fig](c ) . \n this state has two distinguishable excitons , and can scatter by both s - wave and p - wave processes . as can be seen in table [ scattab ] , the only contribution to the cross section is from the weaker @xmath145 channel . \n the coefficient for s - wave scattering is particularly small because only half the scattering process is symmetric ( s - wave ) , and there is an additional factor of one - half which cancels the identical particle factor . \n there is also an triplet- to singlet - exciton conversion cross section given in fig . \n [ cs1fig](d ) . \n although this is an inelastic process in experimental situations , it conserves energy according to our model hamiltonian because we do not have an explicit interband spin coupling . \n the conversion of two triplet - excitons to two singlet - excitons can be understood as an inter - exciton exchange of a pair of electrons ( or holes ) . \n since the spins of the individual excitons do not correspond to symmetries of the hamiltonian , they need not remain constant during scattering . \n this conversion process is a physical consequence of the two inequivalent scattering channels @xmath143 and @xmath145 . \n this effect has been reported in experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite work on exciton scattering in quantum wells .       and @xmath146 as a function of the electron - hole mass ratio . \n the divergence in @xmath147 near @xmath148 is due to the appearance of second bound biexciton state . \n solid lines are a guide to the eye . ]    the dependence of the cross sections on mass may be numerically studied by our methods . in fig . \n [ avmfig ] we show our calculated @xmath147 and @xmath146 as a function of mass ratio , @xmath149 . \n we find that the scattering length is remarkably insensitive to the mass ratio for @xmath150 ( corresponding to a wide range of semiconductors ) , but then diverges near @xmath151 . \n this feature is lost in previously published theoretical treatments of exciton - exciton scattering . \n the divergence in @xmath147 near @xmath148 is due to the acquisition of a biexciton vibrational state . for @xmath119 \n the biexciton has no bound excited states , while a @xmath152 molecule has 15 bound vibrational states . \n our calculations have shown the first of these appears near @xmath148 , with dramatic effects on the scattering length . \n the @xmath146 curve is relatively featureless because there are are no bound antisymmetric states in this range . \n we interpret the upward drift of @xmath146 for larger mass ratios as a systematic error due to difficulties in projecting states in excitonic systems with very different electron and hole masses . \n the heavy particle determines the projection time @xmath153 while the light particle determines the diffusion time step @xmath73 . \n the difficulty in handling large mass ratios make the method ( as presented here ) complementary to calculations that use the born - oppenheimer approximation . \n it is important to realize that similar relationships must exist between the scattering length and other material parameters , such as the luttinger - kohn parameters describing realistic hole states , external strain , and spin - orbit coupling , to name a few . \n theoretical studies of such effects will need similar high - accuracy scattering calculations , but applied to more accurate hamiltonians , and are an area for future research . \n to summarize , we have shown that there are several significant elastic scattering processes for excitons , and have given numerically exact values for a widely used theoretical model . \n we find strong triplet - triplet and singlet - singlet scattering , with weaker triplet - singlet scattering and triplet - triplet to singlet - singlet conversion processes . \n scattering is relatively insensitive to the mass ratio for @xmath154 , but becomes very sensitive and actually diverges near @xmath155 . \n dmc has been found be a good tool for this four - particle excited state calculation , since the detection of weakly bound states requires very accurate evaluation of the correlation energy . \n this computational approach should be extended in many ways . \n the extension to higher angular momentum states would give important corrections at higher scattering energies . \n application to biexciton - biexciton scattering are possible , but would be a bit more difficult because the scattering wavefunction would then have to describe eight interacting particles . \n most importantly , the method should be adapted to better hamiltonians so that the sensitivity of the scattering length to material properties for a wide range of materials can be studied . \n this approach should be quite useful for quantum well problems , which have similarities to the bulk problem study here , but have many more experimental parameters that can affect exciton -

        "abstract": "This paper examines exciton-exciton scattering in semiconductors, a critical phenomenon for understanding the behavior of dilute exciton gases and their thermalization processes. Scattering lengths, which are challenging to measure or estimate due to their sensitivity to interaction specifics, are analyzed through a highly accurate solution to the four-particle scattering problem using a single-band effective mass Hamiltonian. The study explores the dependency of scattering lengths on mass ratios, spin states, and inter-exciton electron or hole exchanges. It provides a theoretical framework to predict exciton-exciton scattering lengths accurately, offering a benchmark for more complex Hamiltonians and improving our understanding of excitonic interactions in various semiconductor materials."

        "article": "inflation generically predicts a primordial spectrum of density perturbations which is almost precisely gaussian @xcite . in recent years \n the small non - gaussian component @xcite has emerged as an important observable @xcite , and will be measured with good precision by the _ \n planck surveyor _ satellite @xcite . in the near future , \n as observational data become more plentiful , it will be important to understand the non - gaussian signal expected in a wide variety of models , and to anticipate what conclusions can be drawn about early - universe physics from a prospective detection of primordial non - gaussianity .    in this paper \n , we present a novel method for calculating the primordial non - gaussianity produced by super - horizon evolution in two - field models of inflation . \n our method is based on the real - space distribution of inflationary field values on a flat hypersurface , which can be thought of as a probability density function whose evolution is determined by a form of the collisionless boltzmann equation . using a cumulant representation @xcite to expand our density function around an exact gaussian \n , we derive ordinary differential equations which evolve the moments of this distribution . \n further , we show how these moments are related to observable quantities , such as the dimensionless bispectrum measured by @xmath1 @xcite . \n we present numerical results which show that this method gives good agreement with other techniques . \n it is not necessary to make any assumptions about the inflationary model beyond requiring a canonical kinetic term and applying the slow - roll approximation . \n while there are already numerous methods for computing the super - horizon contribution to @xmath1 , including the widely used @xmath0 formalism , we believe the one reported here has a number of advantages . \n first , this new technique is ideally suited to unraveling the various contributions to @xmath1 . \n this is because we follow the moments of the inflaton distribution directly , which makes it straightforward to identify large contributions to the skewness or other moments . \n the evolution equation for each moment is simple and possesses clearly identifiable source terms , which are related to the properties of the inflationary flow on field space . \n this offers a clear separation between two key sources of primordial non - gaussianity . \n one of these is the intrinsic non - linearity associated with evolution of the probability density function between successive flat hypersurfaces ; the other is a gauge transformation from field fluctuations to the curvature peturbation , @xmath2 . \n it would be difficult or impossible to observe this split within the context of other calculational schemes , such as the conventional @xmath0 formalism . \n a second advantage of our method is connected with the computational cost of numerical implementation . \n analytic formulas for @xmath1 are known in certain cases , mostly in the context of the @xmath0 framework , but only for very specific choices of the potential @xcite or hubble rate @xcite . \n these formulas become increasingly cumbersome as the number of fields increases , or if one studies higher moments @xcite . in the future , it seems clear that studies of complex models with many fields will increasingly rely on numerical methods . \n the numerical @xmath0 framework requires the solution to a number of ordinary differential equations which scales exponentially with the number of fields . \n since some models include hundreds of fields , this may present a significant obstacle @xcite . \n moreover , the @xmath0 formalism depends crucially on a numerical integration algorithm with low noise properties , since finite differences must be extracted between perturbatively different initial conditions after @xmath3 e - folds of evolution . \n thus , the background equations must be solved to great accuracy , since any small error has considerable scope to propagate .    in this paper \n we ultimately solve our equations numerically to determine the evolution of moments in specific models . \n our method requires the solution to a number of differential equations which scales at most polynomially ( or in certain cases perhaps even linearly ) with the number of fields . \n it does not rely on extracting finite differences , and therefore is much less susceptible to numerical noise . \n these advantages may be shared with other schemes , such as the numerical method recently employed by lehners & renaux - petel @xcite . \n a third advantage , to which we hope to return in a future publication , is that our formalism yields explicit evolution equations with source terms . from an analysis of these source terms , we hope that it will be possible to identify those physical features of specific models which lead to the production of large non - gaussianities . \n this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : computing_fnl ] , we show how the non - gaussian parameter @xmath1 can be computed in our framework . \n the calculation remains in real space throughout ( as opposed to fourier space ) , which modifies the relationship between @xmath1 and the multi - point functions of the inflaton field . \n our expression for @xmath1 shows a clean separation between different contributions to non - gaussianity , especially between the intrinsic nonlinearity of the field evolution and the gauge transformation between comoving and flat hypersurfaces . in  [ sec : transport ] , we introduce our model for the distribution of inflaton field values , which is a  moment expansion \" around a purely gaussian distribution . \n we derive the equations which govern the evolution of the moments of this distribution in the one- and two - field cases . in  [ sec : numerics ] , we present a comparison of our new technique and those already in the literature . we compute @xmath1 numerically in several two - field models , and find excellent agreement between techniques . \n we conclude in  [ s : conclusions ] .    throughout this paper \n , we use units in which @xmath4 , and the reduced planck mass @xmath5 is set to unity . \n in this section , we introduce our new method for computing the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath1 . \n this method requires three main ingredients : a formula for the curvature perturbation , @xmath2 , in terms of the field values on a spatially flat hypersurface ; expressions for the derivatives of the number of e - foldings , @xmath6 , as a function of field values at horizon exit ; and a prescription for evolving the field distribution from horizon exit to the time when we require the statistical properties of @xmath2 . \n the first two ingredients are given in eqs . \n and  , found at the end of  [ ss : sep_universe ] and  [ sec : derivative - n ] respectively . \n the final ingredient is discussed in  [ sec : transport ] .      once it became clear that non - linearities of the microwave background anisotropies could be detected by the wmap and _ planck _ survey satellites @xcite , many authors studied higher - order correlations of the curvature perturbation . in early work , direct calculations of a correlation function were matched to the known limit of local non - gaussianity @xcite . \n this method works well if isocurvature modes are absent , so that the curvature perturbation is constant after horizon exit . in the more realistic situation that isocurvature modes cause evolution on superhorizon scales , all correlation functions become time dependent . \n various formalisms have been employed to describe this evolution . \n lyth & rodrguez @xcite extended the @xmath0 method @xcite beyond linear order . \n this method is simple and well - suited to analytical calculation . \n rigopoulos , shellard and van tent @xcite worked with a gradient expansion , rewriting the field equations in langevin form . \n the noise term was used as a proxy for setting initial conditions at horizon crossing . \n a similar ` exact ' gradient formalism was written down by langlois & vernizzi @xcite . in its perturbative form \n , this approach has been used by lehners & renaux - petel to obtain numerical results @xcite . \n another numerical scheme has been introduced by huston & malik @xcite . \n what properties do we require of a successful prediction ? consider a typical observer , drawn at random from an ensemble of realizations of inflation . in any of the formalisms \n discussed above , we aim to estimate the statistical properties of the curvature perturbation which would be measured by such an observer . \n some realizations may yield statistical properties which are quite different from the ensemble average , but these large excursions are uninteresting unless anthropic arguments are in play . \n next we introduce a collection of comparably - sized spacetime volumes whose mutual scatter is destined to dominate the microwave background anisotropy on a given scale . \n neglecting spatial gradients , each spacetime volume will follow a trajectory in field space which is slightly displaced from its neighbors . \n the scatter between trajectories is determined by initial conditions set at horizon exit , which are determined by promoting the vacuum fluctuation to a classical perturbation . \n a correct prediction is a function of the trajectories followed by every volume in the collection , taken as a whole . \n one never makes a prediction for a single trajectory . \n each spacetime volume follows a trajectory , which we label with its position @xmath7 at some fixed time , to be made precise below . throughout this paper , \n superscript ` @xmath8 ' denotes evaluation on a spatially flat hypersurface . \n consider the evolution of some quantity of interest , @xmath9 , which is a function of trajectory . \n if we know the distribution @xmath10 we can study statistical properties of @xmath9 such as the @xmath11 moment @xmath12 , @xmath13^m , \\ ] ] where we have introduced the ensemble average of @xmath9 , @xmath14 in eqs .   , @xmath7 stands for a collection of any number of fields . \n it is the @xmath12 which are observable quantities . \n .   defines what we will call the exact separate universe picture . \n it is often convenient to expand @xmath15 as a power series in the field values centered on a fiducial trajectory , labelled ` fid , ' @xmath16 when eq . \n is used to evaluate the @xmath12 , we refer to the ` perturbative ' separate universe picture . \n if all terms in the power series are retained , these two versions of the calculation are formally equivalent . in unfavorable cases , however , convergence may occur slowly or not at all . \n this possibility was discussed in refs . \n although our calculation is formally perturbative , it is not directly equivalent to eq .  . \n we briefly discuss the relation of our calculation to conventional perturbation theory in \n [ s : conclusions ] .      by definition , the curvature perturbation @xmath2 measures local fluctuations in expansion history ( expressed in e - folds @xmath6 ) , calculated on a comoving hypersurface . in many models , the curvature perturbation is synthesized by superhorizon physics , which reprocesses a set of gaussian fluctuations generated at horizon exit . in a single - field model \n , only one gaussian fluctuation can be present , which we label @xmath17 . neglecting spatial gradients , the total curvature perturbation \n must then be a function of @xmath17 alone . for @xmath18 \n , this can be well - approximated by @xmath19 where @xmath1 is independent of spatial position . \n defines the so - called `` local '' form of non - gaussianity . \n it applies only when quantum interference effects can be neglected , making @xmath2 a well - defined object rather than a superposition of operators @xcite . \n if this condition is satisfied , spatial correlations of @xmath2 may be extracted and it follows that @xmath1 can be estimated using the rule @xmath20 where we have recalled that @xmath2 is nearly gaussian , or equivalently that @xmath21 .    with @xmath1 spatially independent , eq .   strictly applies only in single - field inflation . in this case \n one can accurately determine @xmath1 by applying eq .   to a single trajectory with fixed initial conditions , as in the method of lehners & renaux - petel @xcite . \n where more than one field is present , @xmath1 may vary in space because it depends on the isocurvature modes . in this case \n one must determine @xmath1 statistically on a bundle of adjacent trajectories which sample the local distribution of isocurvature modes . \n is then indispensible . \n following maldacena @xcite , and later lyth & rodrguez @xcite , we adopt eq .   as our definition of @xmath1 , whatever its origin . in real space , the coefficient @xmath22 in eq . \n depends on the convention @xmath23 . \n more generally , this follows from the definition of @xmath12 , eq .  . \n in fourier space , either prescription is automatically enforced after dropping disconnected contributions , again leading to eq .  .    to proceed , we require estimates of the correlation functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n we first describe the conventional approach , in which ` @xmath8 ' denotes a flat hypersurface at a fixed initial time . \n the quantity @xmath26 denotes the number of e - foldings between this initial slice and a final comoving hypersurface , where @xmath27 indexes the species of light scalar fields . \n the local variation in expansion can be written in the fiducial picture as @xmath28 where @xmath29 . \n subject to the condition that the relevant scales are all outside the horizon , we are free to choose the initial time  set by the hypersurface ` @xmath8'at our convenience . in the conventional approach , ` @xmath8 ' is taken to lie a few e - folds after our collection of spacetime volumes passes outside the causal horizon @xcite . \n this choice has many virtues . \n first , we need to know statistical properties of the field fluctuations @xmath30 only around the time of horizon crossing , where they can be computed without the appearance of large logarithms @xcite . \n second , as a consequence of the slow - roll approximation , the @xmath31 are uncorrelated at this time , leading to algebraic simplifications . \n finally , the @xmath0 formula subsumes a gauge transformation from the field variables @xmath30 to the observational variable @xmath2 . using eqs .   , and \n , one finds that @xmath1 can be written to a good approximation @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 and for simplicity we have dropped the ` @xmath8 ' which indicates time of evaluation . \n a similar definition applies for @xmath34 . \n .   is accurate up to small intrinsic non - gaussianities present in the field fluctuations at horizon exit . as a means of predicting @xmath1 \n it is pleasingly compact , and straightforward to evaluate in many models . \n unfortunately , it also obscures the physics which determines @xmath35 . for this reason it is hard to infer , from eq .   alone , those classes of models in which @xmath35 is always large or small . \n is dynamically allowed . \n see , for example , refs . \n @xcite . ] \n our strategy is quite different . \n we choose ` @xmath8 ' to lie around the time when we require the statistical properties of @xmath2 . \n the role of the @xmath0 formula , eq .  , is then to encode _ only _ the gauge transformation between the @xmath36 and @xmath2 . in \n [ sec : derivative - n ] below , we show how the appropriate gauge transformation is computed using the @xmath0 formula . in the present section \n we restrict our attention to determining a formula for @xmath1 under the assumption that the distribution of field values on ` @xmath8 ' is known . in  [ sec : transport ] , we will supply the required prescription to evolve the distribution of field values between horizon exit and ` @xmath8 ' . \n although the @xmath31 are independent random variables at horizon exit , correlations can be induced by subsequent evolution . \n one must therefore allow for off - diagonal terms in the two - point function . \n remembering that we are working with a collection of spacetime volumes in real space , smoothed on some characteristic scale , we write @xmath37 @xmath38 does not vary in space , but it may be a function of the scale which characterizes our ensemble of spacetime volumes . in all but the simplest models it will vary in time . \n it is also necessary to account for intrinsic non - linearities among the @xmath31 , which are small at horizon crossing but may grow . we define @xmath39 likewise , @xmath40 should be regarded as a function of time and scale . \n the permutation symmetries of an expectation value such as   guarantee that , for example , @xmath41 . \n when written explicitly , we place the indices of symbols such as @xmath42 in numerical order . neglecting a small ( @xmath43 ) intrinsic four - point correlation , it follows that @xmath44    now we specialize to a two - field model , parametrized by fields @xmath45 and @xmath46 . using eqs . \n , and  , it follows that the two - point function of @xmath2 satisfies @xmath47 the three - point function can be written @xmath48 where we have identified two separate contributions , labelled ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' . \n the ` 1 ' term includes all contributions involving _ intrinsic _ non - linearities , those which arise from non - gaussian correlations among the field fluctuations , @xmath49 the ` 2 ' term encodes non - linearities arising directly from the gauge transformation to @xmath2 @xmath50 after use of eq .  , \n can be used to extract the non - linearity parameter @xmath1 . \n this decomposes likewise into two contributions @xmath51 , which we shall discuss in more detail in \n [ sec : numerics ] .      to compute @xmath1 in concrete models , \n we require expressions for the derivatives @xmath52 and @xmath34 . for generic initial and final times , these are difficult to obtain . \n lyth & rodrguez @xcite used direct integration , which is effective for quadratic potentials and constant slow - roll parameters . \n vernizzi & wands @xcite obtained expressions in a two - field model with an arbitrary sum - separable potential by introducing gaussian normal coordinates on the space of trajectories . \n their approach was generalized to many fields by battefeld & easther @xcite . \n product - separable potentials can be accommodated using the same technique @xcite . \n an alternative technique has been proposed by yokoyama _ \n _ @xcite . \n a considerable simplification occurs in the present case , because we only require the derivative evaluated between flat and comoving hypersurfaces which coincide in the unperturbed universe . for any species @xmath27 , and \n to leading order in the slow - roll approximation , the number of e - folds @xmath6 between the flat hypersurface ` @xmath8 ' and a comoving hypersurface ` @xmath53 ' satisfies @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the field values evaluated on ` @xmath8 ' and ` @xmath53 , ' respectively . under an infinitesimal shift of @xmath57 \n , we deduce that @xmath52 obeys @xmath58 note that this applies for an arbitrary @xmath59 , which need not factorize into a sum or product of potentials for the individual species @xmath27 . in principle a contribution from variation of the integrand is present , which spoils a nave attempt to generalize the method of refs . \n @xcite to an arbitrary potential . \n this contribution vanishes in virtue of our supposition that ` @xmath8 ' and ` @xmath53 ' are infinitesimally separated .    to compute @xmath60 it is helpful to introduce a quantity @xmath61 , which in the sum - separable case coincides with the conserved quantity of vernizzi & wands @xcite . for our specific choice of a two - field model , this takes the form @xmath62 where the integrals are evaluated on a single spatial hypersurface . in an @xmath63-field model , one would obtain @xmath64 conserved quantities which label the isocurvature fields . \n the construction of these quantities is discussed in refs . \n @xcite . for sum - separable potentials one can show using the equations of motion that @xmath61 is conserved under time evolution to leading order in slow - roll . \n it is not conserved for general potentials , but the variation can be neglected for infinitesimally separated hypersurfaces .    under a change of trajectory , \n @xmath61 varies according to the rules @xmath65 and @xmath66 the comoving hypersurface ` @xmath53 ' is defined by @xmath67 we are assuming that the slow - roll approximation applies , so that the kinetic energy may be neglected in comparison with the potential @xmath59 . \n therefore on ` @xmath53 ' we have @xmath68 combining eqs .  , and   we obtain expressions for @xmath60 , namely @xmath69 where we have defined @xmath70 eqs . \n can alternatively be derived without use of @xmath61 by comparing eq .   with the formulas of ref . \n @xcite , which were derived using conventional perturbation theory . \n applying  , we obtain @xmath71 to proceed , we require the second derivatives of @xmath6 . \n these can be obtained directly from  , after use of eqs . \n . we find @xmath72^\\star          \\cos^2 \\theta           + 2 \\left ( \\frac{v}{v_{,1 } } \\right)^{\\star 2 }          \\cos^2 \\theta \\\\ \n \\hspace{-6 mm }          \\mbox { } \\times \\left [              \\frac{v_{,11}}{v } \\sin^2 \\theta              - \\frac{v_{,1 } v_{,12}}{v v_{,2 } } \\sin^4 \\theta              - \\left (                  \\frac{v_{,11}}{v } - \\frac{v_{,22}}{v }                  + \\frac{v_{,2 } v_{,12}}{v v_{,1 } }              \\right )              \\cos^2 \\theta \\sin^2 \\theta          \\right]^c . \n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an analogous expression for @xmath73 can be obtained after the simultaneous exchange @xmath74 . \n the mixed derivative satisfies @xmath75^c \\\\ \\hspace{-6 mm }          \\mbox { } + \\cos^2 \\theta \\left (              \\frac{v_{,2}}{v_{,1 } } - \\frac{v v_{,12}}{v_{,1}^2 }          \\right)^c .      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now that the calculation is complete , we can drop the superscripts ` @xmath8 ' and ` @xmath53 , ' since any background quantity is the same on either hypersurface . \n once this is done it can be verified that ( despite appearances ) eq . \n is invariant under the exchange @xmath76 . \n in this section we return to the problem of evolution between horizon exit and the time of observation , and supply the prescription which connects the distribution of field values at these two times . \n we begin by discussing the single - field system , which lacks the technical complexity of the two - field case , yet still exhibits certain interesting features which recur there . among these features \n are the subtle difference between motion of the statistical mean and the background field value , and the hierarchy of moment evolution equations . \n moreover , the structure of the moment mixing equations is similar to that which obtains in the two - field case . \n for this reason , the one - field scenario provides an instructive example of the techniques we wish to employ . \n recall that we work in real space with a collection of comparably sized spacetime volumes , each with a slightly different expansion history , and the scatter in these histories determines the microwave background anisotropy on a given angular scale . within each volume \n the smoothed background field @xmath77 takes a uniform value described by a density function @xmath78 , where in this section we are dropping the superscript ` @xmath8 ' denoting evaluation of spatially flat hypersurfaces . \n our ultimate goal is to calculate the reduced bispectrum , @xmath1 , which describes the third moment of @xmath78 . in the language of probability \n this is the skewness , which we denote @xmath42 . \n a gaussian distribution has skewness zero , and inflation usually predicts that the skew is small . \n for this reason , rather than seek a distribution with non - zero third moment , as proposed in ref . \n @xcite , we will introduce higher moments as perturbative corrections to the gaussian . \n such a procedure is known as a _ \n cumulant expansion_.    the construction of cumulant expansions is a classical problem in probability theory . \n we seek a distribution with centroid @xmath79 , variance @xmath80 , and skew @xmath42 , with all higher moments determined by @xmath81 and @xmath42 alone . \n a distribution with suitable properties is @xmath82 , \\ ] ] where @xmath83\\ ] ] is a pure gaussian and @xmath84 denotes the @xmath85 hermite polynomial , for which there are multiple normalization conventions . \n we choose to normalize so that @xmath86 which implies that the leading term of @xmath87 is @xmath88 . \n this is sometimes called the `` probabilist s convention . '' \n we define expectation values @xmath89 by the usual rule , @xmath90 the probability density function in eq . \n has the properties , and do not depend on the approximation that @xmath42 is small . \n however , for large @xmath42 the density function   may become negative for some values of @xmath77 . \n it then ceases to be a probability density in the strict sense . \n this does not present a problem in practice , since we are interested in distributions which are approximately gaussian , and for which @xmath42 will typically be small . moreover , our principal use of eq . \n is as a formal tool to extract evolution equations for each moment . \n for this reason we will not worry whether @xmath78 defines an honest probability density function in the strict mathematical sense . ] \n @xmath91 the moments @xmath79 , @xmath81 , and @xmath42 may be time - dependent , so evolution of the probability density in time can be accommodated by finding evolution equations for these quantities . \n the density function given in eq . \n is well - known and has been applied in many situations . \n it is a solution to the problem of approximating a nearly - gaussian distribution whose moments are known . \n ( [ e : p1d ] ) is in fact the first two terms of the _ gram  charlier ` a ' series _ , also sometimes called the _ \n hermite series_. in recent years it has found multiple applications to cosmology , of which our method is closest to that of taylor & watts @xcite . \n other applications are discussed in refs . \n @xcite . for a review of the ` \n a ' series and related nearly - gaussian probability distributions from an astrophysical perspective , see @xcite . in this paper \n , we will refer to eq .   and its natural generalization to higher moments as the `` moment expansion . ''    in the slow - roll approximation \n , the field in each spacetime volume obeys a simple equation of motion @xmath92 where @xmath6 records the number of e - foldings of expansion . \n we refer to @xmath93 as the velocity field . \n expanding @xmath94 about the instantaneous centroid @xmath79 gives @xmath95 where @xmath96 the value of @xmath79 evolves with time , so each expansion coefficient is time - dependent . \n hence , we do not assume that the velocity field is _ globally _ well - described by a quadratic taylor expansion , but merely that it is well - described as such in the neighborhood of the instantaneous centroid . \n we expand the velocity field to second order , although in principle this expansion could be carried to arbitrary order . \n it remains to specify how the probability density evolves in time . \n conservation of probability leads to the transport equation @xmath97 eq . \n can also be understood as the limit of a chapman \n kolmogorov process as the size of each hop goes to zero . \n it is well known  for example , from the study of starobinsky s diffusion equation which forms the basis of the stochastic approach to inflation @xcite  that the choice of time variable in this equation is significant , with different choices corresponding to the selection of a temporal gauge . \n we have chosen to use the e - folding time , @xmath6 , which means that we are evolving the distribution on hypersurfaces of uniform expansion . \n these are the spatially flat hypersurfaces whose field perturbations enter the @xmath0 formulas described in  [ sec : computing_fnl ] .    in principle , eq . \n can be solved directly . in practice \n it is simpler to extract equations for the moments of @xmath98 , giving evolution equations for @xmath79 , @xmath81 and @xmath42 . to achieve this , one need only resolve eq \n .   into a hermite series of the form @xmath99 the hermite polynomials are linearly independent , and application of the orthogonality condition   shows that the @xmath100 must all vanish . \n this leads to a hierarchy of equations @xmath101 , which we refer to as the moment hierarchy . at the top of the hierarchy , \n the equation @xmath102 is empty and expresses conservation of probability . \n the first non - trivial equation requires @xmath103 and yields an evolution equation for the centroid @xmath79 , @xmath104 the first term on the right - hand side drives the centroid along the velocity field , as one would anticipate based on the background equation of motion , eq .  . \n however , the second term shows that the centroid is also influenced as the wings of the probability distribution probe the nearby velocity field . \n this influence is not captured by the background equation of motion . \n if we are in a situation with @xmath105 , then the wings of the density function will be moving faster than the center . \n hence , the velocity of the centroid will be larger than one might expect by restricting attention to @xmath79 . \n accordingly , the mean fluctuation value is not following a solution to the background equations of motion . \n evolution equations for the variance @xmath80 and skew @xmath42 are obtained after enforcing @xmath106 , yielding @xmath107 in both equations , the first term on the right - hand sides describes how @xmath81 and @xmath42 scale as the density function expands or contracts in response to the velocity field . \n these terms force @xmath80 and @xmath42 to scale in proportion to the velocity field . specifically , \n if we temporarily drop the second terms in each equation above , one finds that @xmath108 and @xmath109 . \n this precisely matches our expectation for the scaling of these quantities . \n hence , these terms account for the jacobians associated with infinitesimal transformations induced by the flow @xmath93 .    for applications to inflationary non - gaussianity , \n the second terms in   and   are more relevant . \n these terms describe how each moment is sourced by higher moments and the interaction of the density function with the velocity field . in the example \n above , if we are in a situation where @xmath105 , the tails of the density function are moving faster than the core . \n this means that one tail is shrinking and the other is extending , skewing the probability density . \n the opposite occurs when @xmath110 . \n these effects are measured by the second term in  . \n hence , by expanding our pdf to the third moment , and our velocity field to quadratic order , we are able to construct a set of evolution equations which include the leading - order source terms for each moment .      there is little conceptually new as we move from one field to two . \n the new features are mostly technical in nature . \n our primary challenge is a generalization of the moment expansion to two fields , allowing for the possibility of correlation between the fields . with this done , \n we can write down evolution equations whose structure is very similar to those found in the single - field case .    the two - field system is described by a two - dimensional velocity field @xmath111 , defined by @xmath112 where again we are using the number of e - folds @xmath6 as the time variable . \n the index @xmath27 takes values in @xmath113 . while we think it is likely that our equations generalize to any number of fields , we have only explicitly constructed them for a two - field system . as will become clear below , certain steps in this construction apply only for two fields , and \n hence we make no claims at present concerning examples with three or more fields . \n the two - dimensional transport equation is @xmath114          =          0 .\\ ] ] here and in the following we have returned to our convention that repeated species indices are summed . as in the single - field case , we construct a probability distribution which is nearly gaussian , but has a small non -

point correlations of the fields , @xmath123    all skewnesses are encoded in @xmath124 . before defining this explicitly , \n it is helpful to pause and notice a complication inherent in eqs .   which was not present in the single - field case . to extract a hierarchy of moment evolution equations from the transport equation , eq . \n , we made the expansion given in   and argued that orthogonality of the hermite polynomials implied the hierarchy @xmath101 . \n however , hermite polynomials of the form @xmath125 $ ] are _ not _ orthogonal under the gaussian measure of eq .  . \n following an expansion analogous to eq . \n the moment hierarchy would comprise linear combinations of the coefficients . \n the problem is essentially an algebraic question of gram \n schmidt orthogonalization .    to avoid this problem \n it is convenient to diagonalize the covariance matrix @xmath119 , introducing new variables @xmath126 and @xmath127 for which eq . \n factorizes into the product of two measures under which the polynomials @xmath128 and @xmath129 are separately orthogonal . \n the necessary redefinitions are @xmath130\\ ] ] and @xmath131 .\\ ] ] a simple expression for @xmath116 can be given in terms of @xmath126 and @xmath127 , @xmath132 we now define the non - gaussian factor , which encodes the skewnesses , to be @xmath133 in these variables we find @xmath134 , but @xmath135 . \n in addition , we have @xmath136    in order for eq . \n to be useful , it is necessary to express the skewnesses associated with the physical variables @xmath137 in terms of @xmath126 and @xmath127 . by definition , \n these satisfy @xmath138 after substituting for the definition of these quantities inside the expectation values in eq . \n we arrive at the relations @xmath139 the moments @xmath118 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 are time - dependent , but for clarity we will usually suppress this in our notation . \n next we must extract the moment hierarchy , which governs evolution of @xmath118 , @xmath140 , @xmath121 and @xmath40 . \n we expand the velocity field in a neighborhood of the instantaneous centroid @xmath118 according to @xmath141 where we have defined @xmath142 as in the single - field case , these coefficients are functions of time and vary with the motion of the centroid . \n the expansion can be pursued to higher order if desired . \n our construction of @xmath126 and @xmath127 implies that the two - field transport equation can be arranged as a double gauss  hermite expansion , @xmath143          =          p_g \\sum_{m , n \\ge 0 } c_{mn } h_m(x ) h_n(y )          =          0 .\\ ] ] because the hermite polynomials are orthogonal in the measure defined by @xmath116 , we deduce the moment hierarchy @xmath144    we define the  rank \" @xmath145 of each coefficient @xmath146 by @xmath147 . \n we terminated the velocity field expansion at quadratic order , and our probability distribution included only the first three moments . \n it follows that only @xmath146 with rank five or less are nonzero . \n if we followed the velocity field to higher order , or included higher terms in the moment expansion , we would obtain non - trivial higher - rank coefficients . \n inclusion of additional coefficients requires no qualitative modification of our analysis and can be incorporated in the scheme we describe below .    a useful feature of the expansion in eq . \n is that the rank-@xmath145 coefficients give evolution equations for the order-@xmath145 moments . written explicitly in components , \n the expressions that result from   are quite cumbersome . \n however , when written as field - space covariant expressions they can be expressed in a surprisingly compact form . \n : :    the rank-0 coefficient @xmath148 is identically zero . \n this    expresses the fact that the total probability is conserved as the    distribution evolves . : :    the rank-1 coefficients @xmath149 and @xmath150    give evolution equations for the centroid @xmath118 . \n these    equations can be written in the form @xmath151 we remind the    reader that here and below , terms like @xmath152 ,    @xmath153 and @xmath154 represent the velocity    field and its derivatives evaluated at the centroid    @xmath118 . \n the first term in expresses the non - anomalous    motion of the centroid , which coincides with the background velocity    field of eq .  . \n the second term describes how the wings of the    probability distribution sample the velocity field at nearby points . \n narrow probability distributions have small components of    @xmath119 and hence are only sensitive to the local value    of @xmath155 . \n broad probability distributions have    large components of @xmath119 and are therefore more    sensitive to the velocity field far from the centroid . : :    the rank-2 coefficients @xmath156 , @xmath157 and    @xmath158 give evolution equations for the variances    @xmath120 and the correlation @xmath121 . \n these    can conveniently be packaged as evolution equations for the matrix    @xmath119 @xmath159 this equation describes the stretching and    rotation of @xmath119 as it is transported by the velocity    field . \n it includes a sensitivity to the wings of the probability    distribution , in a manner analogous to the similar term appearing in  . \n hence the skew @xmath40 acts as a source for the    correlation matrix . \n : :    the rank-3 coefficients @xmath160 , @xmath161 ,    @xmath162 and @xmath163 describe evolution of    the moments @xmath40 . \n these are    @xmath164 the first term describes how the moments flow    into each other as the velocity field rotates and shears the    @xmath165 coordinate frame relative to the    @xmath137 coordinate frame . \n the second term describes    sourcing of non - gaussianity from inhomogeneities in the velocity field    and the overall spread of the probability distribution . \n some higher - rank coefficients  in our case , those of ranks four and five  are also nonzero , but do not give any new evolution equations . \n these coefficients measure the  error \" introduced by truncating the moment expansion . \n if we had included higher cumulants , these higher - rank coefficients would have given evolution equations for the higher moments of the probability distribution . \n in general , all moments of the density function will mix so it is always necessary to terminate our expansion at a predetermined order both in cumulants and powers of the field fluctuation . \n the order we have chosen is sufficient to generate evolution equations containing both the leading - order behavior of the moments  namely , the first terms in eqs .  , and  and the leading corrections , given by the latter terms in these equations . \n at this point we put our new method into practice . \n we study two models for which the non - gaussian signal is already known , using the standard @xmath0 formula . for each case \n we employ our method and compare it with results obtained using @xmath0 . to ensure a fair comparison , we solve numerically in both cases . \n our new method employs the slow - roll approximation , as described above . \n therefore , when using the @xmath0 approach we produce results both with and without slow - roll simplifications . \n first consider double quadratic inflation , which was studied by rigopoulos , shellard & van tent @xcite and later by vernizzi & wands @xcite . \n the potential is @xmath166 we use the initial conditions chosen in ref . \n @xcite , where @xmath167 , and the fiducial trajectory has coordinates @xmath168 and @xmath169 . \n we plot the evolution of @xmath1 in fig . \n [ fig1 ] , which also shows the prediction of the standard @xmath0 formula ( with and without employing slow roll simplifications ) . \n we implement the @xmath0 algorithm using a finite difference method to calculate the derivatives of @xmath6 . \n a similar technique was used in ref . \n this model yields a very modest non - gaussian signal , below unity even at its peak . \n if inflation ends away from the spike then @xmath1 is practically negligible . \n shows that the method of moment transport allows us to separate contributions to @xmath1 from the intrinsic non - gaussianity of the field fluctuations , and non - linearities of the gauge transformation to @xmath2 . as explained in \n [ ss : sep_universe ] , we denote the former @xmath170 and the latter @xmath171 , and plot them separately in fig . \n [ fig2 ] .    inspection of this figure clearly shows that @xmath1 is determined by a cancellation between two much larger components . \n its final shape and magnitude are exquisitely sensitive to their relative phase . \n initially , the magnitudes of @xmath170 and @xmath171 grow , but their sum remains small . \n the peak in fig . \n [ fig1 ] arises from the peak of @xmath171 , which is incompletely cancelled by @xmath170 . \n it is remarkable that @xmath170 initially evolves in exact opposition to the gauge transformation , to which it is not obviously connected .    in the double quadratic model \n , @xmath1 is always small . \n however , it has recently been shown by byrnes _ \n _ that a large non - gaussian signal can be generated even when slow - roll is a good approximation @xcite \n . the conditions for this to occur are incompletely understood , but apparently require a specific choice of potential and strong tuning of initial conditions . in figs . \n [ fig3][fig4 ] we show the evolution of @xmath1 in a model with the potential @xmath172 which corresponds to example a of ref . \n *  5 ) when we choose @xmath173 and initial conditions @xmath174 , @xmath175 . \n it is clear that the agreement is exact .    in this model , @xmath1 is overwhelmingly dominated by the contribution from the second - order gauge transformation , @xmath171 , as shown in fig . \n [ fig4 ] . \n this conclusion applies equally to the other large-@xmath1 examples discussed in refs . \n @xcite , although we make no claim that this is a general phenomenon .    in conclusion , figs . \n [ fig1 ] and  [ fig3 ] show excellent agreement between our new method and the outcome of the numerical @xmath0 formula . \n these figures also compare the moment transport method and @xmath0 without the slow - roll approximation . \n we conclude that the slow - roll estimate remains broadly accurate throughout the entire evolution . \n non - linearities are now routinely extracted from all - sky observations of the microwave background anisotropy . \n our purpose in this paper has been to propose a new technique with which to predict the observable signal . \n present data already give interesting constraints on the skewness parameter @xmath1 , and over the next several years we expect that the _ planck _ survey satellite will make these constraints very stringent . it is even possible that higher - order moments , such as the kurtosis parameter @xmath176 @xcite will become better constrained @xcite . to meet the need of the observational community for comparison with theory , reliable estimates of these non - linear quantities will be necessary for various models of early - universe physics . \n a survey of the literature suggests that the ` conventional ' @xmath0 method , originally introduced by lyth & rodrguez , remains the method of choice for analytical study of non - gaussianity . in comparison , \n our proposed moment transport method exhibits several clear differences . \n first , the conventional method functions best when we base the @xmath0 expansion on a flat hypersurface immediately after horizon exit . in our method , we make the opposite choice and move the flat hypersurface as close as possible to the time of observation . after this , the role of the @xmath0 formula is to provide no more than the non - linear gauge transformation between field fluctuations and the curvature perturbation . \n we substitute the method of moment transport to evolve the distribution of field fluctuations between horizon exit and observation . \n second , in integrating the transport equation one uses an expansion of the velocity field such as the one given in eqs . \n . this expansion is refreshed at each step of integration , so the result is related to conventional perturbative calculations in a very similar way to renormalization - group improved perturbation theory @xcite . in this interpretation , \n derivatives of @xmath111 play the role of couplings . at a given order , @xmath177 , in the moment hierarchy \n , the equations for lower - order moments function as renormalization group equations for the couplings at level-@xmath177 , resumming potentially large terms before they spoil perturbation theory . \n this property is shared with any formalism such as @xmath0 which is non - perturbative in time evolution , but may be an advantage in comparison with perturbative methods . \n we also note that although @xmath0 is non - perturbative as a point of principle , practical implementations are frequently perturbative . \n for example , the method of vernizzi & wands @xcite and battefeld & easther @xcite depends on the existence of quantities which are conserved only to leading order in @xmath178 , and can lose accuracy after @xmath179 e - foldings . \n numerical calculations confirm that our method gives results in excellent agreement with existing techniques . as a by - product of our analysis \n , we note that the large non - gaussianities which have recently been observed in sum- and product - separable potentials @xcite are dominated by non - linearities from the second - order part of the gauge transformation from @xmath180 to @xmath2 . \n the contribution from intrinsic non - linearities of the field fluctuations , measured by the skewnesses @xmath40 , is negligible . in such cases \n one can obtain a useful formula for @xmath1 by approximating the field distribution as an exact gaussian . \n the non - gaussianity produced in such cases arises from a distortion of comoving hypersurfaces with respect to adjacent spatially flat hypersurfaces . \n our new method joins many well - established techniques for estimating non - gaussian properties of the curvature perturbation . in our experience , these techniques give comparable estimates of @xmath1 , but they do not exactly agree . \n each method invokes different assumptions , such as the neglect of gradients or the degree to which time dependence can be accommodated . \n the mutual scatter between different methods can be attributed to the theory error inherent in any estimate of @xmath1 . \n the comparison presented in \n [ sec : numerics ] shows that while all of these methods slightly disagree , the moment transport method gives good agreement with other established methods . \n dm is supported by the cambridge centre for theoretical cosmology ( ctc ) . \n ds is funded by stfc . \n dw acknowledges support from the ctc . \n we would like to thank chris byrnes , jim lidsey and karim malik for helpful conversations . \n 10              t.  falk , r.  rangarajan , and m.  srednicki , _ the angular dependence of the three -

        "abstract": "This paper explores the primordial non-Gaussianity produced by super-horizon evolution in two-field models of inflation. We introduce a novel method based on the real-space distribution of inflationary field values, utilizing a cumulant expansion to evolve moments of this distribution. This method is computationally efficient, scales polynomially with the number of fields, and provides clear insights into the sources of primordial non-Gaussianity, distinguishing between intrinsic non-linearities and gauge transformations. Our results are consistent with existing methods and present a robust framework for understanding early-universe physics from observations of primordial non-Gaussianity."

        "abstract": "This study explores admissible sequences of lattice paths within a colored square grid, focusing on their combinatorial and algebraic structures. We demonstrate that the number of self-conjugate admissible sequences of paths corresponds to the count of standard Young tableaux of the same shape, utilizing the hook length formula. Extending beyond self-conjugate paths, we establish that the total number of admissible sequences equals the sum of squares of standard Young tableaux for partitions with specific height constraints. Furthermore, by leveraging the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence, these results connect to enumerating certain pattern-avoiding permutations. Additionally, the paper applies these findings to the representation theory of affine Kac-Moody algebras, confirming a conjectured relationship between the multiplicity of specific weights in modules and the combinatorics of lattice paths. This connection not only provides a new perspective on algebraic structures but also enriches the understanding of permutation patterns in combinatorial contexts."

positron collider with tunable energy ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and polarized beams in its first phase , and the gigaz option corresponds to its operation on top of the resonance of @xmath1 boson by adding a bypass to its main beam line . \n given the high luminosity , @xmath14 , and the cross section at the resonance of @xmath1 boson , @xmath15 , about @xmath16 @xmath1 events can be generated in an operational year of @xmath17 of gigaz , which implies that the expected sensitivity to the branching ratio of @xmath1-decay can be improved from @xmath18 at the lep to @xmath19 at the gigaz@xcite . in light of this , the @xmath1-boson properties , especially its exotic or rare decays which are widely believed to be sensitive to new physics , should be investigated comprehensively to evaluate their potential in probing new physics .    among the rare @xmath1-decays , the flavor changing ( fc ) processes were most extensively studied to explore the flavor texture in new physics @xcite , and it was found that , although these processes are severely suppressed in the sm , their branching ratios in new physics models can be greatly enhanced to @xmath19 for lepton flavor violation decays @xcite and @xmath20 for quark flavor violation decays @xcite . besides the fc processes \n , the @xmath1-decay into light higgs boson(s ) is another type of rare process that was widely studied , e.g. the decay @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) with the particle @xmath0 denoting a light higgs boson was studied in @xcite , the decay @xmath23 was studied in the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm)@xcite and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite , and the decay @xmath4 was studied in a model independent way @xcite , in 2hdm@xcite and also in mssm@xcite . \n these studies indicate that , in contrast with the kinematic forbidden of these decays in the sm , the rates of these decays can be as large as @xmath18 in new physics models , which lie within the expected sensitivity of the gigaz . in this work , \n we extend the previous studies of these decays to some new models and investigate these decays altogether . \n we are motivated by some recent studies on the singlet extension of the mssm , such as the next -

quuin symmetry @xcite . \n these non - minimal supersymmetric models can not only avoid the @xmath25-problem , but also alleviate the little hierarchy by having such a light higgs boson @xmath0 @xcite . \n we are also motivated by that , with the latest experiments , the properties of the light higgs boson are more stringently constrained than before . \n so it is worth updating the previous studies . \n so far there is no model - independent lower bound on the lightest higgs boson mass . in the sm \n , it must be heavier than @xmath26 gev , obtained from the null observation of the higgs boson at lep experiments . \n however , due to the more complex structure of the higgs sector in the extensions of the sm , this lower bound can be significantly relaxed according to recent studies , e.g. , for the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath0 we have @xmath27 gev in the nmssm @xcite , @xmath28 gev in the nmssm @xcite , and @xmath29 gev in the lepton - specific 2hdm ( l2hdm ) @xcite . with such a light cp - odd higgs boson , the z - decay into one or more \n @xmath0 is open up . noting that the decay @xmath30 is forbidden due to bose symmetry , we in this work study the rare @xmath1-decays @xmath6 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath31 and @xmath4 in a comparative way for four models , namely the type - ii 2hdm@xcite , the l2hdm @xcite , the nmssm and the nmssm . in our study \n , we examine carefully the constraints on the light @xmath0 from many latest experimental results . \n this work is organized as follows . in sec . \n ii we briefly describe the four new physics models . in sec . \n iii we present the calculations of the rare @xmath1-decays . in sec . \n iv we list the constraints on the four new physics models . in sec . \n v we show the numerical results for the branching ratios of the rare @xmath1-decays in various models . finally , the conclusion is given in sec . \n as the most economical way , the sm utilizes one higgs doublet to break the electroweak symmetry . as a result , \n the sm predicts only one physical higgs boson with its properties totally determined by two free parameters . in new physics models , \n the higgs sector is usually extended by adding higgs doublets and/or singlets , and consequently , more physical higgs bosons are predicted along with more free parameters involved in . \n the general 2hdm contains two @xmath32 doublet higgs fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and with the assumption of cp - conserving , its scalar potential can be parameterized as@xcite : @xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) are free dimensionless parameters , and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are the parameters with mass dimension . after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the spectrum of this higgs sector includes three massless goldstone modes , which become the longitudinal modes of @xmath40 and @xmath1 bosons , and five massive physical states : two cp - even higgs bosons @xmath41 and @xmath42 , one neutral cp - odd higgs particle @xmath0 and a pair of charged higgs bosons @xmath43 . noting the constraint @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 denoting the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , we choose @xmath47 as the input parameters with @xmath48 , and @xmath49 being the mixing angle that diagonalizes the mass matrix of the cp - even higgs fields . \n the difference between the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm comes from the yukawa coupling of the higgs bosons to quark / lepton . in the type - ii 2hdm \n , one higgs doublet @xmath34 generates the masses of up - type quarks and the other doublet @xmath33 generates the masses of down - type quarks and charged leptons ; while in the l2hdm one higgs doublet @xmath33 couples only to leptons and the other doublet @xmath34 couples only to quarks . \n so the yukawa interactions of @xmath0 to fermions in these two models are given by @xcite @xmath50 with @xmath51 denoting generation index . \n obviously , in the type - ii 2hdm the @xmath52 coupling and the @xmath53 coupling can be simultaneously enhanced by @xmath54 , while in the l2hdm only the @xmath53 coupling is enhanced by @xmath55 . \n the structures of the nmssm and the nmssm are described by their superpotentials and corresponding soft - breaking terms , which are given by @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the superpotential of the mssm without the @xmath25 term , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are higgs doublet and singlet superfields with @xmath60 and @xmath61 being their scalar component respectively , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are soft breaking parameters , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are coefficients of the higgs self interactions .    with the superpotentials and the soft - breaking terms \n , one can get the higgs potentials of the nmssm and the nmssm respectively . like the 2hdm , \n the higgs bosons with same cp property will mix and the mass eigenstates are obtained by diagonalizing the corresponding mass matrices : @xmath70 where the fields on the right hands of the equations are component fields of @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath61 defined by @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75 are respectively the cp - even and cp - odd neutral higgs bosons , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are goldstone bosons eaten by @xmath1 and @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is the charged higgs boson . \n so both the nmssm and nmssm predict three cp - even higgs bosons , two cp - odd higgs bosons and one pair of charged higgs bosons . in general , the lighter cp - odd higgs @xmath0 in these model is the mixture of the singlet field @xmath80 and the doublet field combination , @xmath81 , i.e. @xmath82 and its couplings to down - type quarks are then proportional to @xmath83 . \n so for singlet dominated @xmath0 , @xmath84 is small and the couplings are suppressed . as a comparison \n , the interactions of @xmath0 with the squarks are given by@xcite @xmath85 i.e. the interaction does not vanish when @xmath86 approaches zero . just like the 2hdm where we use the vevs of the higgs fields as fundamental parameters , we choose @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath66 and @xmath89 as input parameters for the nmssm@xcite and @xmath68 , @xmath54 , @xmath88 , @xmath65 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 as input parameters for the nmssm@xcite . \n about the nmssm and the nmssm , three points should be noted . \n the first is for the two models , there is no explicit @xmath92term , and the effective @xmath25 parameter ( @xmath93 ) is generated when the scalar component of @xmath59 develops a vev . \n the second is , the nmssm is actually same as the nmssm with @xmath94@xcite , because the tadpole terms @xmath95 and its soft breaking term @xmath96 in the nmssm do not induce any interactions , except for the tree - level higgs boson masses and the minimization conditions . and \n the last is despite of the similarities , the nmssm has its own peculiarity , which comes from its neutralino sector . \n in the basis @xmath97 , its neutralino mass matrix is given by @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are @xmath101 and @xmath102 gaugino masses respectively , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . \n after diagonalizing this matrix one can get the mass eigenstate of the lightest neutralino @xmath107 with mass taking the following form @xcite @xmath108 this expression implies that @xmath107 must be lighter than about @xmath109 gev for @xmath110 ( from lower bound on chargnio mass ) and @xmath111 ( perturbativity bound ) . like the other supersymmetric models , @xmath107 as the lightest sparticle acts as the dark matter in the universe , but due to its singlino - dominated nature , it is difficult to annihilate sufficiently to get the correct density in the current universe . \n so the relic density of @xmath107 plays a crucial way in selecting the model parameters . \n for example , as shown in @xcite , for @xmath112 , there is no way to get the correct relic density , and for the other cases , @xmath107 mainly annihilates by exchanging @xmath1 boson for @xmath113 , or by exchanging a light cp - odd higgs boson @xmath0 with mass satisfying the relation @xmath114 for @xmath115 . for the annihilation , @xmath54 and @xmath25 \n are required to be less than 10 and @xmath116 respectively because through eq.([mass - exp ] ) a large @xmath87 or @xmath25 will suppress @xmath117 to make the annihilation more difficult . \n the properties of the lightest cp - odd higgs boson @xmath0 , such as its mass and couplings , are also limited tightly since @xmath0 plays an important role in @xmath107 annihilation . \n the phenomenology of the nmssm is also rather special , and this was discussed in detail in @xcite . \n in the type - ii 2hdm , l2hdm , nmssm and nmssm , the rare @xmath1-decays @xmath118 ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath3 and @xmath4 may proceed by the feynman diagrams shown in fig.[fig1 ] , fig.[fig2 ] and fig.[fig3 ] respectively . for these diagrams , the intermediate state @xmath119 represents all possible cp - even higgs bosons in the corresponding model , i.e. @xmath41 and @xmath42 in type - ii 2hdm and l2hdm and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath120 in nmssm and nmssm . in order to take into account the possible resonance effects of @xmath119 in fig.[fig1](c ) for @xmath2 and fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) for @xmath11 , we have calculated all the decay modes of @xmath119 and properly included the width effect in its propagator . as to the decay @xmath121 , two points should be noted . \n one is , unlike the decays @xmath6 and @xmath11 , this process proceeds only through loops mediated by quarks / leptons in the type - ii 2hdm and l2hdm , and additionally by sparticles in the nmssm and nmssm . \n so in most cases its rate should be much smaller than the other two . \n the other is due to cp - invariance , loops mediated by squarks / sleptons give no contribution to the decay@xcite . in actual calculation , this is reflected by the fact that the coupling coefficient of @xmath122 differs from that of @xmath123 by a minus sign ( see eq.([asqsq ] ) ) , and as a result , the squark - mediated contributions to @xmath121 are completely canceled out .    with regard to the rare decay @xmath11 , we have more explanations . in the lowest order , this decay proceeds by the diagram shown in fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) , and hence one may think that , as a rough estimate , it is enough to only consider the contributions from fig.[fig3](a ) . however , we note that in some cases of the type - ii 2hdm and l2hdm , due to the cancelation of the contributions from different @xmath119 in fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) and also due to the potentially largeness of @xmath124 couplings ( i.e. larger than the electroweak scale @xmath125 ) , the radiative correction from the higgs - mediated loops may dominate over the tree level contribution even when the tree level prediction of the rate , @xmath126 , exceeds @xmath20 . on the other hand \n , we find the contribution from quark / lepton - mediated loops can be safely neglected if @xmath127 in the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm . in the nmssm and the nmssm , besides the corrections from the higgs- and quark / lepton - mediated loops , loops involving sparticles such as squarks , charginos and neutralinos can also contribute to the decay . \n we numerically checked that the contributions from squarks and charginos can be safely neglected if @xmath127 . \n we also calculated part of potentially large neutralino correction ( note that there are totally about @xmath128 diagrams for such correction ! ) and found they can be neglected too . since considering all the radiative corrections \n will make our numerical calculation rather slow , we only include the most important correction , namely that from higgs - mediated loops , in presenting our results for the four models . \n one can intuitively understand the relative smallness of the sparticle contribution to @xmath11 as follows . \n first consider the squark contribution which is induced by the @xmath129 interaction ( @xmath130 denotes the squark in chirality state ) and the @xmath131 interaction through box diagrams . because the @xmath132 interaction conserves the chirality of the squarks while the @xmath133 interaction violates the chirality , to get non - zero contribution to @xmath11 from the squark loops , at least four chiral flippings are needed , with three of them provided by @xmath131 interaction and the rest provided by the left - right squark mixing . \n this means that , if one calculates the amplitude in the chirality basis with the mass insertion method , the amplitude is suppressed by the mixing factor @xmath134 with @xmath135 being the off diagonal element in squark mass matrix . \n next consider the chargino / neutralino contributions . since for a light @xmath0 , its doublet component , parameterized by @xmath84 in eq.([mixing ] ) , \n is usually small , the couplings of @xmath0 with the sparticles will never be tremendously large@xcite . \n so the chargino / neutralino contributions are not important too . in our calculation of the decays \n , we work in the mass eigenstates of sparticles instead of in the chirality basis . \n for the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm , we consider the following constraints @xcite :    * theoretical constraints on @xmath136 from perturbativity , unitarity and requirements that the scalar potential is finit at large field values and contains no flat directions @xcite , which imply that @xmath137 * the constraints from the lep search for neutral higgs bosons . we compute the signals from the higgs - strahlung production @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) with @xmath140 @xcite and from the associated production @xmath141 with @xmath142 @xcite , and compare them with the corresponding lep data which have been inputted into our code . \n we also consider the constraints from @xmath138 by looking for a peak of @xmath143 recoil mass distribution of @xmath1-boson @xcite and the constraint of @xmath144 mev when @xmath145 @xcite . \n + these constraints limit the quantities such as @xmath146 \\times br ( h_i \\to \\bar{b } b ) $ ] on the @xmath147 plane with the the subscript @xmath148 denoting the coupling coefficient of the @xmath149 interaction . \n they also impose a model - dependent lower bound on @xmath150 , e.g. , @xmath151 for the type - ii 2hdm ( from our scan results ) , @xmath152 for the l2hdm@xcite , and @xmath153 for the nmssm @xcite . \n these bounds are significantly lower than that of the sm , i.e. @xmath154 , partially because in new physics models , unconventional decay modes of @xmath155 such as @xmath156 are open up . as to the nmssm , another specific reason for allowing a significantly lighter cp - \n even higgs boson is that the boson may be singlet - dominated in this model . \n + with regard to the lightest cp - odd higgs boson @xmath0 , we checked that there is no lower bound on its mass so long as the @xmath157 interaction is weak or @xmath155 is sufficiently heavy . * the constraints from the lep search for a light higgs boson via the yukawa process @xmath158 with @xmath22 and @xmath61 denoting a scalar @xcite . \n these constraints can limit the @xmath159 coupling versus @xmath160 in new physics models . * the constraints from the cleo - iii limit on @xmath161 and the latest babar limits on @xmath162 . \n these constraints will put very tight constraints on the @xmath163 coupling for @xmath164 . in our analysis , we use the results of fig.8 in the second paper of @xcite to excluded the unfavored points . * the constraints from @xmath165 couplings . \n since the higgs sector can give sizable higher order corrections to @xmath165 couplings , we calculate them to one loop level and require the corrected @xmath165 couplings to lie within the @xmath166 range of their fitted value . \n the sm predictions for the couplings at @xmath1-pole are given by @xmath167 and @xmath168 @xcite , and the fitted values are given by @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively@xcite . \n we adopt the formula in @xcite to the 2hdm in our calculation . * the constraints from @xmath171 leptonic decay . \n we require the new physics correction to the branching ratio @xmath172 to be in the range of @xmath173 @xcite . \n we use the formula in @xcite in our calculation . + about the constraints ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , two points should be noted . \n one is all higgs bosons are involved in the constraints by entering the self energy of @xmath171 lepton , the @xmath174 vertex correction or the @xmath175 vertex correction , and also the box diagrams for @xmath176@xcite . \n since the yukawa couplings of the higgs bosons to @xmath171 lepton get enhanced by @xmath54 and so do the corrections , @xmath54 must be upper bounded for given spectrum of the higgs sector . generally speaking , the lighter @xmath0 is , the more tightly @xmath54 is limited@xcite . \n the other point is in the type - ii 2hdm , @xmath177 , b - physics observables as well as @xmath178 decays discussed above can constraint the model in a tighter way than the constraints ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) since the yukawa couplings of @xmath171 lepton and @xmath179 quark are simultaneously enhanced by @xmath54 . \n but for the l2hdm , because only the yukawa couplings of @xmath171 lepton get enhanced ( see eq.[yukawa ] ) , the constraints ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are more important in limiting @xmath54 . \n * indirect constraints from the precision electroweak observables such as @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , or their combinations @xmath183 @xcite . \n we require @xmath184 to be compatible with the lep / sld data at @xmath185 confidence level@xcite . \n we also require new physics prediction of @xmath186 is within the @xmath187 range of its experimental value . \n the latest results for @xmath188 are @xmath189 ( measured value ) and @xmath190 ( sm prediction ) for @xmath191 gev @xcite . in our code , we adopt the formula for these observables presented in @xcite to the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm respectively . \n + in calculating @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , we note that these observables get dominant contributions from the self energies of the gauge bosons @xmath1 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 . \n since there is no @xmath194 coupling or @xmath195 coupling , @xmath0 must be associated with the other higgs bosons to contribute to the self energies . \n so by the uv convergence of these quantities , one can infer that , for the case of a light @xmath0 and @xmath196 , these quantities depend on the spectrum of the higgs sector in a way like @xmath197 at leading order , which implies that a light @xmath0 can still survive the constraints from the precision electroweak observables given the splitting between @xmath150 and @xmath198 is moderate@xcite . * the constraints from b physics observables such as the branching ratios for @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 , and the mass differences @xmath202 and @xmath203 . \n we require their theoretical predications to agree with the corresponding experimental values at @xmath187 level . + in the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm , only the charged higgs boson contributes to these observables by loops , so one can expect that @xmath198 versus @xmath54 is to be limited . \n combined analysis of the limits in the type - ii 2hdm has been done by the ckmfitter group , and the lower bound of @xmath204 as a function of @xmath87 was given in fig.11 of @xcite . \n this analysis indicates that @xmath198 must be heavier than @xmath205 at @xmath185 c.l . \n regardless the value of @xmath54 . in this work \n , we use the results of fig.11 in @xcite to exclude the unfavored points . as for \n the l2hdm , b physics actually can not put any constraints@xcite because in this model the couplings of the charged higgs boson to quarks are proportional to @xmath206 and in the case of large @xmath54 which we are interested in , they are suppressed . in our analysis of the l2hdm , we impose the lep bound on @xmath198 , i.e. @xmath207@xcite . * the constraints from the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath208 . \n now both the theoretical prediction and the experimental measured value of @xmath208 have reached a remarkable precision , but a significant deviation still exists : @xmath209 @xcite . in the 2hdm , @xmath208 gets additional contributions from the one - loop diagrams induced by the higgs bosons and also from the two - loop barr - zee diagrams mediated by @xmath0 and @xmath155@xcite . \n if the higgs bosons are much heavier than @xmath25 lepton mass , the contributions from the barr - zee diagrams are more important , and to efficiently alleviate the discrepancy of @xmath208 , one needs a light @xmath0 along with its enhanced couplings to @xmath25 lepton and also to heavy fermions such as bottom quark and @xmath171 lepton to push up the effects of the barr - zee diagram@xcite . \n the cp - even higgs bosons are usually preferred to be heavy since their contributions to @xmath208 are negative . \n + in the type - ii 2hdm , because @xmath54 is tightly constrained by the process @xmath210 at the lep@xcite and the @xmath178 decay@xcite , the barr - zee diagram contribution is insufficient to enhance @xmath208 to @xmath187 range around its measured value@xcite . \n so in our analysis , we require the type - ii 2hdm to explain @xmath208 at @xmath211 level . \n while for the l2hdm , @xmath54 is less constrained compared with the type - ii 2hdm , and the barr - zee diagram involving the @xmath171-loop is capable to push up greatly the theoretical prediction of @xmath208@xcite . \n therefore , we require the l2hdm to explain the discrepancy at @xmath187 level . \n + unlike the other constraints discussed above , the @xmath208 constraint will put a two - sided bound on @xmath54 since on the one hand , it needs a large @xmath54 to enhance the barr - zee contribution , but on the other hand , too large @xmath54 will result in an unacceptable large @xmath208 . * \n since this paper concentrates on a light @xmath0 , the decay @xmath212 is open up with a possible large decay width . \n we require the width of any higgs boson to be smaller than its mass to avoid a too fat higgs boson@xcite . \n we checked that for the scenario characterized by @xmath213 , the coefficient of @xmath214 interaction is usually larger than the electroweak scale @xmath125 , and consequently a large decay width is resulted . \n for the nmssm and nmssm , the above constraints become more complicated because in these models , not only more higgs bosons are involved in , but also sparticles enter the constraints . \n so it is not easy to understand some of the constraints intuitively . \n take the process @xmath199 as an example . in the supersymmetric models , besides the charged higgs contribution , chargino loops , gluino loops as well as neutralino loops also contribute to the process@xcite , and depending on the susy parameters , any of these contributions may become dominated over or be canceled by other contributions . as a result , although the charged higgs affects the process in the same way as that in the type - ii 2hdm , charged higgs as light as @xmath215 is still allowed even for @xmath216@xcite .    since among the constraints \n , @xmath208 is rather peculiar in that it needs new physics to explain the discrepancy between @xmath217 and @xmath218 , we discuss more about its dependence on susy parameters . in the nmssm and the nmssm \n , @xmath208 receives contributions from higgs loops and neutralino / chargino loops . for the higgs contribution , it is quite similar to that of the type - ii 2hdm except that more higgs bosons are involved in@xcite . for the neutralino / chargino contribution , in the light bino limit ( i.e. \n @xmath219 ) , it can be approximated by@xcite @xmath220 for @xmath221 with @xmath222 being smuon mass . so combining the two contributions together \n , one can learn that a light @xmath0 along with large @xmath54 and/or light smuon with moderate @xmath87 are favored to dilute the discrepancy .    because more parameters are involved in the constraints on the supersymmetric models , we consider following additional constraints to further limit their parameters :    * direct bounds on sparticle masses from the lep1 , the lep2 and the tevatron experiments @xcite . * the lep1 bound on invisible z decay @xmath223 ; the lep2 bound on neutralino production @xmath224 and @xmath225@xcite . \n * dark matter constraints from the wmap relic density 0.0975 @xmath226 0.1213 @xcite . \n note that among the above constraints , the constraint ( 2 ) on higgs sector and the constraint ( c ) on neutralino sector are very important . this is because in the supersymmetric models , the sm - like higgs is upper bounded by about @xmath227 at tree level and by about @xmath228 at loop level , and that the relic density restricts the lsp annihilation cross section in a certain narrow range .    in our analysis of the nmssm , we calculate the constraints ( 3 ) and ( 5 - 7 ) by ourselves and utilize the code nmssmtools @xcite to implement the rest constraints . \n we also extend nmssmtools to the nmssm to implement the constraints . \n for the extension , the most difficult thing we faced is how to adapt the code micromegas@xcite to the nmssm case . \n we solve this problem by noting the following facts :    * as we mentioned before , the nmssm is actually same as the nmssm with the trilinear singlet term setting to zero . \n so we can utilize the model file of the nmssm as the input of the micromegas and set @xmath229 . * since in the nmssm , the lsp is too light to annihilate into higgs pairs , there is no need to reconstruct the effective higgs potential to calculate precisely the annihilation channel @xmath230 with @xmath61 denoting any of higgs bosons@xcite . \n we thank the authors of the nmssmtools for helpful discussion on this issue when we finish such extension@xcite . \n with the above constraints , we perform four independent random scans over the parameter space of the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm respectively . \n we vary the parameters in following ranges : @xmath231 for the type - ii 2hdm , @xmath232 for the l2hdm , @xmath233 for the nmssm , and @xmath234 for the nmssm .    in performing the scans , we note that for the nmssm and the nmssm , some constraints also rely on the gaugino masses and the soft breaking parameters in the squark sector and the slepton sector . \n since these parameters affect little on the properties of @xmath0 , we fix them to reduce the number of free parameters in our scan . for the squark sector \n , we adopt the @xmath235 scenario which assumes that the soft mass parameters for the third generation squarks are degenerate : @xmath236 800 gev , and that the trilinear couplings of the third generation squarks are also degenerate , @xmath237 with @xmath238 . for the slepton sector , we assume all the soft - breaking masses and trilinear parameters to be 100 gev . \n this setting is necessary for the nmssm since this model is difficult to explain the muon anomalous moment at @xmath239 level for heavy sleptons@xcite . \n finally , we assume the grand unification relation @xmath240 for the gaugino masses with @xmath241 being fine structure constants of the different gauge group .    with large number of random points in the scans , \n we finally get about @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @xmath242 samples for the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm respectively which survive the constraints and satisfy @xmath245 . analyzing the properties of the @xmath0 indicates that for most of the surviving points in the nmssm and the nmssm , its dominant component is the singlet field ( numerically speaking , @xmath246 ) so that its couplings to the sm fermions are suppressed@xcite . \n our analysis also indicates that the main decay products of @xmath0 are @xmath247 for the l2hdm@xcite , @xmath248 ( dominant ) and @xmath247 ( subdominant ) for the type - ii 2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm , and in some rare cases , neutralino pairs in the nmssm@xcite .    in fig.[fig4 ] \n , we project the surviving samples on the @xmath249 plane . \n this figure shows that the allowed range of @xmath54 is from @xmath250 to @xmath251 in the type - ii 2hdm , and from @xmath252 to @xmath253 in the l2hdm . \n just as we introduced before , the lower bounds of @xmath254 come from the fact that we require the models to explain the muon anomalous moment , while the upper bound is due to we have imposed the constraint from the lep process @xmath255 , which have limited the upper reach of the @xmath256 coupling for light @xmath61 @xcite(for the dependence of @xmath256 coupling on @xmath54 , see sec . \n this figure also indicates that for the nmssm and the nmssm , @xmath54 is upper bounded by @xmath257 . \n for the nmssm , this is because large @xmath87 can suppress the dark matter mass to make its annihilation difficult ( see @xcite and also sec . \n ii ) , but for the nmssm , this is because we choose a light slepton mass so that large @xmath54 can enhance @xmath208 too significantly to be experimentally unacceptable . \n we checked that for the slepton mass as heavy as @xmath258 , @xmath259 is still allowed for the nmssm .    in fig.[fig5 ] and fig.[fig6 ] , we show the branching ratios of @xmath260 and @xmath261 respectively . \n fig.[fig5 ] indicates , among the four models , the type - ii 2hdm predicts the largest ratio for @xmath260 with its value varying from @xmath262 to @xmath263 . \n the underlying reason is in the type - ii 2hdm , the @xmath264 coupling is enhanced by @xmath54 ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) , while in the other three model , the coupling is suppressed either by @xmath265 or by the singlet component of the @xmath0 . \n fig.[fig6 ] shows that the l2hdm predicts the largest rate for @xmath266 with its value reaching @xmath5 in optimum case , and for the other three models , the ratio of @xmath261 is at least about one order smaller than that of @xmath267 . \n this feature can be easily understood from the @xmath268 coupling introduced in sect . \n we emphasize that , if the nature prefers a light @xmath0 , @xmath260 and/or @xmath269 in the type - ii 2hdm and the l2hdm will be observable at the gigaz . then by the rates of the two decays \n , one can determine whether the type - ii 2hdm or the l2hdm is the right theory . \n on the other hand , if both decays are observed with small rates or fail to be observed , the singlet extensions of the mssm are favored .    in fig.[fig7 \n ] , we show the rate of @xmath3 as the function of @xmath270 . \n this figure indicates that the branching ratio of @xmath121 can reach @xmath271 , @xmath272 , @xmath273 and @xmath274 for the optimal cases of the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm respectively , which implies that the decay @xmath121 will never be observable at the gigaz if the studied model is chosen by nature . \n the reason for the smallness is , as we pointed out before , that the decay @xmath121 proceeds only at loop level .    comparing the optimum cases of the type - ii 2hdm , the nmssm and the nmssm shown in fig.5 - 7 \n , one may find that the relation @xmath275 holds for any of the decays . \n this is because the decays are all induced by the yukawa couplings with similar structure for the models . in the supersymmetric models , \n the large singlet component of the light @xmath0 is to suppress the yukawa couplings , and the @xmath0 in the nmssm has more singlet component than that in the nmssm . \n next we consider the decay @xmath11 , which , unlike the above decays , depends on the higgs self interactions . in fig.[fig8 ] we plot its rate as a function of @xmath270 and this figure indicates that the @xmath276 may be the largest among the ratios of the exotic @xmath1 decays , reaching @xmath277 in the optimum cases of the type - ii 2hdm , the l2hdm and the nmssm . \n the underlying reason is , in some cases , the intermediate state @xmath119 in fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) may be on - shell . \n in fact , we find this is one of the main differences between the nmssm and the nmssm , that is , in the nmssm , @xmath119 in fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) may be on - shell ( corresponds to the points with large @xmath278 ) while in the nmssm , this seems impossible . \n so we conclude that the decay @xmath11 may serve as an alternative channel to test new physics models , especially it may be used to distinguish the nmssm from the nmssm if the supersymmetry is found at the lhc and the @xmath11 is observed at the gigaz with large rate . \n before we end our discussion , we note that in the nmssm , the higgs boson @xmath0 may be lighter than @xmath279 without conflicting with low energy data from @xmath178 decays and the other observables ( see fig.[fig4]-[fig8 ] ) . in this case , @xmath0 is axion - like as pointed out in @xcite . \n we checked that , among the rare @xmath1 decays discussed in this paper , the largest branching ratio comes from @xmath280 which can reach @xmath281 . since in this case , the decay product of @xmath0 is highly collinear muon pair , detecting the decay @xmath280 may need some knowledge about detectors , which is beyond our discussion . \n in this paper , we studied the rare @xmath1-decays @xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath282 and @xmath4 in the type - ii 2hdm , lepton - specific 2hdm , nmssm and nmssm , which predict a light cp - odd higgs boson @xmath0 . in the parameter space allowed by current experiments , the branching ratio can be as large as @xmath5 for @xmath118 , @xmath8 for @xmath3 and @xmath9 for @xmath4 , which implies that the decays @xmath2 and @xmath283 may be accessible at the gigaz option . \n since different models predict different size of branching ratios , these decays can be used to distinguish different model through the measurement of these rare decays . \n this work was supported in part by hastit under grant no . \n 2009hastit004 , by the national natural science foundation of china ( nnsfc ) under grant nos . 10821504 , 10725526 , 10635030 , 10775039 , 11075045 and by the project of knowledge innovation program ( pkip ) of chinese academy of sciences under grant no . \n .        for some reviews , see , e.g. , m.  a.  perez , g.  tavares -

        "abstract": "This article explores the physics of the Z-boson within the context of proposed next-generation collider experiments, specifically focusing on a 'GigaZ' option at the International Linear Collider (ILC). The ILC is envisioned to operate at energies that resonate with the Z-boson, potentially increasing event generation significantly compared to past experiments such as LEP. This setup could allow for unprecedented precision in measuring Z-boson decays, particularly into fermion pairs, and offers the potential to explore exotic or rare decays which could indicate new physics. This paper discusses the theoretical motivations for these studies, the expected enhancements in decay measurement capabilities with high luminosity and polarized beams, and the implications for particle physics, emphasizing the exploration of new physics beyond the Standard Model."

        "article": "it is well known that the classical magnetoresistance ( mr ) in metals or semiconductors with a closed free electron fermi surface increases quadratically with increasing magnetic field @xmath2 for @xmath3 and saturates when @xmath4 . here \n @xmath5 is the zero - magnetic - field mobility . \n hence , the extraordinarily high and linear mr ( lmr ) , which breaks this familiar rule , has been gaining much attention as soon as its discovery . in the past decade \n , this unexpected lmr has been reported in silver chalcogenide,@xcite indium antimonide,@xcite silicon,@xcite mnas - gaas composite material,@xcite and graphene.@xcite    kapitza s linear law@xcite indicates that the metal shows a magnetoresistance linear in perpendicular magnetic field when it has an open fermi surface and a mean free path longer than the electronic larmor radius . \n recently , another two models , irrespective of the open fermi surface , have been constructed to provide possible mechanisms for the lmr phenomenon . \n abrikosov suggested a quantum - limit origin of lmr for the homogenous system with a gapless linear energy spectrum.@xcite his model requires that landau levels are well formed and the carrier concentration is small that all electrons occupy only the lowest landau band . \n alternatively , parish and littlewood developed a classical model without involving linear spectrum.@xcite ignoring the concrete microscopic mechanism , they attributed this unusual mr to the mobility fluctuations in a strongly inhomogenous system . \n topological insulators@xcite ( tis ) are novel materials with a full energy gap in bulk , while there are gapless surface states . due to its unique band structure with only one helical dirac cone and linear energy dispersion,@xcite the surface states of the ti bi@xmath0se@xmath1 become an excellent platform for the study of quantum - limit lmr . \n the recent experiment in this flat surface system , however , reported that a large positive mr , which becomes very linear above a characteristic field of @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 t , was observed even in an opposite situation where the carrier sheet density is high that electrons occupy more than one landau levels.@xcite moreover , they found that raising temperature to room temperature almost has no influence on the observed lmr . \n it is striking that this observation is in conflict with abrikosov s model and also with the classical parish - littlewood model . \n so far a reliable theoretical scheme capable of explaining this novel experiment has still been lacking .    in this paper \n , we generalize the balance - equation approach@xcite to a system modeling the surface states of a three - dimensional ti to investigate the two - dimensional magnetotransport in it . \n we find that a positive , nonsaturating and dominantly linear magnetoresistance can appear within quite wide magnetic - field range in the ti surface state having a positive and finite effective g - factor . \n this linear magnetoresistance shows up in the system of high carrier concentration and low mobility when electrons are in extended states and spread over many smeared landau levels , and persists up to room temperature , providing a possible mechanism for the recently observed linear magnetoresistance in topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 nanoribbons.@xcite \n we consider the surface state of a bi@xmath0se@xmath1-type large bulk gap ti in the @xmath9-@xmath10 plane under the influence of a uniform magnetic field @xmath11 applied along the @xmath12 direction.@xcite following the experimental observation,@xcite we assume that the fermi energy locates in the gap of the bulk band and above the dirac point , i.e. the surface carriers are electrons . \n further , the separations of the fermi energy from the bottom of bulk band and dirac point are much larger than the highest temperature ( @xmath13 ) considered in this work . \n hence , the contribution from the bulk band to the magnetotransport is negligible . \n these electrons , scattered by randomly distributed impurities and by phonons , are driven by a uniform in -

dependent average value of @xmath157 at higher portion of the magnetic field range , as seen in fig.[rhob](c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) for @xmath197 and @xmath198 . on the other hand , in the case of large mobility , e.g. @xmath199 , where the broadened landau - level widths @xmath200 are much smaller than the neighboring level interval even for level index @xmath120 as large as @xmath201 , the magnetoresistivity shows pronounced sdh oscillation and the linear -

saturating magnetoresistivity was observed.@xcite for the given electron surface density @xmath202 , the number of occupied landau levels , or the filling factor @xmath172 , at different magnetic fields is shown in fig.[rhob](f ) , as well as in the fig.[rhob](d ) and ( e ) , where the integer -

dependence of the linear magnetoresistivity . to compare with abrikosov s quantum magnetoresistance which suggests a @xmath207 behavior,@xcite \n we show the calculated @xmath208 for above lmr versus the carrier sheet density @xmath33 in fig.[rhon ] at fixed magnetic field @xmath209 t . \n the mobility is taken respectively to be @xmath210 and @xmath211m@xmath212/vs to make the resistivity in the lmr regime . \n a clearly linear dependence of @xmath213 on the surface density @xmath33 is seen in all cases , indicating that this non - saturating linear resistivity is almost inversely proportional to the carrier density . in the figure \n we also show @xmath208 versus @xmath33 under the condition of different given conductivity @xmath214 and @xmath215 . in this case \n the half - width @xmath216 is independent of surface density . \n the linear dependence still holds , indicating that this linear behavior is not sensitive to the modest @xmath33-dependence of landau level broadening @xmath216 as long as the system is in the overlapped landau level regime .    from the above discussion \n , it is obvious that lmr shows up in the system having overlapped landau levels and the separation of landau levels makes the mr departure from the linear increase . at high temperature , the thermal energy would smear the level separation and phonon scatterings further broaden landau levels . \n hence , it is believed that this lmr will be robust against raising temperature . \n this is indeed the case as seen in fig.[rhot ] , where we plot the calculated magnetoresistivity @xmath157 for the above system with zero - temperature linear mobility @xmath217m@xmath212/vs versus the magnetic field at different lattice temperatures . \n we can see that raising temperature to room temperature has little effect on the linearity of mr . \n due to the decreased mobility at higher temperature from phonon scattering , the weak sdh oscillation on the linear background tends to vanish . \n these features are in good agreement with the experimental report.@xcite \n in summary , we have studied the two - dimensional magnetotransport in the flat surface of a three - dimensional ti , which arises from the surface states with a wavevector - linear energy dispersion and a finite , positive zeeman splitting within the bulk energy gap . \n when the level broadening is comparable to or larger than the landau - level separation and the conduction electrons spread over many landau levels , a positive , dominantly linear and non - saturating magnetoresistance appears within a quite wide range of magnetic field and persists up to room temperature . \n this remarkable lmr provides a possible mechanism for the recently observed linear magnetoresistance in topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 nanoribbons.@xcite    in contrast to quantum hall effect which appears in the case of well formed landau levels and to abrikosov s quantum magnetotransport,@xcite which is limited to the extreme quantum limit that all electrons coalesce into the lowest landau level , the discussed lmr is a phenomena of pure classical two - dimensional magnetotransport in a system having linear - energy - dispersion , appearing in the regime of overlapped landau levels , irrespective of its showing up in relatively high magnetic field range . \n furthermore , the present scheme deals with spatially uniform case without invoking the mobility fluctuation in a strongly inhomogeneous system , which is required in the classical parish and littlewood model to produce a lmr.@xcite    the appearance of this significant positive - increasing linear magnetoresistance depends on the existence of a positive and sizable effective g - factor . if the zeeman energy splitting is quite small the resistivity @xmath157 would exhibit little change with changing magnetic field . in the case of a negative and sizable effective g - factor \n the magnetoresistivity would decrease linearly with increasing magnetic field . \n therefore , the behavior of the longitudinal resistivity versus magnetic field may provide a useful way for judging the direction and the size of the effective zeeman energy splitting in ti surface states . \n this work was supported by the national science foundation of china ( grant no . \n 11104002 ) , the national basic research program of china ( grant no . \n 2012cb927403 ) and by the program for science&technology innovation talents in universities of henan province ( grant no . \n 2012hastit029 ) .",
        "abstract": "This paper discusses the phenomenon of extraordinarily high and linear magnetoresistance (LMR) observed in various materials, such as silver chalcogenide and graphene, which deviates from the classical quadratic magnetoresistance behavior typically seen in metals and semiconductors with closed Fermi surfaces. The article reviews different theoretical models that attempt to explain LMR, including Kapitza's linear law for metals with open Fermi surfaces and Abrikosov's quantum model suggesting a gapless linear energy spectrum as well as the classical model by Parish and Littlewood, which attributes LMR to mobility fluctuations in an inhomogeneous system. The paper also explores the implications of LMR in topological insulators, particularly focusing on Bi2Se3, which exhibit unique surface states with linear energy dispersion. The study investigates the linear magnetoresistance in these materials using a balance-equation approach to model the two-dimensional magnetotransport in the surface states of topological insulators, presenting new insights into the potential mechanisms driving LMR in these novel materials."

called thermo - acoustic model @xcite , the energy deposition of particles traversing liquids leads to a local heating of the medium which can be regarded as instantaneous with respect to the hydrodynamic time scales . \n due to the temperature change the medium expands or contracts according to its bulk volume expansion coefficient @xmath5 . \n the accelerated motion of the heated medium generates an ultrasonic pulse whose temporal signature is bipolar and which propagates in the volume . \n coherent superposition of the elementary sound waves , produced over the cylindrical volume of the energy deposition , leads to a propagation within a flat disk - like volume in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the particle shower .    in this study , \n the hydrodynamic signal generation by two types of beams , interacting with a water target , was investigated : pulsed protons and a pulsed laser , mimicking the formation of a hadronic cascade from a neutrino interaction under laboratory conditions . \n with respect to the aforementioned experimental studies of the thermo - acoustic model , the work presented here can make use of previously unavailable advanced tools such as geant4  @xcite for the simulation of proton - induced hadronic showers in water . \n good agreement was found in the comparison of the measured signal properties with the simulation results , providing confidence to apply similar simulation methods in the context of acoustic detection of ultra - high energy neutrinos . a puzzling feature observed in previous studies \n a non - vanishing signal amplitude at a temperature of 4@xmath6c , where for water at its highest density no thermo - acoustic signal should be present  was investigated in detail . \n such a residual signal was also observed for the proton beam experiment described in this article , but not for the laser beam , indicating that the formation of this signal is related to the charge or the mass of the protons . \n in the following , the thermo - acoustic model @xcite is derived from basic assumptions , using a hydrodynamic approach . \n basis is the momentum conservation , i.e. , the euler equation @xmath7 for mass density @xmath8 , velocity vector field of the medium @xmath9   and momentum - density tensor @xmath10 including the pressure @xmath11  @xcite . equation ( [ eq_euler ] ) can be derived from momentum conservation . in the derivation , energy dissipation resulting from processes such as internal friction or heat transfer are neglected . \n motions described by the euler equation hence are adiabatic . \n taking the three partial derivatives of eq . \n ( [ eq_euler ] ) with respect to @xmath12 and using for the density the continuity equation @xmath13 a non - linear wave equation can be derived : @xmath14    to solve this equation , the problem is approached in two separated spatial regions : firstly , a region @xmath15 ( _ ` beam ' _ ) , where the energy is deposited in the beam interactions with the fluid and thus the wave excited in a non - equilibrium process ; and secondly , a hydrodynamic ( _ ` acoustic ' _ ) region @xmath16 , where the acoustic wave propagates through the medium and where linear hydrodynamics in local equilibrium can be assumed . \n this splitting can be reflected by the momentum density tensor , rewriting it as @xmath17 in local equilibrium the changes in mass density are given by @xmath18 with the bulk volume expansion coefficient @xmath19 , the energy deposition @xmath20 , the adiabatic speed of sound @xmath21 in the medium and the specific heat @xmath22 .    in the acoustic regime , where @xmath23 , the momentum density tensor can be expressed as @xmath24 ( using eqs.([eq_densitytensor ] ) and ( [ eq_density_change ] ) ) , where we assume an adiabatic density change with pressure . the non - linear kinetic term @xmath25 entering @xmath26 according to eq . \n ( [ eq_densitytensor ] ) can be neglected for small deviations @xmath27 from the static density @xmath28 and small pressure differences @xmath29 from the static pressure @xmath30 @xcite .    in the region \n b , where non - equilibrium deposition occur , one may make the _ ansatz _ @xmath31 with the direction @xmath32 of the beam which breaks the isotropy of the energy - momentum tensor and describes with the parameter @xmath33 in an effective way the momentum transfer on the fluid . \n although in non - equilibirum we apply eq . \n ( [ eq_density_change ] ) with the energy deposition density @xmath34 of the beam . \n then , with the additional energy - momentum tensor due to the beam @xmath35 the wave equation ( [ eq_wave_base ] ) reads @xmath36 the general solution for the wave equation can be written using a green function approach as @xmath37 \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the components of the unit vector @xmath38 and the retarded time @xmath39 . \n for the last conversion , partial integration and the total derivative @xmath40 have been used repeatedly . note that @xmath41 for @xmath42 , so that the integration is carried out over the volume of the energy deposition region @xmath15 . \n assuming an energy deposition without momentum transfer to the medium , the kinetic term in the _ ansatz _ ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) can be neglected ( @xmath43 ) yielding @xmath44 for a thermo - acoustic wave generated solely by heating of the medium . \n the signal amplitude @xmath45 can be shown to be proportional to the dimensionless quantity @xmath46 when solving eq . \n ( [ eq_pressure ] ) for the case of an instantaneous energy deposition .    equation  ( [ eq_pressure ] ) is equivalent to the results obtained from the approaches presented in @xcite . \n the derivation pursued above , however , uses a different approach starting with the euler equation and an anisotropic energy - momentum tensor , yielding a more general expression in eq . \n ( [ eq : pressure - approx ] ) . only if assuming an isotropic energy deposition one arrives at the expression for the pressure deviation @xmath45 given in eq . \n ( [ eq_pressure ] ) . \n note that the validation of the last assumption @xmath43 being a good approximation would require a detailed knowledge of the momentum transfer from the beam to the medium . \n taking it into account would result in an additional dipol term @xmath47 in eq . \n ( [ eq_pressure ] ) which may become the dominant contribution to wave generation if @xmath48 close to 4.0@xmath49c . \n however , for @xmath43 the pressure field resulting from a beam interaction in a medium is determined by the spatial and temporal distribution of the energy deposition density @xmath50 alone . \n the amplitude of the resulting acoustic wave is governed by the thermodynamic properties @xmath21 , @xmath51 and @xmath5 , the latter three depending primarily on the temperature of the medium . \n a controlled variation of these parameters in the conducted laboratory experiments and a study of the resulting pressure signals therefore allows for a precise test of the thermo - acoustic model . \n simulations based on the thermo - acoustic model , as performed to interpret the results of the experiments described in the next section , will be discussed in sec . \n [ sec_simulation ] . \n note that the energy deposition density @xmath50 and its temporal evolution for the proton and laser beam interactions discussed in this paper are quite different from those expected for the interaction of ultra - high energy neutrinos . \n however , if a simulation starting from basic principles allows for a good reproduction of the experimental results , it is reasonable to assume that these simulation methods are transferable to neutrino interactions , as they are governed by the same underlying physical processes . \n the experiments presented in this paper were performed with a pulsed infrared nd : yag laser facility ( @xmath52 ) located at the erlangen centre for astroparticle physics ( ecap ) of the university of erlangen , and the pulsed @xmath53 proton beam of the `` gustaf werner cyclotron '' at the `` theodor svedberg laboratory '' in uppsala , sweden . \n the beam properties allow for a compact experimental setup . in both cases , \n the beams were dumped into a dedicated @xmath54 water tank , where the acoustic field was measured with several position - adjustable acoustic sensors ( see fig . \n [ fig_test_setup ] ) . \n the sensors ( also called hydrophones ) could be positioned within the tank with absolute uncertainties below 1 cm . \n the temperature of the water could be varied between @xmath55 and @xmath56 with a precision of @xmath57 . \n the temperature was brought to a particular value by first cooling the water with ice ; subsequently the whole water volume was heated to the desired temperature in a controlled , gradual procedure . \n once the water temperature had been established , at least 10min remained for measurements until the water volume heated up by @xmath57 through heat transfer from the environment . \n this time span was sufficient for all measurements conducted at water temperatures below the ambient temperature . \n the explored range of spill energies for the proton beam was from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , the beam diameter was approximately @xmath60 and the spill time @xmath61 . for @xmath62 protons , the energy deposition in the water along the beam axis ( @xmath63-axis , beam entry into the water at @xmath64 ) is relatively uniform up to @xmath65 ending in the prominent bragg - peak at @xmath66 ( see fig . \n [ fig_energy_deposition_z ] ) . to adjust the spill energy , \n the number of protons per bunch was varied . \n the total charge of a bunch was calibrated with two independent methods ( faraday cups and scintillation counters ) , leading to an uncertainty on the order of 15% , with some higher values for low spill energies . to obtain the beam intensity and profile for the proton interactions in the water tank , the distance of about 1.2 m that the beam was travelling from the exit of the beam pipe through air and its entering into the water tank were included in the geant4 simulation .    for the laser experiment , the pulse energy was adjusted between @xmath67 and @xmath68 and calibrated using a commercial power meter . \n the beam had a diameter of approximately @xmath69 mm and the pulse length was fixed at @xmath70 . for the infrared light used , the laser energy density deposited along the beam axis has an exponential decrease with an absorption length of @xmath71 ( see fig .  [ fig_energy_deposition_z ] ) . \n for both beam types the lateral energy deposition profile was gaussian ( the aforementioned beam diameters are the @xmath72 s of the profiles ) . \n the two experiments allow to explore different spatial and temporal distributions of the energy deposition as well as two different mechanisms of energy transfer into the medium . for both beams \n , energy is deposited via excitation , in addition the medium is ionised in the case of the proton beam .     , width=294 ]    for the signal recording , sensors based on the piezo - electric effect @xcite were used . \n a full characterisation of these sensors had been performed prior to the experiments . \n they are linear in amplitude response , the frequency response is flat starting from a few khz up to the main resonance at @xmath73 with a sensitivity of @xmath74 ( @xmath40.02v / pa ) . \n the main resonance is more sensitive by @xmath45@xmath75 and sensitivity drops rapidly at higher frequencies ; at 90khz , the sensitivity has dropped by 20db . \n the absolute uncertainty in the determination of the sensitivity is at a level of 2db in the frequency range of interest . above 90khz \n the uncertainty exceeds 5db . to calculate the response of the sensors to an external pressure pulse \n a parametrised fit of an equivalent circuit model as described in @xcite was used . \n the sensitivity dependence on temperature was measured and the relative decrease was found to be less than @xmath76 ( or about 0.13db ) per @xmath77 .    for every set of fixed experimental parameters ( temperature , energy , sensor position , etc . ) \n the signals of 1000 beam pulses were recorded with a digital oscilloscope at a sampling rate in excess of @xmath78 . \n this rate is sufficient for the signals with spectral components up to 100khz , where the sensitivity of the sensors is negligibly small . \n these individual pulses were averaged to reduce background and environmental noise in the analysis , thereby obtaining a very high statistical precision . \n figure [ fig_signals ] shows typical signals measured in the proton and the laser experiment , respectively , using the same sensors and experimental setup . \n the general shapes of the two signals differ : a typical signal for the proton beam shows a bipolar signature , the one for the laser deviates from such a generic form . \n the laser signal has high frequency components up to several mhz due to the high energy deposition density at the point of beam entry and the almost instantaneous energy deposition compared to the @xmath79s pulse of the proton beam ; therefore the resonance of the sensor is excited causing a ringing in the measured signal . \n the spatial distribution of the energy density @xmath50 deposited by the laser leads to the two separate signals : the first originates in the beam area at the same @xmath63-region as the sensor placement ( _ ` direct signal ' _ ) , the second from the beam entry , a point of discontinuity where most of the energy is deposed ( _ ` beam entry signal ' _ ) . \n the signal of the proton beam is deteriorated with respect to an ideal bipolar signal . \n three main contributions to this distortion can be discerned : the recorded signal starts before the expected onset of the acoustic signal ( 55.2@xmath79s for the given position , see fig . \n [ fig_signals ] , given by the sonic path length ) ; reflections of the acoustic wave on the beam entry window overlay the original wave starting in the first rare - faction peak ; and finally there are frequency components of the signal exciting a resonant response of the sensor , slightly changing the signal shape and causing ringing . the first point was studied and found to be consistent with an electric charge effect in the sensors caused by the proton beam . \n its starting time was always coincident with the beam pulse entry into the water , even for sensor distances of up to 1 m , hinting at an electromagnetic origin of the distorting signal . \n the shape of this non - acoustic signal is consistent with the integrated time - profile of the beam pulse with a subsequent exponential decay . \n this deformation of the main signal is considered a systematic uncertainty on the signal properties and treated as such in the analysis . for the most part \n , its shape was fitted and subtracted from the signal .    in order to minimise the impact of the signal deformation caused by \n the described effects on the analysis of the recorded signals , robust characteristics were used : the peak - to - peak amplitude and the signal length from maximum to minimum of the signal . for the laser experiment \n these features were extracted for the direct signals only . \n = 10 cm and @xmath63=20 cm and are shown within the same time interval . \n the dash - dotted line in the upper graph indicates the charge effect described in the text . \n [ fig_signals ] , width=264 ] \n for an in - depth validation of the thermo - acoustic model , comparisons of the signal properties with simulation results based on the model are essential . to this end , a simulation of the expected signals was developed . \n it is based on the thermo - acoustic model using a numeric solution of eq . \n ( [ eq_pressure ] ) . \n the input parameters to the simulation were either measured at the experiments , i.e.  medium temperature and beam profiles , or simulated , i.e.  the energy deposition of the protons ( using geant4 ) . \n the thermodynamic parameters bulk volume expansion coefficient , heat capacity and speed of sound were derived from the measured water temperature using standard parametrisations . \n tap water quality was assumed . \n a series of simulations was conducted , where the input parameters were varied individually in the range given by the experiment , including uncertainties . \n especially the spatial and temporal beam profile have a substantial impact on amplitude , duration and shape of the signal . \n simulated signals and the respective sensor response corresponding to the measured signals of fig . \n [ fig_signals ] are shown in fig.[fig_signals_sim ] . to minimise systematic effects from the setup caused e.g.  by reflections on the surfaces \n , the sensor response was convoluted onto the simulated signals , rather than deconvoluted from the measured ones . \n thus in the analysis voltage rather than pressure signals are compared .    . \n the corresponding dashed - lined signals mark the simulated signals after convolution with the sensor response . for better comparability , \n the signal maxima were normalised to 1 . \n [ fig_signals_sim ] , width=264 ]    the shapes of the simulated pulses are altered by the sensor response , especially the high - frequency components above the resonant frequency of the sensor . in the case of the laser pulse , \n mostly the resonance of the sensor is excited , leading to a strong ringing . for the proton beam , \n the primarily bipolar shape is again prominent , whereas the laser pulse is segmented into the two parts described above . \n the direct pulse of the laser experiment exhibits a bipolar shape as well , albeit less symmetric than for the proton beam . \n figure [ fig_systematics ] exemplifies the dependency of the signal amplitude on the input parameters of the simulation : water temperature , pulse energy , beam profile in @xmath80 and @xmath81 , pulse length and the position of the sensor . as nominal positions of the sensor @xmath82 m , @xmath83 m , and @xmath84 m \n were used . \n all parameters were varied by @xmath85 around the value of the best agreement with measurement , i.e.  the values used for the simulations of the signals shown in fig . \n [ fig_signals_sim ] . \n some of the characteristics of thermo - acoustic sound generation are observable . as discussed in sec . \n [ sec_model ] , the dependence on temperature enters through the factor @xmath46 ( where the dependence on the speed of sound is negligible ) and is roughly linear in the range investigated for this study . \n the dependence on energy is strictly linear . \n the dependency on the beam pulse parameters is diverse . \n it is governed by the integral in eq.([eq_pressure ] ) and therefore depends on both the spatial and the temporal beam profiles and the interaction of the particles with the water . for a given point in space and time \n , the elementary waves produced in the volume of energy deposition may interfere constructively or destructively depending on the beam properties . \n accordingly , the length of the laser pulse has no influence on the amplitude , as with 9ns it is much shorter than the transit time of the acoustic signal through the energy deposition area . for the several ten @xmath79s long proton spill , the spill time is comparable to the transit time . \n thus the acoustic signal shows a strong dependence on the spill time . \n the dependence on the radial coordinate @xmath86 w.r.t . \n the beam axis @xmath86 follows roughly the expected 1/@xmath87 and @xmath88 fall - off of a cylindric source in the near and the far field , respectively . \n the @xmath81-position was varied between @xmath892 and 2 cm , as the signals were recorded within the @xmath90-plane . \n the resulting change in amplitude is below 1% . \n the @xmath63-dependency for the laser experiment follows the exponential fall - off expected from the light absorption . \n the one for the proton experiment shows the only non - strictly monotonic behaviour due to the form of the energy deposition with the prominent bragg peak .    using these dependencies the systematic uncertainties of the model \n were obtained using the experimental uncertainties of the various parameters . \n the main uncertainty for the proton beam is given by the temporal profile of the pulse , which was simplified to a gaussian profile for this chapter ( however not for the rest of this work ) . \n for the laser beam experiment this parameter influences the signal amplitude only on a one percent level . the second main influence on \n the amplitude is the sensor position along the beam axis ( @xmath63-direction ) . \n table [ tab_systematics ] gives the parameters and their uncertainties ( @xmath91 ) used for the simulation of the signals . \n the resulting systematic uncertainties in the amplitude ( @xmath92 ) are given as well . \n the combined uncertainties are @xmath93 for the proton signal and @xmath94 for the laser signal , respectively .    .beam \n parameters used for the simulated signals in fig . \n [ fig_signals_sim ] with their associated experimental uncertainties ( @xmath91 ) and resulting uncertainty in signal amplitude ( @xmath92 ) . \n the pulse length of the laser is set to a value much higher than in the experiment , to save calculation time . \n the resulting uncertainty in the signal amplitude is below @xmath95 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ] \n in the following , the results obtained in the comparison of experiment and simulation are presented . \n figure [ fig_proton_sim_meas ] shows a comparison between simulated and measured signals for the proton beam experiment at different sensor positions .    for better visibility only the main part of the signals ( first bipolar part ) \n is plotted . \n the input parameters of the simulation were varied within the experimental uncertainties until the best agreement with the measured signal in amplitude and duration was obtained for the reference point at @xmath80=0.40 m and @xmath63=0.11 m . for this optimisation , \n a simple procedure of adjusting the parameters manually and scanning the resulting agreement visually was found to be sufficient . \n the other signals were simulated with the same parameter set , only the sensor positions were changed . \n the signal shapes differ for different @xmath63-positions due to the geometry of the energy deposition profile described in sec . \n [ sec_setup ] with cylindric form in the @xmath96-plane and almost flat energy density in @xmath63-direction up to the bragg peak at @xmath63=0.22 m . due to this geometry an almost cylindrical wave \n is excited in the medium , with coherent emission perpendicular to the beam axis . in the region \n @xmath97 m the signals are of bipolar shape . along the beam axis \n ( @xmath98 m , @xmath99 m ) the main part of the observed signal originates from the bragg peak as a nearly spheric source and no clear bipolar shape evolves . \n the agreement between simulation and measurement is good for all positions . \n not only amplitude and duration match ( see also the following sections ) but also the signal shape is reproduced to a very high degree . \n the small discrepancies , primarily in the rare - faction part of the bipolar pulse , have contributions stemming from a non - ideal sensor calibration and reflections on the tank surfaces . \n however , a significant part of the discrepancies may lie in the beam pulse modelling or even the thermo - acoustic model itself . \n the prominent feature of the energy deposition of the laser beam is at the beam entry into the medium . \n overall , the geometry of this deposition is mainly a cylindric one with rotational symmetry around the @xmath63-axis , as for the proton beam , with coherent emission perpendicular to the beam axis ( direct signal ) . \n the signal from the discontinuity at the beam entry is emitted almost as from a point source ( beam entry signal ) . \n in contrast to the proton beam , the shapes of signals at different positions along the @xmath63-axis do not vary much , only the relative timing between the two signal components varies . therefore , fig . \n [ fig_laser_sim_meas ] shows only signals for a @xmath63-position in the middle of the water tank . here , both signal parts are well described by the simulation . \n the beam entry part of each signal is less well reproduced in the simulation due to its high frequency components where the sensor calibration is less well understood . \n +    m for different sensor positions along @xmath80 ( reference at @xmath100 m ) . for more details \n [ fig_laser_sim_meas ] , width=325 ]    to compare the characteristics of the signals in simulation and measurement in the following studies , their amplitudes and the point in time of the recording of the signal maximum were further studied . for the laser signal , \n the direct signal part is considered only . \n equation ( [ eq_pressure ] ) yields as velocity of propagation for the thermo - acoustic signal the speed of sound in the medium , here water . to verify the hydrodynamic origin of the measured \n signals the variation of the arrival times for different sensor positions perpendicular to the beam axis were analysed . \n figure [ fig_time_vs_distance ] shows the measured data and a linear fit for each beam type . \n the data is compatible with an acoustic sound propagation in water , as the fits yield a speed of sound compatible with pure water at the temperature used . for the proton beam @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) \n was obtained for a water temperature of @xmath103c , where literature @xcite gives for pure water at normal pressure @xmath104 which is in complete agreement . for the laser measurements the water temperature of @xmath105c and thus the speed of sound were significantly higher , \n the observed @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) is again in perfect agreement with the theoretical value of @xmath108 . \n the offset between proton and laser beam data in fig . \n [ fig_time_vs_distance ] is due to a differing delay time in between trigger time and arrival time of the different beams in the water and is irrelevant for the calculation of the speed of sound . \n position ) . \n the straight lines represent linear fits to the data points yielding @xmath109 and @xmath110 for the proton and laser beam , respectively . \n [ fig_time_vs_distance ] , width=325 ]      the durations of the complete , unclipped signals vary with sensor positions mainly due to reflections , which were not simulated and can therefore not be compared . \n the comparison of simulated and measured signals for different sensor positions within the water tank , excluding the parts of the signals dominated by reflections , was shown in fig . \n [ fig_proton_sim_meas ] . \n the good agreement between model and measurement also manifests itself in the development of the signal amplitude with distance of sensors from the beam axis , shown in fig . \n [ fig_amp_vs_x_protons ] . to minimise systematic effects from reflections , \n only the amplitude of the leading maximum is analysed . \n though there are sizeable deviations , the overall shape of the curve is reproduced . \n the behaviour is again different for the two @xmath63-positions . \n the development at @xmath111 m follows the one expected from a cylindric source with a @xmath112 behaviour in the near field up to @xmath4@xmath113 m and a @xmath88 behaviour in the far field beyond that distance . at the smallest measured distances , the simulated behaviour deviates from the measured one . \n presumably this is due to simplifications made in the derivation of the model in sec . \n [ sec_model ] . at @xmath114 \n m the amplitude falls off more uniformly , this is again a combination of the point -

[ fig_amp_vs_x_laser ] ) . \n this is again attributed to the high - frequent signal components of the laser , where minor uncertainties in the simulation may result in big changes of the signal amplitude . \n especially the overlap of the direct with the beam entry window signal distort the signal shape . at distances exceeding 0.5 \n m the two signal parts can not be distinguished .    ) for the laser beam experiment . \n points mark the measured amplitudes at @xmath116 m and the line the simulation result . \n [ fig_amp_vs_x_laser ] , width=325 ]      assuming otherwise unchanged settings , the energy deposition density @xmath50 scales linearly with total deposited energy . \n thus the spill energy can be written as a pre - factor in eq . \n ( [ eq_pressure ] ) effecting the pressure and thus signal amplitude linearly . as shown in fig . \n [ fig_amplitude_vs_energy ] this behaviour was observed in the experiments yielding a zero - crossing of the pulse energy at @xmath117mpa for the proton beam and @xmath118mpa for the laser beam . \n both values are consistent with zero . \n the slope of the line depends on the energy deposition and the sensor positioning along the beam axis and can therefore not be compared for the two beams . \n as expected from the model , the signal duration and signal shape showed no significant dependence on energy . \n m. there is a ten percent systematic uncertainty in the absolute determination of the pulse energy . \n the lines represent linear fits to the data points yielding a zero - crossing of the amplitude compatible with no energy in a pulse . \n the insert shows the data for the proton beam.[fig_amplitude_vs_energy ] , width=325 ]      the main feature of the thermo - acoustic model is its dependence on the temperature of the medium . \n figure  [ fig_temp_laser ] shows the temperature dependence of the signal peak - to - peak amplitude for the laser beam , where a positive ( negative ) sign denotes a leading positive ( negative ) peak of the signal . \n the two data sets shown in the figure were recorded by two sensors simultaneously , which were positioned at @xmath119 perpendicular to the beam axis and at @xmath120 and @xmath121 along the beam axis , respectively . in the case of the proton beam setup , which will be discussed below , these hydrophone positions correspond roughly to the @xmath63-position of the bragg - peak and a @xmath63-position half way between the bragg - peak and the beam entry into the water , respectively . for comparability , \n the same positions and the same sensors were chosen for the laser and proton beam experiments .     at @xmath122 . \n the insert shows a blow - up of the region around @xmath123c where the sign of the amplitude changes . \n [ fig_temp_laser],width=325 ]    the laser beam signal shown in fig . \n [ fig_temp_laser ] changes its polarity around @xmath124 , as expected from the thermo - acoustic model . \n the theoretical expectation for the signal amplitude , which is proportional to @xmath125 and vanishes at @xmath126 for the given temperature and pressure , is fitted to the experimental data . in the fit , an overall scaling factor and a shift in temperature ( for the experimental uncertainty in the temperature measurement ) were left free as fit parameters . \n the fit yielded a zero - crossing of the amplitude at @xmath127 , where the error is dominated by the systematic uncertainty in the temperature setting . \n c , fitted with the model expectation as described in the text . \n a systematic deviation from the model expectation as the amplitude changes its sign is clearly visible . \n the amplitudes were normalised to @xmath128 at @xmath122 . \n [ temp_amp_protons_uncorr ] , width=325 ]    . to allow for an easy comparison of the signal shapes , a point in time at the onset of the acoustic signals \n was chosen as zero time and for all signal amplitudes the corresponding offset was added or subtracted to yield a zero amplitude at that time . [ temp_comp_signals ] , width=325 ]    analysing the proton data in the same fashion resulted in a fit that deviated from the model expectation , and a zero - crossing significantly different from @xmath129 at @xmath130 , see fig . \n [ temp_amp_protons_uncorr ] . \n the data strongly indicate the presence of a systematic effect near the zero - crossing of the signal amplitude . to understand this effect , \n the signal shapes near the temperature of @xmath129 were investigated ( fig .

isotropic terms and momentum transfer to the medium in the momentum density tensor @xmath134 by setting @xmath43 in eq . \n ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) . as discussed in sec . \n [ sec_model ] , dipole radiation could contribute significantly near the disappearance of the volume expansion coefficient for the case @xmath135 . \n also other non - thermo - acoustic signal production mechanism have been discussed in the literature which could give rise to an almost temperature independent signal , see e.g.@xcite . \n the obvious difference to the laser experiment are the charges involved both from the protons themselves and the ionisation of the water which could lead to an interaction with the polar water molecules . \n another difference are the massive protons compared to massless photons . \n residual signals at @xmath133 were found in previous works as well @xcite , as will be discussed in more detail in sec . \n [ subsec : comparison ] .    for clarification \n further experiments are needed either with ionising neutral particles ( e.g.  synchrotron radiation ) or with charged particles ( e.g.  protons , @xmath136-particles ) with more sensors positioned around the bragg - peak . with such experiments it might be possible to distinguish between the effect of ionisation in the water and of net charge introduced by charged particles .      with the analysis that has been described above , the signal production according to the thermo - acoustic model could be unambiguously confirmed . \n while the model has been confirmed in previous experiments , the simulations presented in this work constitute a new level of precision . \n the most puzzling feature , a residual signal at 4@xmath6c that was also observed in previous experiments , was investigated with high precision by scanning the relevant temperature region in steps of @xmath137c . \n the observed shift of the zero - crossing of the amplitude towards values higher than 4@xmath6c , caused by a leading rarefaction non - thermal residual signal at 4@xmath6c , is in qualitative agreement with  @xcite . in @xcite , a residual signal at @xmath123c \n was also reported . since in that work \n the zero - crossing of the amplitude is observed at @xmath138c , i.e.a higher value than the expected @xmath123c , it can be assumed that the corresponding residual signal has a leading rarefaction .    in  @xcite \n , a residual signal is found at @xmath139c , however with a leading compression rather than rarefaction . \n the authors conclude that this may lead to a signal disappearance point _ below _ the expected value , in contrast to @xcite and the work presented in this article .    for the measurements with a laser beam reported in  @xcite , \n a residual signal was also observed at @xmath123c , albeit with a leading compression and a subsequent reduction of the temperature of the zero - crossing of the signal amplitude to about @xmath140c . \n this observation is in contrast to the laser experiment presented in this article .    in conclusion , \n the works of all authors discussed here indicate a non - thermal residual signal for proton beams , albeit with varying results concerning the size of the effect and the shape of the underlying non - thermal signal . \n the results for the laser beam reported in  @xcite differ from those described in the article at hands . \n it should be pointed out , however , that in @xcite and @xcite results are reported by the same authors for proton and for laser beams , respectively . \n a comparison of these two publications shows that a different behaviour near the temperature of @xmath123c was observed for the two types of beams . \n hence , to the best of our knowledge , there are currently no results in contradiction with the notion of different non - thermal effects in the interaction of proton vs.  laser beams with water . \n the available data does not allow for a more detailed analysis of the correlation between experimental conditions and the temperature of the zero - crossing of the signal amplitude . \n efforts to detect neutrinos at ultra - high energies are at the frontier of research in the field of astroparticle physics . \n neutrinos are the only viable messengers at ultra - high energies beyond the local universe , i.e.  distances well beyond several tens of megaparsecs . \n if successful , the investigation of these elusive particles will not only enhance the understanding of their own nature , but also provide important complementary information on the astrophysical phenomena and the environments that accelerate particles to such extreme energies .    for acoustic particle detection , not only \n the technical aspects such as optimal design and detector layout are subject of research . but \n also the underlying physics processes \n the formation of hadronic cascades resulting from neutrino interactions in dense media  have never been observed directly in detector experiments at these energies . \n producing ever more reliable extrapolation of reaction properties to ultra - high energies is an ongoing effort . with advancements in the simulations of cascades forming in water and improvements of detector simulation tools , the discrepancy between cascade parameters from independent simulations \n decreased : recent studies differ only slightly @xcite . \n at the same time it is necessary to gain a solid understanding of the sound signals generated from the energy depositions by particle cascades . for this purpose , \n laboratory measurements are required . \n this work , together with others @xcite has established the validity of the thermo - acoustic model with uncertainties at the @xmath141 level . \n the input to a model as discussed in this article is an energy deposition in water as it is also produced by a cascade that evolves from a neutrino interaction . in comparison with the uncertainty in the thermo - acoustic model , \n uncertainties due to the simulations of hadronic cascades and cascade - to - cascade variations are large @xcite , dominating the challenge to detect and identify sound signals resulting from neutrino interactions . \n it can hence be concluded that the current level of precision in modelling sound signals in the context of the thermo - acoustic model is fully sufficient for the understanding of acoustic neutrino signatures . \n the latter is necessary to improve the selection efficiency and background rejection for neutrino detection algorithms in potential future acoustic neutrino detectors . \n several experiments have been conducted  @xcite to understand the acoustic background at the sites of potential future large - scale acoustic neutrino telescopes in sea water , fresh water and ice . \n the combination of simulation efforts , laboratory measurements and studies with in - situ test arrays will allow for a conclusion of the feasibility of acoustic neutrino detection . \n we have demonstrated that the sound generation mechanism of intense pulsed beams is well described by the thermo - acoustic model . in \n almost all aspects investigated , the signal properties are consistent with the model . \n the biggest uncertainties of the experiments are on the 10@xmath0 level . \n one discrepancy is the non - vanishing signal at 4@xmath49c for the proton beam experiment , which can be described with an additional non - temperature dependent signal with a @xmath132 contribution to the amplitude at 15@xmath49c . \n the model allows for calculations of the characteristics of sound pulses generated in the interaction of high energy particles in water with the input of the energy deposition of the resulting cascade . a possible application of this technique would be the detection of neutrinos with energies @xmath142 \n this work was supported by the german ministry for education and research ( bmbf ) by grants 05cn2we1/2 , 05cn5we1/7 and 05a08we1 . \n parts of the measurements were performed at the `` theodor svedberg laboratory '' in uppsala , sweden . \n the authors wish to thank all involved personnel and especially the acoustics groups of desy zeuthen and of uppsala university for their support .",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive study on the generation of hydrodynamic (thermo-acoustic) signals by pulsed proton and laser beams in water, simulating the interaction processes of high-energy particles. Utilizing advanced simulation tools like Geant4, the study confirms the thermo-acoustic model through experimental measurements and highlights the differences in signal formation between proton and laser beams. The results indicate that proton beams produce a residual signal at lower temperatures, which may be influenced by the charge and mass of the protons. The study explores the implications of these findings for the detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos using acoustic methods in various dense media."

        "article": "the epoch of reionization signified the appearance of the first stars and galaxies within the first billion years after the big bang , and the transformation of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) from opaque to transparent . despite recent progress , however , it is not yet fully understood . \n it is now well established that reionization is completed by @xmath14 thanks to observations of the ly@xmath15 forest ( e.g. @xcite ) , and that the universe was substantially ionized around redshift @xmath4 when its age was less than 600 myr , based on the electron scattering optical depth measured by planck @xcite . \n however , there is still substantial uncertainty regarding the sources of reionization . \n can galaxies form with sufficient efficiency at such early times to provide enough reionizing photons ( e.g. @xcite ) , or is the process possibly driven by other classes of objects such as agn @xcite ? \n observationally , recent progress in near - ir detector technology has dramatically advanced our ability to search for galaxies during this epoch . following the installation of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , a continuously growing sample of galaxy candidates at @xmath16 is accumulating thanks to a variety of surveys . these range from small - area ultradeep observations such as the hubble ultra - deep field ( hudf , @xcite ) , to shallower , larger - area searches for @xmath17 galaxies either in legacy fields such as the cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels ; @xcite ) , or taking advantage of random - pointing opportunities like in the brightest of reionizing galaxies ( borg ) survey ( go 11700 , 12572 , 13767 ; pi trenti ) . overall , a sample approaching 1000 galaxy candidates at @xmath18 is known today @xcite , and we are beginning to identify the first galaxy candidates from the first 500 million years ( @xmath19 ; @xcite ) . \n these observations provide solid constraints on the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) out to @xmath4 , which appears to be overall well described by a  @xcite form , @xmath20 , as at lower redshift @xcite . however , other studies suggest that bright galaxy formation might not be suppressed as strongly at @xmath16 , and either a single power law @xcite or a double power law @xcite fit to the bright end of the lf has been explored . \n this change in the shape of the bright end is in turn connected theoretically to the physics of star formation in the most overdense and early forming environments where the brightest and rarest galaxies are expected to live @xcite . \n a departure from a schechter form could indicate a lower efficiency of feedback processes at early times , which in turn would imply an increase in the production of ionizing photons by galaxies . \n additionally , at @xmath21 , the observed number density of bright galaxies is affected by magnification bias @xcite , and this bias can cause the lf to take on a power - law shape at the bright end . \n currently , the samples at @xmath22 are still too small to draw any conclusion on which scenario is realized , since only a handful of @xmath23 candidates are known . \n in addition to constraining the shape of the lf , the brightest high-@xmath24 candidates identified by _ hst _ observations are also ideal targets for follow - up observations to infer stellar population properties such as ages and stellar masses @xcite , ionization state of the igm @xcite , and spectroscopic redshift . for the latter , confirmation of photometric candidates relies typically on detection of a lyman break in the galaxy continuum , ( e.g. , @xcite ) and/or of emission lines , primarily lyman-@xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite ) or other uv lines such as ciii ] or civ @xcite . \n spectroscopic follow - up for sources at @xmath25 is extremely challenging , with only limits on line emission resulting from most observations . \n yet , the brightest targets show significant promise of detection based on the latest series of follow - ups which led to spectroscopic confirmation out to @xmath26 @xcite , with several other ly@xmath15 detections at @xmath25 @xcite .    with the goal of complementing the discovery of the rarest and most luminous sources in the epoch of reionization from legacy fields such as candels , \n the brightest of reionizing galaxies survey ( borg , see @xcite ) has been carrying out pure - parallel , random pointing observations with wfc3 since 2010 . \n borg identified a large sample ( @xmath27 ) of @xmath4 @xmath28-band dropouts with @xmath17 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . \n this represents a catalog of galaxies that is not affected by large scale structure bias ( sample or `` cosmic '' variance ; see @xcite ) , which is especially severe for rare sources sitting in massive dark matter halos ( @xmath29 ) , as inferred from clustering measurements at @xmath18 @xcite . \n follow - up spectroscopy of the borg dropouts with keck and vlt has provided evidence for an increase of the igm neutrality at @xmath4 compared to @xmath30 @xcite . \n currently , a new campaign of observations is ongoing , with a revised filter - set optimized for the new frontier of redshift detection at @xmath23 ( borg[z9 - 10 ] ; go 13767 , pi trenti ) . \n initial results from @xmath31 of the dataset ( @xmath32 arcmin@xmath5 ) led to the identification of two candidates at @xmath3 @xcite with @xmath33 , which are similar in luminosity to the spectroscopically confirmed @xmath26 source reported by @xcite , but significantly brighter than the six @xmath34-dropouts with @xmath35 identified in the goods / candels fields from a comparable area @xcite . \n these recent developments indicate that it might be possible for a small number of ultra - bright sources ( @xmath36 ) to be present as early as 500 myr after the big bang . \n thus , they prompted us to systematically analyze the borg archival data from observations in the previous cycles , which cover @xmath37 arcmin@xmath5 , to search for bright @xmath3 candidates and constrain their number density . \n this paper presents the results of this search , and is organized as follows : section [ section2 ] briefly introduces the borg dataset . \n section [ section3 ] discusses our selection criteria for @xmath3 sources ( @xmath38-band dropouts ) , with results presented in section  [ section4 ] . in section [ lfsection ] \n , we determine the galaxy uv luminosity function at @xmath39 , and compare with previous determinations . \n section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes and concludes . throughout the paper we use the @xcite cosmology : @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 . \n all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system @xcite . \n we use data acquired as part of the brightest of reionizing galaxies ( borg[z8 ] ) survey , which consists of core borg pointings ( go 11700 , 12572 , 12905 ) , augmented by other pure parallel archival data ( go 11702 , pi yan , @xcite ) and cos gto coordinated parallel observations . \n for an in - depth description of the survey , we refer the reader to @xcite . here \n , we use the 2014 ( dr3 ) public release of the data , which consists of 71 independent pointings covering a total area of @xmath43350 arcmin@xmath5 . \n all fields were imaged using the wfc3/ir filters f098 m , f125w and f160w , and in the optical @xmath44 band , using either the wfc3 f606w or f600lp filter . we refer to the wfc3 f098 m , f125w and f160w images as the @xmath45 , @xmath38 and @xmath46 images , and to the f606w and f600lp images as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . \n exposure times in each filter vary on a field - by - field basis , and 5@xmath49 limiting magnitudes for point sources and aperture @xmath50 are between @xmath51 , with a typical value of @xmath52 @xcite . \n we note that since the dataset originates from parallel observations when the primary instrument is a spectrograph ( cos or stis ) , there is no dithering of the exposures . to compensate for the lack of dithering \n , the borg data reduction pipeline has been augmented with a customized laplacian edge filtering algorithm developed by @xcite . \n overall , the lack of dithering has a minimal impact ( @xmath53 ) on the image and photometric quality , as it has been established through comparison between primary ( dithered ) versus pure - parallel observations of the same field @xcite . \n since the borg[z8 ] survey was designed to have @xmath38 as primary detection band , some fields have only a single short exposure in the @xmath46-band . to ensure a consistently high image quality , here we include in the analysis only those fields with total exposure time @xmath54 in @xmath46 . \n this resulted in the exclusion of 9 fields out of 71 , so that the area included in our study is @xmath55 arcmin@xmath5 . \n the distribution of the exposure time in @xmath46 for the fields in borg[z8 ] is shown in figure  [ fieldhist ] . \n the borg[z8 ] public data release consists of reduced and aligned science images produced with ` multidrizzle ` @xcite with a pixel scale of @xmath56 , as well as associated weight maps ( see @xcite ) . following our standard analysis pipeline to search for dropouts in the data @xcite , we create rms maps from the weight maps , and normalize them to account for correlated noise induced by ` multidrizzle ` ( see @xcite ) . in short , this is done for each field and filter by measuring the noise in the image at random positions not associated with detected sources ( i.e. the `` sky '' noise ) , and comparing the measurement with the value inferred from the rms map , which can then be corrected by a multiplicative factor to match the measurement . \n our rescaling factors are on average @xmath57 for the ir filters and @xmath58 for @xmath44 ( see also @xcite ) . \n in addition , photometric zero - points are corrected to account for galactic reddening along each line of sight , according to @xcite . \n using ` sextractor ` @xcite in dual - image mode , we construct catalogues of sources in each field , using the @xmath46-band image for detection . \n colors and signal to noise ratios are defined based on isophotal fluxes / magnitudes ( flux_iso ) , while we adopt mag_auto for the total magnitude of each source . \n to select @xmath19 galaxy candidates , we use the dropout technique @xcite . at high @xmath24 , neutral hydrogen in the igm almost completely absorbs uv photons , leading to a break at the galaxy rest wavelength of ly@xmath15 ( 1216  ) . for galaxies between @xmath59 , \n this implies a drop in the @xmath38-filter , and non - detection in the @xmath44 and @xmath45 bands . \n our focus on @xmath38-dropouts implies that our sample of candidates are essentially detected only in @xmath46 . \n therefore , to minimize the risk of introducing spurious sources , we require a clear detection in @xmath46 , with s / n@xmath60 . \n we also impose a strong @xmath61 break , trading sample completeness for higher purity , and require a color cut : @xmath62 , which is more conservative than the typical @xmath63 applied to legacy fields ( e.g. @xcite ) since we do not have the availability of multi - observatory data to constrain the continuum of candidates at longer wavelengths and help control contamination . \n overall , we impose the following criteria for selection as @xmath38-dropouts : @xmath64    when computing the @xmath65 color , if the @xmath38-band flux has s / n @xmath66 we use the @xmath67 limit instead .    finally , to reduce the risk of contamination from detector defects surviving the data reduction pipeline , we further impose a stellarity cut through the ` sextractor ` class_star parameter . \n we require class_star @xmath68 , where 1 corresponds to a point source , and 0 to a diffuse light profile . \n we then visually inspected the dropouts that meet these criteria to reject any remaining detector artifacts and diffraction spikes . \n all the sources that meet all criteria and pass the visual inspection are listed in table [ table1 ] , and discussed below . \n lccccccccccc borg_0240 -

band ( @xmath38 and @xmath46 ) detections , the photometric redshifts are sharply peaked around @xmath9 . \n the photometric probability distributions are included in figure [ fig1 ] alongside the images of the candidates .    a comparison of the apparent @xmath46 magnitude against the photometric redshift of our candidates against @xmath21 candidates from other _ \n hst_/wfc3 surveys is shown in figure [ hvszplot ] . while two of our candidates are particularly bright in @xmath46 , they are consistent with previously - discovered candidates at @xmath39 by @xcite . \n we also determine the size of the candidates , starting from the observed half - light ( effective ) radius as determined by ` sextractor ` , which is translated into an intrinsic source size taking into account the effects of the point - spread function ( psf ) broadening and surface brightness limits following @xcite . \n the empirical relation has been constructed by inserting and recovering artificial sources with known input size and magnitude into borg images . \n source size is very helpful to help discriminate between high- and low-@xmath24 sources , since direct measurements by @xcite on candels galaxies show that @xmath95 sources are more compact than @xmath96 contaminants with similar colors . \n this empirical separation might be related to an approximate scaling of galaxy sizes as @xmath97 with @xmath98 @xcite , although a recent study by @xcite highlights that the intrinsic sizes likely evolve less strongly with redshift ( @xmath99 ) compared to observed sizes . \n we discuss the contamination of our sample further in section [ contamination ] . \n this candidate is the brightest in the sample , with magnitude @xmath100 . \n it is robustly detected in @xmath46 at @xmath101 , and marginally detected in @xmath38 at @xmath102 , even though it is close to the edge of the chip . \n the source has a very red @xmath103 color , with @xmath104 . \n it also shows extended structure , and has @xmath105 . \n its photometric redshift solution is sharply peaked at @xmath106 , with a broad higher - redshift wing . \n this candidate , in the same field as the previous one is detected with magnitude @xmath107 , making it the second - brightest source in the sample . \n it is detected with s / n @xmath108 in @xmath46 , and again marginally detected with s / n @xmath109 in @xmath38 . \n it is the most extended source in the sample , with @xmath110 . \n its photometric redshift , like borg_0240 - 1857_129 , is peaked at @xmath111 , with a broad higher - redshift wing . \n field borg_0240 - 1857 includes a third bright candidate with @xmath112 , detected at s / n @xmath113 . \n this source is not detected in the other bands ( @xmath38 , @xmath45 or @xmath44@xmath114 ) . \n unlike the two brighter candidates , this object is more compact , with a measured half - light radius @xmath115 . this is smaller than the psf of the image ( @xmath116 ) , indicating that it could be a point - source - like contaminant such as a cool dwarf star , \n although the stellarity of this source is @xmath117 , which is lower than the value expected for a point source ( e.g. @xcite uses class_star @xmath118 and @xcite class_star @xmath119 to exclude stars ) . \n this candidate is close to a foreground galaxy with @xmath120 , with a centre - to - centre projected separation of @xmath121 . \n while this foreground galaxy has an uncertain photometric redshift solution , it is likely to be at @xmath122 , based on its compact size . \n using the framework developed by @xcite and @xcite , we estimate the gravitational lensing of this source . \n magnification pdfs are obtained by estimating velocity dispersions from @xmath46 magnitudes , using the empirical redshift - dependent faber - jackson relations given in @xcite and @xcite . \n velocity dispersion is the best tracer of the strength of a strong gravitational lens @xcite . \n the einstein radii of the foreground objects are modelled as singular isothermal spheres ( e.g. @xcite ) which depend on the velocity dispersion and the angular diameter distance to the source , and between the lens and source ( where we use the best photo-@xmath24 values ) . assuming that the foreground source is at @xmath123 ( which maximizes lensing magnification ) , we infer a magnification @xmath124 . \n this object has a magnitude @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) , and is detected in the @xmath46 only , with an extended but compact structure ( effective radius @xmath127 ) . \n the source is located relatively close ( @xmath128 separation ) to a hot pixel , which appears in the @xmath45 and @xmath38 images . \n the @xmath46-band image is unaffected since it was acquired in a later orbit than the images in bluer bands . \n we carefully examined the individual flt files and conclude that since the separation between the source center and the hot pixel is larger than twice @xmath129 , and there is no sign of a hot pixel in the @xmath46-band , the identification of the candidate as a @xmath38-dropout is robust . \n this candidate is detected with a magnitude @xmath130 , and has s / n @xmath131 . \n it is not detected in @xmath38 , @xmath45 or @xmath44 . \n it has an effective radius of @xmath132 . \n this candidate is close to a foreground object ( @xmath133 centre - to - centre projected separation ) . \n the foreground object has an apparent magnitude @xmath134 , and is at an indeterminate photometric redshift . \n we use the same modelling framework as for borg_0240 - 1857_25 to estimate the lensing magnification of this source . \n assuming that the source is at @xmath123 , we find a maximum @xmath135 . \n analysis of the flt images of this field highlighted the presence of a bad pixel , correctly identified and masked by the data reduction pipeline , at the outer edge of the segmentation map of the dropout candidate in one of the two @xmath46 frames . \n to determine the impact on the final photometry , we measured the source flux in the flt frames separately , finding that the candidate is detected with s / n @xmath136 in the unaffected image and also s / n @xmath137 in the image affected by the bad pixel . \n hence , we are confident that the source is real and that the photometry from the final drizzled image is robust .      the sixth and final candidate is confidently detected at s / n@xmath138 in @xmath46 ( @xmath120 ) , and also in the @xmath38 with s / n = 3.7 . \n its photometric redshift is sharply peaked at @xmath139 , with a secondary solution at @xmath140 . \n this candidate is also very compact , with measured half - light radius @xmath141 , and the highest stellarity of the sample ( class_star = 0.91 ) . \n combining compactness with high stellarity from a high s / n source , a stellar nature ( cool dwarf ) for this source is relatively likely , as we discuss in section  [ contamination ] . \n to translate the results on the search of possible candidates at @xmath3 from the archival borg[z8 ] data into a number density / luminosity function determination , we need to assess both the impact of contamination in our sample , and the effective volume probed by the data . \n there are multiple classes of lower-@xmath24 sources that may have similar @xmath103 colors to @xmath19 lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) , such as galactic stars , intermediate - redshift passive galaxies , and strong line emitters . \n cool , red stars in the milky way may be possible contaminants of our sample , although typical colors lack a strong @xmath103 drop . at low signal - to - noise ratio , \n the separation of point - like galactic stars from resolved galaxies using the ` sextractor ` class_star parameter is not fully reliable . \n we use class_star @xmath143 in our selection of @xmath38-dropouts in section [ section3 ] to reject artifacts remaining from the reduction process , but this is not a strict enough criterion to reject all stars from our sample . in this case , five of our candidates identified as @xmath38-dropouts have class_star @xmath144 , with only borg_1459 + 7146_785 having class_star @xmath145 ( a value considered by @xcite as indicative of a stellar nature ) . \n therefore we conclude that this source is most likely a stellar contaminant with unusual colors . \n emission - line galaxies are another source of contamination for @xmath19 galaxy samples . \n for example , galaxies at @xmath146 with strong [ oii ] emission may appear bright in @xmath46-band while the galaxy continuum is too faint to be detected in the other bands @xcite . @xcite find that , at @xmath147 , the average density of extreme line emitters that enter the photometric selection is @xmath148 per arcmin@xmath149 , by creating mock catalogs of extreme emission line galaxies with varying @xmath38 magnitude and spectral slope @xmath150 . extrapolating this result to @xmath39 \n , we expect to find @xmath151 potential contaminants of this type over our survey area . \n this value is in line with previous spectroscopic observations of @xmath147 borg candidates by @xcite using the mosfire spectrograph on the keck telescope , and by @xcite using xshooter on the very large telescope . \n these studies found no emission lines in the spectroscopy of @xmath147 candidates , and are able to rule out emission lines from a low-@xmath24 extreme emission line contaminant to @xmath152 , assuming that all of the @xmath46 flux is due to a strong emission line . \n @xcite also find that , with a 3hr exposure , only a small part of the spectrum ( @xmath153 ) is so affected by atmospheric transmission and absorption by oh lines that a strong emission line would not be detected to @xmath13 . \n the last , and probably most severe class of contaminants , is that of passive and dusty galaxies that thus show a strong balmer break and a very faint uv continuum . under these conditions , \n @xmath154 sources may mimic properties of lbgs and thus enter into our selection . \n observations with _ \n spitzer_/irac at @xmath155 and @xmath156 m can efficiently distinguish between high- and low - redshift sources . \n in fact , dusty @xmath123 galaxies will appear 1 - 2 magnitudes brighter in [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] than in @xmath46 , while @xmath19 lbgs will have a relatively flat spectrum . without spitzer data , we rely on the size of the sources as proxy for the @xmath157 $ ] color , considering sources with @xmath158 as likely contaminants . \n @xcite find that , while the mean size of candidates in the @xmath39 sample from @xcite is @xmath72 , low - redshift , irac - red interlopers have a mean size of @xmath159 , but can be as small as @xmath160 , and there are no high-@xmath24 candidates with sizes greater than @xmath161 ( figure 4 , @xcite ) . \n hence , we take @xmath162 as a threshold . \n the two brightest sources in our sample are so extended to fall into such classification . \n the sources considered in @xcite are fainter than the @xmath39 candidates in our sample , and so it is conceivable that the larger sizes of borg_0240 - 1857_129 and borg_0240 - 1857_369 are due to their higher luminosities . using the size - luminosity relation derived in @xcite \n , we infer that the size of a @xmath163 galaxy at @xmath164 ( the brightest in our sample ) would be @xmath165 , below our threshold of @xmath162 . \n this size can not be used to completely reject extreme emission - line galaxies , which are likely to be more compact . \n for example , @xcite find that their sample of 52 extreme emission line galaxies in clash have fwhm @xmath166 , similar to our @xmath167 criterion for @xmath39 candidates . \n in addition to finding the redshift probability distribution of our six candidates using bpz , we also fit sed templates described in @xcite . from this \n , we find an average probability @xmath168 of @xmath169 . \n we conclude that three out of the six candidates , borg_1459 + 7146_785 , borg_0240 - 1857_129 , and borg_0240 - 1857_369 , are likely to be contaminants . \n for the remaining three , contamination is still a possibility , and hence we make a conservative assumption of @xmath170 contamination ( two out of three sources at @xmath171 ) , based on the estimate from the borg[z9 - 10 ] survey @xcite using the average probability @xmath168 for the candidates in their sample .      of the six possible candidates identified in the full borg[z8 ] survey , \n three of them , including the two brightest , are found in the same field ( borg_0240 - 1857 ) . \n the exposure time for this pointing is similar to the median of the survey ( @xmath172 s in @xmath46 ) , and thus such a catch is highly unlikely under the assumptions of a uniform distribution of candidates in the 62 fields analyzed here . \n based on theoretical expectations , the presence of clustering can be used to verify the identity of bright high-@xmath24 sources @xcite , under the broad assumption that uv luminosity is correlated with dark - matter halo mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n overdensities have also been identified at @xmath4 in lbg samples @xcite . \n however , one alternative possibility , more consistent with the relatively large size of the two bright @xmath34-dropouts , would be the presence of an overdensity of passive and dusty satellite galaxies within an intermediate redshift group . \n in either case , a further exploration of this configuration is very interesting since it can either identify an exciting overdensity of unexpectedly bright sources at @xmath11 , or shed light on the properties of intermediate redshift galaxies with extreme @xmath173 colors . \n we perform source recovery simulations to determine the efficiency and completeness of our selection , following @xcite . to do this \n , we insert and recover artificial galaxies with a srsic luminosity profile in the images . half of the sources follow a de vaucouleurs profile ( srsic index @xmath174 ) , and the other half follow an exponential profile ( srsic index @xmath175 ) , spanning a range of magnitudes ( @xmath176 ) , redshifts ( @xmath177 ) and sizes ( logarithmic distribution with mean 0175 at @xmath178 , scaling as @xmath179 ) . \n the spectra of the sources are modeled as power law @xmath180 with @xmath181 ( gaussian distribution ) with a sharp cut - off at rest - frame @xmath182 . \n the intrinsic profiles of the artificial sources are convolved with the wfc3 psf for each corresponding filter , before being inserted into the borg science images at random positions . \n sources are then identified with , and the statistics of the recovery rate is quantified . \n this is through the definition of @xmath183 which is the completeness of the source detection , that is the probability of recovering an artificial source of magnitude @xmath184 in the image , and of @xmath185 , which is the probability of identifying an artificial source of magnitude @xmath184 and redshift @xmath24 within the dropout sample , assuming that the source is detected . \n one example of the selection function for the dropout search in field borg_0440 - 5244 is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ figvolume ] , while the upper panel of the same figure shows the overall effective volume probed by our search over all borg archival fields as a function of the apparent @xmath46 magnitude . \n +   recovered from simulations , as a function of the apparent @xmath46 magnitude . \n bottom panel : an example of the selection function @xmath185 for field borg_0440 - 5244 . \n the selection function is derived from simulations , by inserting and recovering artificial sources . \n [ figvolume],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=46.0% ]      from the discussion in section  [ contamination ] , we consider the two brightest sources to be likely contaminants because of their large half - light radii , and we exclude the point - like source borg_1459 + 7146_785 as well . for the surviving three candidates we assume a contamination rate of @xmath170 , \n e.g. we expect two sources to be at @xmath3 . after taking into account the effective volume probed by our selection , our estimates for the bright - end of the luminosity function at @xmath3 \n is reported in table  [ table3 ] , and shown in figure  [ figlf ] . \n interestingly , we infer a higher number density of bright sources than previous determinations by @xcite around @xmath186 , although the uncertainty is very large because of the small number of candidates . for brighter sources ( @xmath187 ) , \n our upper limits on @xmath3 density are similar to those obtained in legacy fields , and strengthen the evidence for suppression of the abundance of galaxies at the bright - end of the luminosity function .    when compared to the initial results from the ongoing borg[z9 - 10 ] survey @xcite , assuming that our two brightest sources are low - redshift contaminants , we do not find evidence of ultra - bright ( @xmath188 ) galaxies despite analyzing data covering more than twice the area . \n if follow - up observations of our brightest sources indicate that they are likely at high redshift , we would instead determine that the lf is higher at the bright end than the upper limit from @xcite , and is instead consistent with the determination by @xcite at @xmath189 . \n overall , our lf determination is higher , but still consistent at @xmath190 with the theoretical model of @xcite , shown as grey shaded area in figure  [ figlf ] . \n previous studies did not attempt unconstrained fits to the @xmath3 lf , likely because of the small number of candidates . to evaluate the status of the situation with our additional datapoints , we attempt to derive schechter parameters for a maximum likelihood fit to the stepwise lf data , carried out assuming a poisson distribution for the number of galaxies expected in each bin ( see @xcite ) . due to the non - detection at @xmath191 by @xcite , \n the lf is suppressed at the faint end . \n this leads to a likelihood landscape that is very flat over a wide region of the parameter space , and hence , we are unable to sufficiently constrain the schechter parameters . \n our fit attempt thus highlights that the dataset is still too small for tight quantitative constraints , but future growth in the number of candidates identified will allow rapid improvements . \n finally , we note that our conclusions rest on the assumption that the two brightest candidates we identified in field borg_0240 - 1857 are contaminants . \n if we were to include them in the analysis as @xmath3 sources , we would infer that the lf would favor a power law at the bright end , rather than a schechter form . \n evidence for a single or double power - law form at high redshift has been seen in determinations of the lf at @xmath192 ( @xcite , also earlier considered by @xcite ) , and potentially at @xmath11 by @xcite , and may be naturally interpreted as a decrease in mass quenching from processes such as agn feedback at high redshift @xcite . \n magnification bias , however , can also produce this effect on an otherwise schechter - like lf . \n thus , the astrophysical interpretation of our search ultimately rests on follow - up observations to establish the nature of the candidates borg_0240 - 1857_129 and borg_0240 - 1857_369 . in any case \n , it is very interesting to note that the number of potential candidate @xmath34-dropouts that we identified is small ( just six in over 60 fields ) , making further observations time - efficient , especially because half of the sources are clustered in a single pointing . \n cc @xmath193 & @xmath194 + @xmath195 & @xmath196 + @xmath197 & @xmath198 \n in this paper we presented a search for @xmath19 candidates in archival data of the 2010 - 2014 brightest of reionizing galaxies ( borg[z8 ] ) survey , a pure - parallel optical and near - infrared survey using _ hst_/wfc3 . \n while the survey was optimized to identify @xmath4 sources as @xmath45-dropouts , we searched over the deepest 293 arcmin@xmath5 of the survey for @xmath38-dropout sources with @xmath199 , motivated by recent identification of very bright sources with @xmath200 . \n our key results are :    * we identify six @xmath39 galaxy candidates , detected in @xmath46 at s / n @xmath6 and satisfying a conservative @xmath65 color selection with non - detection in bluer bands of the survey . the candidate s magnitudes vary from @xmath201 to @xmath202 . \n analysis of the surface brightness profile leads to the tentative identification of three contaminants , with the two brightest sources likely being intermediate redshift passive galaxies due to their size , and one faint source a galactic cool dwarf star because of the compact size and high stellarity . \n * of the six candidates , three are in the same field , borg_0240 - 1857 , including the two brightest of the sample . \n such strong clustering would be naturally explained if the sources were @xmath3 ( see @xcite ) , despite contrary indication from @xmath129 , but an alternative explanation of sub - halo clustering at intermediate redshift would also be viable . * based on our best estimate of the lf , we infer a higher galaxy number density for sources at @xmath186 compared to the observations of bouwens et al . \n ( 2015a , b ) and with the theoretical model of mason et al . \n ( 2015b ) . \n however , our measurement is still consistent at the @xmath13 level with these studies . \n * irrespective of the nature of the two brightest sources in the sample , the selection criteria that we adopted yield a small number of candidates , very manageable for follow - up observations . \n this is quite remarkable , since the borg[z8 ] survey was not designed with @xmath11 in mind , and the number of contaminants could have been much larger given the absence of a second detection band and the lack of a near - uv color to help remove passive and dusty intermediate redshift galaxies . \n * targeted follow - up observations can efficiently clarify the nature of the candidates we identified , help to further constrain the bright - end of the lf and characterize the properties of the yet unstudied population of compact intermediate redshift passive galaxies that mimic the colors of @xmath203 sources . \n the efficiency of targeted follow - ups and the overall potential to complement searches for @xmath3 sources traditionally carried out in legacy fields are demonstrated by the very recent award of _ spitzer _ irac time to our team to investigate the nature of the sources discussed here ( pid # 12058 , pi bouwens ) . with these observations , it will be possible to clarify the behavior of the bright end of the lf at @xmath3 , as well as to confirm ideal targets for further spectroscopic follow - up investigations without having to wait for _ james webb space telescope_.    sb , mt , and jw thank the vatican observatory , where part of this work was carried out , for kind hospitality . \n this work was partially supported by grants _ \n hst_/go 13767 , 12905 , and 12572 . \n this research was conducted by the australian research council centre of excellence for all -

        "abstract": "This paper explores the epoch of reionization, a period less than 1 billion years after the Big Bang when the first stars and galaxies formed and the intergalactic medium transitioned from opaque to transparent. The study utilizes observations from the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3), alongside other deep field surveys, to collect a significant sample of galaxy candidates from this era. These observations contribute to understanding the galaxy luminosity function up to redshift @xmath4, providing insights into the sources responsible for reionization. The paper discusses the role of galaxies and possibly other astronomical objects like AGNs in contributing reionizing photons, using both direct observations and theoretical models to analyze the star formation in early galaxies and their role in the broader cosmic evolution."

        "article": "invariants are a popular concept in object recognition and image retrieval  @xcite . \n they aim to provide descriptions that remain constant under certain geometric or radiometric transformations of the scene , thereby reducing the search space . \n they can be classified into global invariants , typically based either on a set of key points or on moments , and local invariants , typically based on derivatives of the image function which is assumed to be continuous and differentiable . \n the geometric transformations of interest often include translation , rotation , and scaling , summarily referred to as _ similarity _ transformations . in a previous paper  @xcite , building on work done by schmid and mohr  @xcite , we have proposed differential invariants for those similarity transformations , plus _ linear _ brightness change . here \n , we are looking at a _ non -

linear quantization also precompensates for the non - linear mapping from voltage to brightness in electronic display devices  @xcite . \n gamma correction can be expressed by the equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the input intensity , @xmath2 is the output intensity , and @xmath3 is a normalization factor which is determined by the value of @xmath4 . for output devices , the ntsc standard specifies @xmath5 . for input devices like cameras , \n the parameter value is just inversed , resulting in a typical value of @xmath6 . \n the camera we used , the sony 3 ccd color camera dxc  950 , exhibited @xmath7 . for the kodak megaplus xrc camera ] \n [ fig : gammacorr ] shows the intensity mapping of 8-bit data for different values of @xmath4 . \n it turns out that an invariant under gamma correction can be designed from first and second order derivatives . \n additional invariance under scaling requires third order derivatives . \n derivatives are by nature translationally invariant . \n rotational invariance in 2-d is achieved by using rotationally symmetric operators . \n the key idea for the design of the proposed invariants is to form suitable ratios of the derivatives of the image function such that the parameters describing the transformation of interest will cancel out . \n this idea has been used in  @xcite to achieve invariance under linear brightness changes , and it can be adjusted to the context of gamma correction by  at least conceptually  considering the _ logarithm _ of the image function . for simplicity , we begin with 1-d image functions . \n let @xmath8 be the image function , i.e.  the original signal , assumed to be continuous and differentiable , and @xmath9 the corresponding gamma corrected function . \n note that @xmath8 is a special case of @xmath10 where @xmath11 . \n taking the logarithm yields @xmath12 with the derivatives @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . \n we can now define the invariant @xmath15 under gamma correction to be @xmath16{0mm}{13 mm }          & = $ \\frac{\\gamma\\ , \\frac{f'(x)}{f(x ) } }                  { \\gamma\\ , \\frac{f(x)\\,f''(x ) -

{ f'}^2}$            & { \\normalsize if $ |f\\,f'| < |f\\,f '' - { f'}^2|$ } \\\\         & $ \\frac{f\\,f '' - { f'}^2}{f\\,f'}$            & { \\normalsize else } \\\\ \n \\end{tabular}\\ ] ] where , for notational convenience , we have dropped the variable @xmath18 . \n the modification entails . \n note that the modification is just a heuristic to deal with poles . \n if all derivatives are zero because the image function is constant , then differentials are certainly not the best way to represent the function . \n if scaling is a transformation that has to be considered , then another parameter @xmath20 describing the change of size has to be introduced . \n that is , scaling is modeled here as variable substitution  @xcite : the scaled version of @xmath8 is @xmath21 . \n so we are looking at the function @xmath22 where the derivatives with respect to @xmath18 are @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . now \n the invariant @xmath26 is obtained by defining a suitable ratio of the derivatives such that both @xmath4 and @xmath20 cancel out : @xmath27{0mm}{10 mm }          & = $ \\frac{g^2 g'\\,g ' '' -

3\\,g\\,{g'}^2 g '' + 2\\,{g'}^4 }                { g^2 { g''}^2   - 2\\,g\\,{g'}^2 g '' +   \\ { g'}^4}$            & { \\normalsize if cond2 } \\\\         & $ \\frac{g^2 { g''}^2   - 2\\,g\\,{g'}^2 g '' +   \\ { g'}^4 }                { g^2 g'\\,g ' '' - 3\\,g\\,{g'}^2 g '' + 2\\,{g'}^4}$            & { \\normalsize else } \\\\ \n \\end{tabular}\\ ] ] where condition cond1 is @xmath29 @xmath30 , and condition cond2 is @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 . \n again , this modification entails . \n it is a straightforward albeit cumbersome exercise to verify the invariants from eqs . \n ( [ eq : th12 g ] ) and  ( [ eq : th123 g ] ) with an analytical , differentiable function . as an arbitrary example \n , we choose @xmath34 the first three derivatives are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . \n then , according to eq . \n ( [ eq : th12 g ] ) , @xmath38 . \n if we now replace @xmath8 with a gamma corrected version , say @xmath39 , the first derivative becomes @xmath40 , the second derivative is @xmath41 , and the third is @xmath42 . if we plug these derivatives into eq . \n ( [ eq : th12 g ] ) , we obtain an expression for @xmath43 which is identical to the one for @xmath17 above . \n the algebraically inclined reader is encouraged to verify the invariant @xmath44 for the same function . \n [ fig : analyex ] shows the example function and its gamma corrected counterpart , together with their derivatives and the two modified invariants . \n as expected , the graphs of the invariants are the same on the right as on the left . \n note that the invariants define a many - to - one mapping . \n that is , the mapping is not information preserving , and it is not possible to reconstruct the original image from its invariant representation . \n if @xmath45 or @xmath46 are to be computed on images , then eqs .  ( [ eq : th12 g ] ) to  ( [ eq : thm123 g ] ) have to be generalized to two dimensions . \n this is to be done in a rotationally invariant way in order to achieve invariance under similarity transformations . \n the standard way is to use rotationally symmetric operators . \n for the first derivative , we have the well known _ \n gradient magnitude _ , defined as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the 2-d image function , and @xmath49 , @xmath50 are partial derivatives along the x - axis and the y - axis . for the second order derivative \n , we can use the linear _ laplacian _ \n @xmath51 horn  @xcite also presents an alternative second order derivative operator , the _ \n quadratic variation _ \n @xmath52 since the qv is not a linear operator and more expensive to compute , we use the laplacian for our implementation . for the third order derivative , \n we can define , in close analogy with the quadratic variation , a _ \n cubic variation _ as @xmath53    the invariants from eqs . \n ( [ eq : th12 g ] ) to  ( [ eq : thm123 g ] ) remain valid in 2-d if we replace @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 with @xmath57 , and @xmath58 with @xmath59 . \n this can be verified by going through the same argument as for the functions . \n recall that the critical observation in eq . \n ( [ eq : th12 g ] ) was that @xmath4 cancels out , which is the case when all derivatives return a factor @xmath4 . \n but such is also the case with the rotationally symmetric operators mentioned above . \n for example , if we apply the gradient magnitude operator to @xmath60 , i.e.  to the logarithm of a gamma corrected image function , we obtain @xmath61 returning a factor @xmath4 , and analogously for @xmath62 , qv , and cv . \n a similar argument holds for eq . \n ( [ eq : th123 g ] ) where we have to show , in addition , that the first derivative returns a factor @xmath20 , the second derivative returns a factor @xmath63 , and the third derivative returns a factor @xmath64 , which is the case for our 2-d operators .      while the derivatives of continuous , differentiable functions are uniquely defined , there are many ways to implement derivatives for _ sampled _ functions . \n we follow schmid and mohr  @xcite , ter haar romeny  @xcite , and many other researchers in employing the derivatives of the gaussian function as filters to compute the derivatives of a sampled image function via convolution . \n this way , derivation is combined with smoothing . \n the 2-d zero mean gaussian is defined as @xmath65 the partial derivatives up to third order are @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 . \n they are shown in fig . \n [ fig : gausskernels ] . we used the parameter setting @xmath75 and kernel size @xmath76 \n with these kernels , eq . \n ( [ eq : th12 g ] ) , for example , is implemented as @xmath77 at each pixel @xmath78 , where @xmath79 denotes convolution . \n we evaluate the invariant @xmath45 from eq . \n ( [ eq : thm12 g ] ) in two different ways . \n first , we measure how much the invariant computed on an image without gamma correction is different from the invariant computed on the same image but with gamma correction . \n theoretical , this difference should be zero , but in practice , it is not . \n second , we compare template matching accuracy on intensity images , again without and with gamma correction , to the accuracy achievable if instead the invariant representation is used . \n we also examine whether the results can be improved by prefiltering . \n a straightforward error measure is the _ absolute error _ , @xmath80 where `` 0gc '' refers to the image without gamma correction , and gc stands for either `` sgc '' if the gamma correction is done synthetically via eq . \n ( [ eq : gammacorr ] ) , or for `` cgc '' if the gamma correction is done via the camera hardware . like the invariant itself , \n the absolute error is computed at each pixel location @xmath81 of the image , except for the image boundaries where the derivatives and therefore the invariants can not be computed reliably . \n [ fig : imas ] shows an example image . \n the sgc image has been computed from the 0gc image , with @xmath82 . \n note that the gamma correction is done _ \n after _ the quantization of the 0gc image , since we do nt have access to the 0gc image before quantization . \n [ fig : accuinv ] shows the invariant representations of the image data from fig . \n [ fig : imas ] and the corresponding absolute errors . since , we have . \n the dark points in fig .  [ fig : accuinv ] , ( c ) and  ( e ) , indicate areas of large errors . \n we observe two error sources :    * the invariant can not be computed robustly in homogeneous regions . \n this is hardly surprising , given that it is based on differentials which are by definition only sensitive to spatial changes of the signal . \n * there are outliers even in the sgc invariant representation , at points of very high contrast edges . \n they are a byproduct of the inherent smoothing when the derivatives are computed with differentials of the gaussian . \n note that the latter put a ceiling on the maximum gradient magnitude that is computable on 8-bit images . \n in addition to computing the absolute error , we can also compute the relative error , in percent , as @xmath83 then we can define the set @xmath84 of _ reliable points _ , relative to some error threshold  @xmath85 , as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , the percentage of reliable points , as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the number of valid , i.e.  non - boundary , pixels in the image . \n [ fig : reliapts ] shows , in the first row , the reliable points for three different values of the threshold @xmath85 . \n the second row shows the sets of reliable points for the same thresholds if we gently prefilter the 0gc and cgc images . the corresponding data for the ten test images from fig . \n [ fig : imadb ] is summarized in table  [ tab : reliaperc ] . \n derivatives are known to be sensitive to noise . \n noise can be reduced by smoothing the original data before the invariants are computed . on the other hand , derivatives should be computed as locally as possible . with these conflicting goals to be considered , we experiment with gentle prefiltering , using a gaussian filter of size @xmath90=1.0 . \n the size of the gaussian to compute the invariant @xmath45 is set to @xmath91=1.0 . \n note that @xmath90 and @xmath91 can _ not _ be combined into just one gaussian because of the non - linearity of the invariant . \n with respect to the set of reliable points , we observe that after prefiltering , roughly half the points , on average , have a relative error of less than 20% . \n gentle prefiltering consistently reduces both absolute and relative errors , but strong prefiltering does not . \n template matching is a frequently employed technique in computer vision . here \n , we will examine how gamma correction affects the spatial accuracy of template matching , and whether that accuracy can be improved by using the invariant @xmath45 . \n an overview of the testbed scenario is given in fig . \n [ fig : templloca ] . a  small template of size @xmath92 , representing the search pattern , \n is taken from a 0gc intensity image , i.e.  without gamma correction . \n this query template is then correlated with the corresponding cgc intensity image , i.e.  the same scene but with gamma correction switched on . \n if the correlation maximum occurs at exactly the location where the 0gc query template has been cut out , we call this a _ correct maximum correlation position _ , or cmcp \n .    the correlation function @xmath93 employed here is based on a normalized mean squared difference @xmath94  @xcite : @xmath95 where @xmath1 is an image , @xmath96 is a template positioned at @xmath78 , @xmath97 is the mean of the subimage of @xmath1 at @xmath78 of the same size as @xmath96 , @xmath98 is the mean of the template , and @xmath99 . \n the template location problem then is to perform this correlation for the whole image and to determine whether the position of the correlation maximum occurs precisely at @xmath78 . \n [ fig : matchtempl ] demonstrates the template location problem , on the left for an intensity image , and on the right for its invariant representation . \n the black box marks the position of the original template at ( 40,15 ) , and the white box marks the position of the matched template , which is incorrectly located at ( 50,64 ) in the intensity image . on the right , the matched template ( white ) \n has overwritten the original template ( black ) at the same , correctly identified position . \n [ fig : correlexmpl ] visualizes the correlation function over the whole image . \n the white areas are regions of high correlation . \n the example from figs . \n [ fig : matchtempl ] and  [ fig : correlexmpl ] deals with only _ one _ arbitrarily selected template . in order to systematically analyze the template location problem , we repeat the correlation process for all possible template locations \n . then we can define the _ correlation accuracy _ ca as the percentage of correctly located templates , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the size of the template , @xmath102 is the set of correct maximum correlation positions , and @xmath89 , again , is the number of valid pixels . \n we compute the correlation accuracy both for unfiltered images and for gently prefiltered images , with @xmath103 . \n [ fig : corrcorrelpts ] shows the binary correlation accuracy matrices for our example image . \n the cmcp set is shown in white , its complement and the boundaries in black . \n we observe a higher correlation accuracy for the invariant representation , which is improved by the prefiltering . \n we have computed the correlation accuracy for all the images given in fig . \n [ fig : imadb ] . \n the results are shown in table  [ tab : ca ] and visualized in fig . \n [ fig : correlaccuras ] . \n we observe the following :    * the correlation accuracy ca is higher on the invariant representation than on the intensity images . \n * the correlation accuracy is higher on the invariant representation with gentle prefiltering , @xmath103 , than without prefiltering . \n we also observed a decrease in correlation accuracy if we increase the prefiltering well beyond @xmath103 . \n by contrast , prefiltering seems to be always detrimental to the intensity images ca . \n * the correlation accuracy shows a wide variation , roughly in the range 30%@xmath10490% for the unfiltered intensity images and 50%@xmath104100% for prefiltered invariant representations . \n similarly , the gain in correlation accuracy ranges from close to zero up to 45% . for our test images \n , it turns out that the invariant representation is always superior , but that does nt necessarily have to be the case . * the medians and means of the cas over all test images confirm the gain in correlation accuracy for the invariant representation . * the larger the template size , the higher the correlation accuracy , independent of the representation . \n a larger template size means more structure , and more discriminatory power . \n we have proposed novel invariants that combine invariance under gamma correction with invariance under geometric transformations . in a general sense , \n the invariants can be seen as trading off derivatives for a power law parameter , which makes them interesting for applications beyond image processing . \n the error analysis of our implementation on real images has shown that , for sampled data , the invariants can not be computed robustly everywhere . \n nevertheless , the template matching application scenario has demonstrated that a performance gain is achievable by using the proposed invariant . \n bob woodham suggested to the author to look into invariance under gamma correction . \n his meticulous comments on this work were much appreciated . \n jochen lang helped with the acquisition of image data through the acme facility  @xcite . \n d.  forsyth , j.  mundy ,

        "abstract": "This article delves into the development and application of image invariants, focusing particularly on invariants under non-linear gamma correction transformations in image processing. These transformations are commonly used in cameras and display devices to adjust the brightness of images to align with human perceptual abilities. The paper introduces a mathematical framework for creating invariants that remain consistent despite gamma correction, scaling, rotation, and translation of images. This is achieved through differential invariants that leverage derivatives of the image function, which naturally exclude the effects of the mentioned transformations. The study extends the previous work on linear brightness changes and adapts it to address non-linear adjustments, providing a robust method for object recognition and image retrieval in varied lighting conditions and orientations."

        "article": "it is believed that solar magnetic fields are created in the tachocline , the interface between the convection zone and the radiative interior . due to buoyancy instabilities , \n they move upward and emerge into the solar atmosphere in the form of @xmath0-shaped flux tubes @xcite . \n the largest emerging active regions produce sunspots with magnetic fluxes in excess of @xmath4 mx and lifetimes of several weeks to months . \n smaller active regions consist of pores and contain an order of magnitude less flux , persisting over days to weeks . \n the smallest emerging regions detected to date are the so - called ephemeral regions . \n they have fluxes between @xmath5 and @xmath6 mx and lifetimes in the range from hours to days ( e. g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) .    outside of active regions , \n the quiet sun has proved to be full of magnetic fields with strengths roughly in equipartition with the photospheric convective flows @xcite . \n an important question is the origin of these fields . \n @xcite suggested that horizontal internetwork fields represent concentrated loops of flux carried to the surface by the upflows of granular convection or by magnetic buoyancy . in a recent paper , \n @xcite indirectly traced the emergence of magnetic flux and reconstructed , for the first time , the three dimensional topology of the magnetic field vector in quiet regions of the solar photosphere . \n it was found that at least 20% of the magnetic flux in the quiet sun is connected by low - lying magnetic loops . \n later , @xcite studied time series of spectropolarimetric observations taken with the solar optical telescope aboard _ hinode_. these authors followed the time evolution of one magnetic loop in the internetwork , showing that they appear on spatial scales smaller than 2@xmath7 . \n @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the emergence of magnetic flux on granular scales brings large amounts of horizontal fields to the photosphere both in plage regions and in the quiet sun . \n another form of flux emergence has been reported by @xcite . \n it involves the appearance and subsequent disappearance of what seem to be _ vertical _ fields at the center of granular cells . \n the observations strongly suggest that a significant fraction of the magnetic flux in the quiet sun might be the result of the emergence of small - scale magnetic loops . \n but , where do the loops come from ? are they created by the global solar dynamo , by a local dynamo , or by recycling of flux from decaying active regions ? is the emergence process a local phenomenon confined to the photosphere or does the magnetic flux reach higher atmospheric layers ? \n the answers to these questions bear important consequences for our understanding of the magnetic and thermal structure of the solar atmosphere . \n for example , @xcite claim that the magnetic energy stored in the quiet photosphere is sufficient to balance the radiative losses of the chromosphere . \n quiet sun magnetic fields are excellent candidates to solve the chromospheric and coronal heating problem , but a mechanism capable of transferring their energy to the upper layers has not been identified yet . from a theoretical point of view , it is not clear whether the fields of the quiet solar photosphere can rise to the chromosphere . @xcite \n have presented mhd simulations in which the magnetic field emerges into the photosphere in the form of small - scale @xmath0-loops . \n they reach the chromosphere and get reconnected with the local expanding vertical magnetic fields , heating the plasma and generating high frequency mhd waves that propagate into the corona . however , the magnetoconvection simulations of @xcite show @xmath0-loops that disintegrate as they rise through the solar atmosphere . \n these discrepancies emphasize the need for observational studies aimed at determining whether magnetic fields emerging into the quiet photosphere are able to reach higher atmospheric layers . here \n we use multi - wavelength observations taken by _ \n hinode _ and the dutch open telescope to address this question . \n we also characterize the physical properties of small - scale magnetic loops in the quiet sun , providing estimates of their magnetic fluxes , emergence rates , lifetimes , sizes , and velocities . \n the data analyzed in this paper consist of time series of polarimetric and imaging observations of quiet sun regions at disk center . \n they were acquired in seven different days ( 25 - 29 september , 1 and 6 october 2007 ) using the instruments of the solar optical telescope aboard hinode @xcite and the dutch open telescope ( dot ; * ? ? ? \n * ) at observatorio de el roque de los muchachos ( la palma , spain ) . \n the observations belong to the _ hinode _ operation plan 14 , entitled `` hinode / canary islands campaign '' . \n the _ hinode _ spectro - polarimeter ( sp ; * ? ? ? * ) recorded the full stokes vector of the pair of lines at 630  nm in a narrow field of view ( fov ) of @xmath8 . \n this region was scanned with a cadence of 28  s during 2 - 6 hours per day ( table [ tabla_obs ] ) . \n the exposure time per slit position was set to 1.6  s to track very rapid events . \n however , this mode of operation also led to a noise level of @xmath9 in units of the continuum intensity @xmath10 . with a pixel size of @xmath11 along the slit and @xmath12 perpendicular to it , \n the sp measurements have a spatial resolution of about @xmath13 .    the hinode narrowband filter imager ( nfi ; tsuneta et al . \n 2008 ) acquired stokes i and v filtergrams in the wings of the chromospheric mg i b 517.3 nm line , @xmath14  pm away from its center . \n the nfi was operated in shutterless mode to reach an effective exposure time of 9.6 s per wavelength and polarization state , covering a fov of @xmath15 . \n the original filtergrams had a pixel size of 0.08@xmath7 , but we rebined them to the sp pixel size in order to further reduce the noise . \n the _ hinode _ broadband filter imager ( bfi ; * ? ? ? * ) acquired simultaneous images of the photosphere in the cn bandhead at 388.3  nm ( filter width of 0.52  nm ) and the chromosphere in the caiih line at 396.85  nm ( filter width of 0.22  nm ) . \n the exposure times were 0.1 s and 0.3 s , respectively . \n the bfi covered a region of @xmath16 with a pixel size of @xmath17 . \n both the nfi and the bfi took images with a cadence of 30 s.    the area scanned by the sp represents a small part of the total fov of the nfi and the bfi . \n therefore , we have cospatial and cotemporal observations of the quiet sun tracing different heights in the atmosphere . \n the dot observed photospheric and chromospheric layers by means of a tunable lyot filter that scanned the intensity profile of the h@xmath18 line at five wavelength positions ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and 0   ) . \n the passband of the filter was 0.25   . \n speckle bursts of 100 frames were taken at each wavelength position every 30  s. following the standard reduction procedure at the dot , the individual filtergrams were reconstructed using a speckle masking technique ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . \n the reconstructed images cover a fov of @xmath21 and have a spatial resolution of about 0.2 . \n the dot and _ hinode _ carried out simultaneous observations , but there is little overlap between them because of bad weather conditions . \n the sp data have been corrected for dark current , flat - field , and instrumental cross - talk using the sp_prep.pro routine included in the solarsoft package . \n the algorithm applied to the hinode filtergrams ( fg_prep.pro ) removed dark current , hot pixels , and cosmic rays . \n the spectropolarimetric maps and the various filtergrams have been aligned with pixel accuracy using the granulation , g - band bright points , and network elements as a reference .    in fig . \n [ calcio ] we show time - averaged  h filtergrams and  b magnetograms for the seven days of observation . \n the h images have been trimmed to the size of the b fov . \n the rectangles represent the areas scanned by the sp . note the absence of strong brigthenings in the h maps , as expected for very quiet regions largely devoid of network elements . \n +    ccccc date &

mark the location of strong negative and positive circular signals . at @xmath30 \n s , a patch of linear polarization shows up at the center of the image . \n it corresponds to the horizontal part of a magnetic structure emerging into the photosphere . between @xmath31 and 60 s , two circular polarization patches of opposite polarity \n appear next to it , at the edge of a granular cell . \n the fact that the linear signal is detected earlier than the circular polarization indicates that the magnetic structure has the shape of an @xmath0-loop : the apex creates linear polarization and the vertical fields of the footpoints give rise to circular polarization @xcite . \n the linear polarization disappears below the noise at @xmath32  s while the footpoints separate with time . \n this sequence of events is consistent with a loop that emerges and travels up in the atmosphere . \n the distance between the footpoints keeps increasing until they reach the edges of the area scanned by the sp . the subsequent evolution of this loop \n will be studied in  [ description ] . \n the stokes @xmath33 and @xmath24 filtergrams acquired in the red and blue wings of the  b line give information about the upper photosphere / temperature minimum region @xcite . we have used them to construct longitudinal magnetograms ( @xmath34 ) and dopplergrams ( @xmath35 ) as @xmath36 where the subscripts r and b represent the measurements at @xmath37 and @xmath38  pm from line center , respectively . \n to first order , the magnetograms computed in this way are not affected by mass motions . \n the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 have been transformed into magnetic flux densities and line - of - sight velocities according to @xmath39 with @xmath40 in mx  cm@xmath1 and @xmath42 in km  s@xmath3 . \n equation [ dopplergram ] is valid in the range @xmath43  km  s@xmath3 . \n these expresions have been obtained through calibration of the b line shape in the fourier transform spectrometer atlas of the quiet sun @xcite and give only rough estimates of the magnetic flux density and velocity at the height of formation of the b measurements . since stokes q and u were not recorded , the mg i magnetograms can only be used to detect relatively vertical fields such as those expected at the footpoints of magnetic loops . by definition \n , fields pointing towards the observer and upflows will both be positive . \n note that our sign convention for the velocity differs from that commonly used in astrophysics .    in the chromosphere \n we do not have polarimetric information . \n however , magnetic fields can be detected through brightness enhancements in the h filtergrams . \n the passband of the _ hinode _ h filter includes a significant photospheric contribution , but it has a long tail that extends well into the chromosphere @xcite . \n finally , information on the upper chromosphere is provided by the h@xmath18 measurements taken at the dot . \n we have used them to construct dopplergrams at different heights in the chromosphere . \n we determine the magnetic flux density from the stokes @xmath24 profiles of the 630  nm lines using the weak field approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the longitudinal flux density , @xmath46 the filling factor , @xmath47 the field strength , @xmath48 the inclination of the field with respect to the vertical , @xmath49 a proportionality constant that depends on the central wavelength @xmath50 and the effective land factor @xmath51 of the transition , and @xmath33 represents the intensity profile . \n the units of @xmath40 are mx  cm@xmath1 when @xmath50 is expressed in \n .    the longitudinal flux density is obtained from a least - squares minimization of the form @xmath52}{\\partial \\phi}=0 , \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\left[\\sum_i \\left ( v_i+\\phi c\\frac{\\partial i}{\\partial \\lambda}_i\\right)^2\\right]=0 , \\label{weakfield}\\ ] ] which uses all the wavelength samples across the profile ( index @xmath53 ) and is therefore more accurate that determinations based on single magnetogram measurements . \n this calculation is repeated for each pixel and each spectral line separately . \n the final result is @xmath54    to estimate the uncertainty caused by photon noise we simulated a data set containing only gaussian noise with a standard deviation of @xmath55 @xmath10 . \n the analysis of this data set using eq . \n [ eq2 ] leads to a gaussian - shaped histogram for the magnetic flux density which is centered at 0 and has a standard deviation of @xmath56 mx  cm@xmath1 .    in figure [ hist_ratio_flux ] \n we check the assumption made on the zeeman regime . \n the plot shows an histogram of the ratio between the magnetic flux densities derived from 630.15 and 630.25  nm . \n only the stokes v spectra at the footpoints of the loops having amplitudes above 5 times the noise level have been considered . as can be seen , the histogram is narrow and peaks at 1 . \n the figure also shows a scatter plot of the magnetic flux densities obtained with the two lines . \n the fact that most of the points are located near the diagonal implies that in the majority of cases both spectral lines measure the same magnetic flux . \n this strongly supports the idea that the fields are weak . \n during 28 hours of observations we have detected the appearance of 69 loop - like structures in the @xmath57 region scanned with the hinode spectropolarimeter . \n table [ tabla ] summarizes their properties . \n the observed loops followed very similar evolution patterns . in this section \n we describe specific cases to illustrate the emergence process , distinguishing between loops that rise to the chromosphere and loops that remain low - lying . \n one of the clearest examples of a loop that reached the chromosphere was loop ml09 , observed on september 25 , 2007 at 14:39 ut . \n its evolution is summarized in figs . \n [ ej1_crom ] and [ ej1_crom2 ] . \n each row represents a time step , for a total of 1020 s. from left to right we show cn filtergrams , photospheric los velocities derived from the stokes @xmath24 zero - crossing shifts of 630.25  nm , total circular polarization maps in 632.05  nm , magnetic flux densities computed from  b 517.3  nm , los velocities at the height of formation of the  b line , and h line - core filtergrams . \n positive velocities indicate upflows . \n note that the time steps are not evenly spaced ; rather , we have adjusted them to better describe the various phases of the process . \n the red contours mark regions of large linear polarization signals in 630.25 nm . \n when the footpoints of the loop are visible in the photosphere , we plot contours of 630.25  nm circular polarization in black and white for the negative and positive signals , respectively . \n when the footpoints are only visible in the  b magnetogram we plot them in blue and turquoise .    the first row of fig . \n [ ej1_crom ] shows the emergence of linear polarization above a granule ( cf . \n the white arrow in the cn filtergram ) . \n it is caused by the horizontal part of the loop reaching the photosphere . \n the footpoints are not yet visible but will appear 30  s later , very close to the patch of linear polarization . at @xmath58 \n the loop is completely formed . \n it emerges in a granular region , perhaps because the upward granular motions help the field lines to rise from below the solar surface @xcite . \n the los velocity maps show photospheric upflows at the position of the footpoints , confirming that the loop is rising . for the moment \n , however , the magnetic field remains in the lower photosphere : we do not observe circular polarization signals in the b magnetograms or brightenings in caiih that could be associated with the loop . \n interestingly , the strong photospheric network element with negative polarity located towards the bottom of the scan , at a height of about one fourth of the displayed fov , is well observed both in the b magnetograms and the ca filtergrams , and will remain so during most of the time sequence . \n this nicely illustrates the capabilities of our observations : magnetic structures that are visible in the polarization maps but not in  b or h are intrinsically lower in the solar atmosphere \n .    between @xmath59 s and @xmath60 s the linear polarization signals disappear below the noise . \n the positive footpoint has drifted to an intergranular lane and is concentrated , whereas the negative footpoint continues to be rooted in the granule and is more diffuse . \n the distance between them increases steadily . \n we still see upward motions in the photospheric velocity maps . \n since the loop is moving to higher layers , it is reasonable to conclude that the linear polarization disappears because the apex of the loop leaves the formation region of the 630  nm lines . \n however , no traces of the loop are detected yet in  b or h.    at @xmath61 s , weak circular polarization signals cospatial with the photospheric footpoints are observed in the b magnetograms for the first time . \n this indicates that the loop has reached the upper photospheric / lower chromospheric layers where the central part of the  b line forms . \n interestingly , the  b dopplergram exhibits downflows of about @xmath62  km  s@xmath3 at the position of the positive footpoint . \n the downflows could represent plasma moving along the legs of the loop as the whole structure reaches high atmospheric layers . \n these motions may be essential for the loop to get rid of part of its mass before it can emerge into a less dense medium .    at @xmath63 \n s , the loop is nearly out of the region scanned by the sp . \n the signals in the  b magnetogram are much more intense and correspond to footpoints rooted in intergranular lanes . from now on the distance between the footpoints will increase , but at a slower rate than when they were crossing granular structures . \n this inflection point can be seen in fig . \n [ dist ] , where we plot the footpoint separation as a function of time . \n the distance is computed only when the two footpoints are visible , both in the maps ( squares ) and in the  b magnetograms ( triangles ) . in the first 500 s of the loop evolution , the distance between the footpoints increases linearly at a rate of 5.9  km  s@xmath3 . \n therefore , the mean velocity of the footpoints is 2.95  km  s@xmath3 , a value compatible with the motion of the granular plasma . \n the linear increase of the separation with time is a common feature of the loops and indicates that they do not undergo a free random walk ( otherwise the distance would increase as the square root of time ) . towards the end of the loop evolution \n the separation rate slows down , coinciding with the arrival of the footpoints to intergranular lanes . \n summarizing , the loop emerges in a granule and the horizontal granular motions drive the magnetic field lines to the closest intergranular space , where strong downdrafts capture and stabilize them . when this happens , the separation between the footpoints is about 4000  km .    at @xmath64 \n s , the footpoints are clearly visible in the  b magnetogram and exhibit downflows in the b dopplergram . \n the whole structure is rising because the footpoints continue to separate . \n however , no brightenings are detected in the h filtergrams . \n we mention in passing that a new loop appear in the fov at this time , very close to the site of emergence of the structure we are describing in detail . \n they show a linear polarization signal in between opposite polarities , which makes it easy to identify .    at @xmath65 \n s , the loop has reached the chromosphere since we observe two h brightenings associated with the footpoints ( in fig . \n [ ej1_crom2 ] , the contours have been substituted by arrows for clarity ) . \n the legs of the loop still show downflows in the  b dopplergrams and , for the first time , bright points are observed in the cn images at the position of the footpoints . \n the last panels of fig . \n [ ej1_crom2 ] displays the beginning of the loop decay . \n the positive footpoint is very weak , although it still shows downflows at the height of formation of the  b measurements . \n it will disappear below the noise level , together with the downdrafts , at the end of the sequence . \n the negative footpoint is approaching a negative polarity patch with whom it will eventually mix . \n the negative footpoint shows downflows and is associated with a bright point in  h. these features will survive the disappearance of the footpoint thanks to the interaction with the network element .      in this section we present a typical example of a loop which do not show chromospheric signatures and thus remain low - lying . \n figure [ ej1_nocrom ] shows all the data available for this loop ( ml23 ) , arranged as in fig . \n [ ej1_crom ] .    in the first frame , \n a patch of linear polarization is observed to emerge at the border of a granule ( see the white arrow ) . \n the footpoints can already be detected in the intergranular lane , but they are very weak . at this time the photospheric velocity map exhibits a patch of upflows at the position of the loop , confirming its rise through the solar atmosphere .    at @xmath66 \n s the loop reaches its largest extent ( 520 km ) while the upflows start to weaken . \n the linear polarization and the upward plasma motions are almost gone by @xmath67 s. in the next frame , at @xmath68 s , the loop is no longer seen . \n the evolution of the loop is so rapid that it appears and disappears almost at the same place . \n interestingly , the footpoints never approach each other . \n this rules out submergence below the solar surface as the cause of the loop disappearance . \n all the loops that stay in the photosphere show very similar behaviors . in general , \n the evolve very quickly , disappearing not far from the region where they emerged . \n none of these loops exhibit downflows in the  b line or brightenings in the cn or ca filtergrams . \n in the previous section we have seen that small - scale magnetic loops in the quiet sun may rise through the atmosphere and reach the layers where the central part of the  b 517.3  nm line is formed . \n some of them also produce  h brightness enhancements . in this context \n , the question naturally arises as to the maximum height that these structures can attain . \n are they able to reach the upper chromosphere or even the corona ?    here we use the h@xmath18 observations of the dot to provide a partial answer to this question . \n unfortunately , there is little overlap between the _ hinode _ and dot measurements because of bad seeing conditions . nevertheless , for one of the loops detected by _ \n there is simultaneous coverage from the dot . \n we use these data to attempt to observe the rise of the loop to the upper chromosphere . \n the analysis is not complete and must be refined with euv and x - ray observations tailored to the detection of such magnetic structures in the hot corona . \n the loop observed simultaneously by _ \n hinode _ and the dot ( ml20 ) appeared on september 26 , 2007 , at 09:06 ut . in fig . \n [ ej2_crom_todos ] we show its evolution in the photosphere / temperature minimum region using the 630.25  nm circular polarization maps and the  b magnetograms ( first and second columns , respectively ) . \n the figure also displays h@xmath18 line core filtergrams , as well as h@xmath18 dopplergrams at @xmath20  and @xmath19  from line center \n . if the loop reaches the layers where h@xmath18 is formed , it should first appear in the fifth column , then in the fourth , and finally in the third . \n the loop emerged as a small patch of linear polarization at the border of a granule ( @xmath69 s , not shown ) . \n its subsequent evolution is similar to that of the loop considered in fig . \n [ ej1_crom ] . \n the footpoints of the loop are detected in the photosphere for the first time at @xmath70 s. the whole structure shows upflows in the stokes v zero - crossing maps , indicating its ascent . \n unfortunately , the negative footpoint is close to the border of the fov scanned by the sp and soon disappears from the photospheric maps . \n the loop becomes visible in the  b magnetograms at @xmath71  s. at this time there is clear signal in the negative footpoint and weaker polarization in the positive leg . at @xmath65  s \n both footpoints show stronger magnetogram signals but the distance between them has not increased . \n the ascent of the loop to the chromosphere is associated with downflows in the  b dopplergram and brightenings in the caiih line - core images . the and  b signals start to fade at @xmath72 s until the loop disappears simultaneously from the low and the upper photospheric layers . \n the h@xmath18 line core images and the dopplergrams do not show any particular feature that could be associated with the appearence of an arch filament system in the chromosphere . \n it is important to remark that the maximum separation between the footpoints of this loop was only 760 km . \n it may well be that a larger separation is required for the apex of the loop to reach the upper chromosphere . \n in fact , excessive magnetic tension might prevent the field lines from rising . keeping in mind these considerations \n , we do not discard that magnetic loops with larger separations may be seen in future h@xmath18 observations . \n in this section we characterize the physical properties of the small - scale magnetic loops observed with _ \n weak examples and loops appearing close to strong network elements or in crowded areas are omitted from the analysis to maintain the quality of the results . \n this leaves us with 33 loops , which represents 48% of the total sample . \n table [ tabla ] lists the basic parameters of the loops , including lifetimes ( @xmath73 ) , maximum distances between footpoints ( @xmath74 ) , speeds at which the footpoints separate initially ( @xmath75 ) , total magnetic fluxes ( @xmath76 ) and maximum flux densities ( @xmath77 ) in the photosphere , estimations of maximum magnetic flux densities at the height of formation of the  b measurements ( @xmath78 ) , and an estimation of the largest downflows detected in the  b dopplergrams ( @xmath79 ) . \n the lifetime is the time elapsed between the appearance and disappearance of the polarization signals . \n when two numbers are given , the first indicates the time passed until one of the footpoints interacts with a neighboring magnetic element . \n the second is the time of disappearance proper ; if it is accompanied by an asterisk , then the polarization signatures of the loop were still visible at the end of the observations . to compute the total magnetic flux \n we define the footpoints as those regions where the flux density is larger than @xmath80 at the position of the loop . \n the value of @xmath81 reported in table [ tabla ] is the maximum flux detected in one of the footpoints during the loop evolution , and the error indicates the uncertainty in @xmath81 caused by photon noise . \n the last four columns of table [ tabla ] give the time intervals between the appearance of the loops in the photosphere and their detection in the  b magnetograms , the  b dopplergrams , the  h line core images , and the cn filtergrams . \n we consider that a loop is present in any of these maps when at least one of the footpoints shows up clearly . \n the two numbers in each column correspond to the positive footpoint ( left ) and the negative one ( right ) . \n cccccccccccccc name & date & t@xmath82 & @xmath83 t & d@xmath84 & @xmath85 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 & @xmath88 & @xmath89

10 minutes . \n the maximum separation between the footpoints is a strong function of the lifetime and ranges from @xmath142  km to 4000 km . \n many loops reach horizontal dimensions comparable to , or larger than , those of granules . \n therefore , they must be viewed as coherent structures capable of withstanding the conditions of the granular environment for a relatively long time . \n the initial velocity of separation between the footpoints does not seem to have any relationship with the other parameters listed in the table . \n values of 0.1 to 6  km  s@xmath3 are typical . \n as already mentioned , the separation speed tends to decrease when the footpoints reach the intergranular space , likely because horizontal motions there are not as vigorous as in the interior of granular cells . \n the longitudinal magnetic fluxes measured in the footpoints range from @xmath143 to @xmath144 mx at the level of formation of the 630 nm lines mx , considerably larger than the rest of values . \n this might be an artifact caused by the difficult separation of ml24 and the strong network element with which it interacts . ] . \n therefore , the loops have smaller fluxes than ephemeral regions and should be placed at the lower end of the flux distribution observed in emerging active regions . \n the magnetic flux density in the footpoints is typically 2040  mx  cm@xmath3 . to infer the magnetic field strength from the magnetic flux density values we need to know the filling factor of the field lines that build the loop structure and their inclination . \n the footpoints should be relatively vertical because of geometrical reasons . \n assuming that the fields occupy most of the resolution element , i.e. , that the magnetic filling factor is close to unity the field strength of the loops can be estimated to be of order 10 - 100  g. only if the filling factor is much smaller than unity would the field strength increase to kg values , but we consider this possibility unlikely in view of fig . \n [ hist_ratio_flux ] . \n an important result is that 23% of the loops are detected in the b magnetograms after their appearance in the photosphere ( 16 cases out of 69 ) . \n it takes an average of 5 minutes for the loops to move from the photosphere to the height at which the b measurements form , although faster and slower ascents have been observed too . \n all the loops detected in the  b magnetograms develop downflows at the same heights . \n in addition , 15% of the loops are seen as bright points in  h line - core filtergrams . \n this means that an important fraction of the magnetic flux that emerges into the photosphere reaches the chromosphere . as they travel upward , \n the loops are observed in the magnetograms , the  b magnetograms , the  b dopplergrams , the  h line - core images , and the cn filtergrams ( in this order ) .    by contrast , 77% of the loops never make it to the chromosphere . \n we have been unable to identify any parameter determining whether a given loop will rise or not . \n this includes the total magnetic flux and the magnetic flux density \n . however , low - lying loops tend to have lifetimes shorter than 500  s and separations smaller than 500 km . thus it may simply be that they do not last long enough to reach high atmospheric layers . \n further work is clearly needed to explain why a substantial fraction of the loops remain low - lying . \n also , the relation between these structures and the transient horizontal fields described by @xcite should be investigated , given their similar lifetimes and magnetic topologies . \n the observations described above demonstrate that magnetic fields do emerge into the quiet solar atmosphere in the form of small - scale loops , confirming the results of @xcite and @xcite . \n the loops are detected as a patch of linear polarization flanked by two circular polarization signals of opposite polarity . in nearly all the cases \n the linear polarization appears before or at the same time than the stokes @xmath24 signals , as can be expected from @xmath0-shaped loops rising through the atmosphere . only in two cases out of 69 \n have we detected linear polarization after the loop had already disappeared . in those cases \n , the footpoints were approaching each other . \n this behavior is compatible with a loop that emerges and then submerges in the photosphere , or with a `` magnetic bubble '' , i.e. , a circle of magnetic field lines . \n the long duration of our time series has permitted us to discover the existence of emergence centers in which several loops appear one after the other . \n for example , there is a @xmath146 region of the solar surface where we have detected 9 events in a time interval of 1 h. the complete set of observations covering this period is provided as an mpeg animation in the electronic edition of the astrophysical journal . \n some of the loops even appear at the very same position . \n the example shown in fig . \n [ ej1_crom ] belongs to this area . \n the existence of emergence centers may have important consequences for the origin of the loops . \n these regions act as subsurface reservoirs of magnetic flux that is transferred intermittently to the photosphere by an as yet unkwnown mechanism . \n the loops generally emerge in granules or at their edges , although there are exceptions of loops appearing in dark areas . \n as the loops emerge the footpoints separate and the linear polarization fades away . in most cases , \n the footpoints do not describe rectilinear trajectories . \n figure [ trayectorias ] shows the paths followed by the two polarities of the loops observed on september 25 , 2007 ( loops ml09 to ml17 in the table 2 ) . \n the red curves correspond to the example discussed in fig.[ej1_crom ] . in this case \n the footpoints described quite a rectilinear path , similarly to emerging active regions and ephemeral regions . \n however , the majority of loops show more complicated trajectories . \n the reason is that , in general , they emerge in granules and drift toward the closest intergranular lane . when the footpoints reach the intergranular space they stay there and are passively advected by the flow . \n this creates complicated trajectories . \n the important point , however , is that the magnetic field is sufficiently weak as to be pushed and moved around by the granular flow , but _ without being destroyed in the process_. the loops remain coherent during all their lifetime , as if the granular flow did not exist .    during their evolution , \n the loops interact with other magnetic flux concentrations that cross their paths . \n if the loops stay long in the photosphere , the footpoints cancel with elements of opposite polarity or are absorbed by patches of the same polarity . \n loops that experience a fast evolution have more probabilities of avoiding other magnetic elements and often disappear without undergoing any interaction .    in seeking the origin of the loops it is of interest to determine the magnetic orientation of their footpoints . \n if the loops are caused by the global solar dynamo , one may expect a regular ordering of the footpoints at the moment of emergence . \n this is what happens in active regions , where the signs of the leader and follower polarities are governed by hale s rules ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n all the loops considered here appeared in the northern hemisphere during solar cycle 23 . in that cycle , \n leader polarities were positive in the northern hemisphere and negative in the southern hemisphere . \n figure [ tilt ] shows an histogram of the orientation of our small - scale emerging loops . \n the tilt angle is defined to be the angle between the solar equator and the line joining the positive footpoint with the negative one , measured from the west . \n the angles compatible with the orientation of sunspot polarities during solar cycle 23 in the northern hemisphere are those between 90 and 270@xmath147 . even if the statistical sample is not very large , the loops seem to have nearly random orientations . \n thus , we conclude that they do not obey hale s polarity rules , much in the same way as the shortest - lived ephemeral regions @xcite . \n recent observations of hanle - sensitive lines @xcite and zeeman - sensitive lines @xcite suggest that a significant fraction of the quiet sun is occupied by magnetic fields \n . apparently , these fields are weak and isotropically distributed in inclination @xcite . \n one way to shed light on their nature is to study how they emerge in the surface and what their contribution is to the energy budget of the solar atmosphere .    on granular scales \n , magnetic flux appears in the solar photosphere as transient horizontal fields @xcite and small - scale magnetic loops @xcite . \n we have studied the latter in detail using seeing - free observations made by _ \n hinode_. in 28 hours of _ hinode _ data we have detected 69 small - scale loops emerging in a quiet sun region of size @xmath148 at disk center . \n the occurrence rate is thus 0.02 events hr@xmath3 arcsec@xmath1 . \n the loops show clear spectropolarimetric signatures with a central region of linear polarization and two patches of circular polarization of opposite polarity . \n the longitudinal flux observed in each footpoint ranges from @xmath143 to @xmath144 mx , with an average of @xmath149 mx . \n this means that the loops represent the smallest emerging flux regions detected to date ( ephemeral regions have fluxes above 10@xmath150 mx ; zwaan 1987 ) . \n the rate at which magnetic flux is carried to the quiet photosphere by the loops can be estimated to be @xmath151  mx  s@xmath3  arcsec@xmath1 , or @xmath152  mx over the solar surface per day . \n this is about half the value derived by lites et al . \n ( 1996 ) for horizontal internetwork fields , but still enormous ( see @xcite for a comparison with the flux emergence rates in active and ephemeral regions ) .    in the photosphere , \n the linear polarization associated with the top of the loop disappears soon , while the circular signals tracing the loop legs are observed to separate with time . \n this behavior is consistent with field lines moving upward through the solar atmosphere . \n also the upflows observed in the stokes v zero - crossing velocities at the position of the footpoints confirm the ascent of the loops . \n 23% of the loops are detected in  b magnetograms that sample the upper photosphere or the temperature minimum region ( say , 400  km above the continuum forming layer ) . \n there is a time delay of about 5 minutes between the first detection in the photosphere and the appearance in the  b magnetograms , implying an ascent speed of the order of 1  km  @xmath3 . \n some of the loops continue to travel upward and become visible in  h line - core filtergrams as small brightness enhancements . \n thus , a fraction of the loops are able to reach the low chromosphere , carrying magnetic flux with them . \n the rise of small - scale magnetic loops may provide an efficient mechanism to transfer substantial amounts of energy from the photosphere to the chromosphere . \n this would support claims by @xcite and @xcite that the tangled fields of the quiet sun store sufficient energy to heat the chromosphere . \n a related question is whether the small - scale loops rise up to the transition region or even the corona . \n the observations required to answer this question are quite challenging due to the different spatial resolutions attainable with present day optical , euv , and x - ray instruments , but should be pursued . \n about 77% of the loops that appear in the solar surface never rise to the chromosphere . \n these loops have the shortest lifetimes and show the smallest footpoint separations ; other than that , they do not differ from those reaching higher layers . \n usually , they disappear close to their emergence sites . \n the fields associated with these loops might represent the tangled quiet sun fields deduced from hanle measurements @xcite , but a definite conclusion can not be made without studying the compatibility of hanle and zeeman measurements .    what is the origin of the small - scale magnetic loops ? \n one possibility is that they are created by the solar dynamo at the bottom of the convection zone , as part of a larger toroidal flux tube . \n @xcite presented three - dimensional mhd simulations of the last stages of the emergence of one such tube . \n they placed a horizontal tube at the top of the convection zone , just beneath the photosphere . when the initial magnetic flux is smaller than @xmath15310@xmath150 mx , the tube is not sufficiently buoyant to rise coherently against the convective flows and fragments . at the surface \n , the process of flux emergence occurs on very small spatial scales ( typically 1000 - 2000 km ) and short time scales ( 5 min ) . \n these properties are compatible with our observations . \n thus , the small - scale loops we have detected may simply be the result of weak flux tubes distorted by the granulation as they emerge from the convection zone into the photosphere . \n the fragmentation of the tubes might explain why there are emergence centers where loops appear recurrently one after the other . \n a preliminary analysis of the footpoint orientations suggests that the loops do not show a tendency to be aligned according to hale s rules . \n this can be regarded as a considerable difficulty against the idea that the origin of the loops is the solar dynamo . \n however , it may also be a natural consequence of the interaction of the tube s fragments with the near - surface granular convection if it removes all the information carried originally by the tube . \n another possibility is that the magnetic loops represent flux recycled from decaying active regions . in a sense , the mhd simulations of abbett ( 2007 ) , @xcite , and @xcite model such a process , because all of them assume an initial magnetic field in the computational box which could be provided by decaying active regions . in the simulations , \n the field evolve and interact with the granular flows . \n this interaction creates a significant amount of horizontal fields , even if the initial field is purely vertical . \n moreover , the simulations show the emergence of magnetic loops on granular scales . \n the loops are less coherent than classical flux tubes and do not connect to deeply rooted field lines . in this scenario , the magnetic fields of the quiet sun , and thus the emergence events we have described , would be the consequence of local processes acting on the remnants of decaying active regions . \n yet another possibility is that the loops represent submerged horizontal magnetic fields carried to the surface by the upward motions of granules or by magnetic buoyancy , as modeled by @xcite . even in that case \n , the origin of such submerged fields would be unknown . \n nowadays , we do not have enough observational constraints to distinguish between a surface dynamo or a `` exploding '' magnetic flux tube emerging from the solar interior . \n determining the nature of the magnetic loops observed in internetwork regions is important for a better understanding of the magnetism of the quiet sun and its role in the heating of the solar atmosphere . \n future efforts should concentrate on the solution of these problems . \n in addition to high - resolution photospheric observations , polarization measurements in the chromosphere are recquired to track the evolution of the loops with height . \n these data can now be provided by two - dimensional spectrometers like ibis , crisp , or imax . \n we thank andrs asensio ramos , pascal dmoulin and rafael

        "abstract": "This paper explores the dynamics of small-scale magnetic loops in the quiet Sun's photosphere, specifically focusing on their emergence and subsequent ascent through the solar atmosphere. By utilizing multi-wavelength observations from Hinode and the Dutch Open Telescope, we investigate the physical properties, emergence rates, and lifetimes of these loops. The study reveals that while a significant fraction of the loops ascend to the chromosphere, many remain confined to the photosphere. These observations are crucial for understanding the magnetic and thermal structure of the solar atmosphere and potentially addressing the chromospheric and coronal heating problems."

        "article": "the current observations , such as sneia ( supernovae type ia ) , cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) and large scale structure , converge on the fact that a spatially homogeneous and gravitationally repulsive energy component , referred as dark energy , accounts for about @xmath1 % of the energy density of universe . \n some heuristic models that roughly describe the observable consequences of dark energy were proposed in recent years , a number of them stemming from a certain physics @xcite and the others being purely phenomenological @xcite . \n dark energy can even behave as a phantom and effectively violate the weak energy condition@xcite .    in various cosmological models , \n fundamental quantities are either geometrical ( if they are constructed from a spacetime geometry directly ) or physical ( if they depend upon physical fields ) . \n physical quantities are certainly model - dependent , while geometrical quantites are more universal . \n about thirty years ago , the bouncing cosmological model with torsion was suggested in ref.@xcite , but the torsion was imagined as playing role only at high densities in the early universe . \n goenner et al . made a general survey of the torsion cosmology @xcite , in which the equations for all the pgt ( poincar gauge theory of gravity ) cases were discussed although they only solved in detail a few particular cases . \n recently some authors have begun to study torsion as a possible reason of the accelerating universe @xcite . \n nester and collaborators @xcite consider an accounting for the accelerated universe in term of a riemann - cartan geometry : dynamic scalar torsion . \n they explore the possibility that the dynamic pgt connection , reflecting the nature of dynamic pgt torsion , provides the accelerating force . with the usual assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy in cosmology and specific cases of the suitable parameters and initial conditions , they find that torsion field could play a role of dark energy \n .    one of the motivation was to avoid singularities in the initial investigations of torsion cosmology @xcite . \n however , it soon was found that non - linear torsion effects were more likely to produce stronger singularities @xcite . \n the non - linear effects turn out to play a key role for the outstanding present day mystery : the accelerated universe . in the various pgt , \n the connection dynamics decomposed into six modes with certain spin and parity : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 . \n some investigations showed that @xmath4 may well be the only acceptable dynamic pgt torsion modes @xcite . \n the pseudoscalar mode @xmath5 is naturally driven by the intrinsic spin of elementary fermions , therefore it naturally interacts with such sources . \n consequently , it is generally thought that axial torsion must be small and have small effects at the late time of cosmological evolution . \n this is a major reason why one does not focus on this mode at the late time . on the other hand , the scalar mode @xmath6 does not interact in any direct obvious fashion with any known type of matter @xcite , \n therefore one can imagine it as having significant magnitude and yet not being conspicuously noticed . \n furthermore , there is a critical non - zero value for the affine scalar curvature since @xmath6 mode can interact indirectly through the non - linear equations . \n the homogeneity and isotropy of cosmology have received strong confirmation from modern observations , which greatly restrict the possible types of non - vanishing fields . under the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy \n , @xmath6 mode has only a time component and it can be specified as the gradient of a time - dependent function . \n therefore , the cosmological models with the scalar mode offer a situation where dynamic torsion may lead to observable effect at late time . \n we emphasize again that one does not focus on the early universe , where one could indeed expect large effects ( though their signature would have to be separated from other large effects ) , and substitutionally asks about traces of torsion effects at the late time of cosmological evolution @xcite . \n obviously , the fine - tuning problem is one of the most important issues for the torsion cosmology @xcite . and a good model should limit the fine - tuning as much as possible . \n the dynamical attractor of the cosmological system has been employed to make the later time behaviors of the model insensitive to the initial condition of the field and thus alleviates the fine - tuning problem @xcite . \n furthermore , nester et al @xcite have shown that the hubble parameter and @xmath7 have an oscillatory form for the scalar torsion cosmology .    the traditional geometrical parameters , i.e. , the hubble parameter @xmath8 and the deceleration parameter @xmath9 , are two elegant choices to describe the expansion state of universe but they can not distinguish various accelerating mechanism uniquely , because a quite number of models may just correspond to the same current values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . \n however , sahni , saini , starobinsky and alam @xcite have introduced the statefinder pair @xmath12 : @xmath13 , @xmath14 . \n it is obviously a natural next step beyond @xmath10 and @xmath11 . \n fortunately , as is shown in the literatures @xcite , the statefinder parameters which are also geometrical diagnostics , are able to differentiate a series of cosmological models successfully . using the discussion of statefinder parameters in the scalar torsion cosmology , \n we explain easily why the present field equations modify the expansion of the universe only at late time . \n if the evolving trajectory of statefinder have a decelerating phase ( @xmath15 ) at early time , then we can understand why the expansion of the universe until @xmath16 remains unchanged in the scalar torsion models .    in this paper \n , we apply the statefinder diagnostics to the torsion cosmology . \n we find that there are some characteristics of statefinder parameters for the torsion cosmology that can be distinguished from the other cosmological models . \n the statefinder diagnostics show that the universe naturally has an accelerating expansion at low redshifts ( late time ) and a decelerating expansion at high redshifts ( early time ) . therefore \n , scalar torsion cosmology can avoid some of the problems which occur in other models . \n especially , the effect of torsion can make the expansion rate oscillate when torsion parameter @xmath17 or @xmath18 . whether the universe has properties which are easier to explain within the scalar torsion context is a remarkable possibility demanding further exploration . \n the oscillatory feature of hubble parameter had earlier been reported for the braneworld cosmology @xcite and the quasi - steady state cosmology @xcite . \n we show that statefinder diagnostic has a direct bearing on the critical points of the dynamical system . \n one of the most interesting characteristic of the trajectories is that there are loop and curves with the shape of tadpole in the case of the torsion parameter @xmath19 . in this case \n , we fit the scalar torsion model to current type ia supernova data and find it is consistent with the observations . \n furthermore , we analyze preliminarily the relevance for realistic observation of the found statefinder parameters . \n pgt @xcite has been regarded as an interesting alternative to general relativity because of its gauge structure and geometric properties . \n pgt based on a riemann - cartan geometry , allows for dynamic torsion in addition to curvature . \n the affine connection of the riemann - cartan geometry is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the levi - civita connection and @xmath22 is the torsion tensor . \n meantime , the ricci curvature and scalar curvature can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the riemannian ricci curvature and scalar curvature , respectively , and @xmath26 is the covariant derivative with the levi - civita connection ( for a detailed discussion see ref . \n . theoretical analysis of pgt led us to consider tendentiously dynamic `` scalar mode '' . in this case , the restricted expression of the torsion can be written as @xcite @xmath27\\kappa},\\label{trestrct}\\ ] ] where the vector @xmath28 is the trace of the torsion . \n then , the ricci curvature and scalar curvature can be expressed as @xmath29 the gravitational lagrangian density for the scalar mode is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath0 is a torsion parameter . \n consider that the parameter @xmath32 is associated with quadratic scalar curvature term @xmath33 , so that @xmath32 should be positive @xcite . \n therefore , the field equations of the scalar mode are @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the source energy - momentum tensor and @xmath36 is the contribution of the scalar torsion mode to the effective total energy - momentum tensor : @xmath37    since current observations favor a flat universe , we will work in the spatially flat robertson - walker metric @xmath38 $ ] , where @xmath39 is the scalar factor . \n this engenders the riemannian ricci curvature and scalar curvature : @xmath40 where @xmath39 is the scalar factor , and @xmath10 is the hubble parameter . \n the torsion @xmath41 should also be only time dependent , therefore one can let @xmath42 ( @xmath43 is the torsion field ) and the spatial parts vanish . \n the corresponding equations of motion in the matter - dominated era are as follows @xmath44 where @xmath45 and the energy density of matter component @xmath46    one can scale the variables and the parameters as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the present value of hubble parameter and @xmath49 is the planck length . under the transform ( [ scale ] ) , eqs . \n ( [ dth])-([dtr ] ) remain unchanged . \n after transform , new variables @xmath50 , @xmath10 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and new parameters @xmath53 , @xmath0 , @xmath54 and @xmath32 are all dimensionless . obviously , the newtonian limit requires @xmath55 .    for the case of scalar torsion mode \n , the effective energy -

oscillating at late time and @xmath67 is negative today , which means the expansion of the universe is currently accelerating . \n the value of @xmath11 turns from positive to negative when the time is around @xmath68 , which is the epoch the universe began to accelerate . \n however , the above result is dependent on the choice of initial data and the values of the parameters . \n then , the scalar torsion cosmology is unsuited to solving the fine - tuning problem in the case of @xmath65 . in the following sections \n , we ll investigate the statefinder and give the dynamics analysis for all ranges of the parameter @xmath0 . \n for the spatially flat @xmath69cdm model the statefinder parameters correspond to a fixed point @xmath70 while @xmath71 for the standard cold dark matter model ( scdm ) containing no radiation . \n since the torsion cosmology have used the dynamic scalar torsion ( a geometry quantity in the riemann - cartan spacetime ) , the torsion accelerating mechanism is bound to exhibit an essential distinction in contrast with various dark energy models . \n therefore , its statefinder diagnostic is sure to reveal differential feature . \n let us now study the torsion cosmological model in detail . using eqs . \n ( [ dth])-([fieldrho ] ) , we have the deceleration parameter @xmath72(432a_{1}h^{2})^{-1}\\,,\\label{torsionq }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the statefinder parameters @xmath73(108a_{1}bh^{3})^{-1}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{torsionr }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath74}{3bh\\left[(6\\mu + br)(36h^{2}-24h\\phi + 4\\phi^{2}-3r)-54\\mu r\\right]}\\ , . \\label{torsions }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the following we will discuss the statefinder for four differential ranges of the torsion parameter @xmath0 , respectively . \n firstly , we consider the time evolution of the statefinder pairs @xmath12 and @xmath75 in the case of @xmath76 . in fig . \n [ planecase4 ] , we plot evolution trajectories in the @xmath77 and @xmath78 planes , where we have chosen @xmath79 and @xmath80 . \n we see easily that cosmic expansion alternates between deceleration and acceleration in the evolving trajectories of @xmath77 plane , and the amplitude becomes larger and larger as increase of time . \n the trajectories in the @xmath78 plane is quite complicated , so we mark its sequence by the ordinal number . \n every odd number curve evolves from finite to infinite , but even number curve evolves from infinite to finite . \n these are quasi - periodic behaviors which corresponds to the numerical solution of ref . \n noticeably , the trajectories will never pass @xmath69cdm point @xmath70 . \n secondly , we discuss the time evolution of the statefinder pairs @xmath12 and @xmath75 for the case of @xmath81 . \n we plot evolving trajectories in fig . \n [ planecase3 ] , where we have chosen @xmath82 and @xmath83 . \n we see clearly that the cosmic acceleration is guaranteed by the dynamic scalar torsion in the evolving trajectories of @xmath77 plane , and the curves will converge into @xmath69cdm point . \n the evolving trajectories go through a climbing - up stage first , then get into a rolling - down stage in the @xmath78 plane . \n lastly , trajectories tend to @xmath69cdm point @xmath70 . \n furthermore , the only one forms a loop that starts from @xmath70 then evolves back to @xmath70 , and others show in the shape of tadpole .     and @xmath78 planes for the case of torsion parameter @xmath84 , where we choose the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 . \n the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   and @xmath78 planes for the case of torsion parameter @xmath84 , where we choose the parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 . \n the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]     and @xmath78 planes for the case of torsion parameter @xmath87 , where we choose the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 . \n the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   and @xmath78 planes for the case of torsion parameter @xmath87 , where we choose the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 . \n the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]     and @xmath90 planes for the case of @xmath91 , where we choose @xmath92 and @xmath93 . \n the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   and @xmath90 planes for the case of @xmath91 , where we choose @xmath92 and @xmath93 . \n the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=257 ]     and @xmath78 planes for the case of torsion parameter @xmath94 , where we choose the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath86 . \n the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   and @xmath78 planes for the case of torsion parameter @xmath94 , where we choose the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath86 . \n the arrows show the direction of the time evolution.,title=\"fig:\",width=257 ]    thirdly , we discuss the time evolution of the trajectories for the case of @xmath96 . \n we plot evolving trajectories in fig . \n [ planecase2 ] , where we have chosen @xmath97 and @xmath98 . obviously , the cosmic acceleration can happen since deceleration parameter is negative . \n @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 become larger and larger first , then less and less as the cosmic time increase .    finally , we consider the time evolution of the statefinder pairs @xmath12 and @xmath75 in the case of @xmath18 . in fig . \n [ planecase1 ] , we plot evolving trajectories in the @xmath77 and @xmath78 planes , where we have chosen @xmath102 and @xmath80 . \n we find easily that the evolving trajectories analogous to the case of @xmath103 except trajectories pass the @xmath69cdm point . \n to sum up , it is very interesting to see that the scalar torsion naturally provide the accelerating force in the universe for any torsion parameter @xmath0 . \n however , it is dependent on torsion parameters that there is a decelerating ( @xmath15 ) expansion before an accelerating ( @xmath104 ) expansion . \n the statefinder diagnostics show that the universe naturally has an accelerating expansion at low redshifts ( late time ) and a decelerating expansion at high redshifts ( early time ) for the cases of @xmath105 and @xmath18 . \n obviously , scalar torsion cosmology can avoid some of the problems which occur in other models . \n if we refuse the possibility of non - positivity of the kinetic energy , we will employ normal assumption , i. e. , @xmath17 . in this case , \n the effect of torsion can make the expansion rate oscillate . \n with suitable adjustments of the torsion parameters , it is possible to change the quasi - period of the expansion rate as well as its amplitudes . \n it is worth noting that the true values of the statefinder parameters of the universe should be determined in model - independent way . in principle \n , @xmath106 can be extracted from some future astronomical observations , especially the snap - type experiment . \n why there are new features for the statefinder diagnostic of torsion cosmology ? why the torsion parameter @xmath0 is divided into differential ranges by the statefinder \n answer is very simple . \n in fact , the statefinder diagnostic has a direct bearing on the attractor of cosmological dynamics . \n therefore , we will discuss the dynamic analysis in next section . \n eqs . ( [ dth])-([dtr ] ) is an autonomous system , so we can use the qualitative method of ordinary differential equations . \n critical points are always exact constant solutions in the context of autonomous dynamical systems . \n these points are often the extreme points of the orbits and therefore describe the asymptotic behavior . if the solutions interpolate between critical points they can be divided into a heteroclinic orbit and a homoclinic orbit ( a closed loop ) . \n the heteroclinic orbit connects two different critical points and homoclinic orbit is an orbit connecting a critical point to itself . in the dynamical analysis of cosmology , \n the heteroclinic orbit is more interesting @xcite . \n if the numerical calculation is associated with the critical points , then we will find all kinds of heteroclinic orbits .    according to equations ( [ dth])-([dtr ] ) , \n we can obtain the critical points and study the stability of these points . substituting linear perturbations @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 near the critical points into three independent equations , to the first orders in the perturbations , \n gives the evolution of the linear perturbations , from which we could yield three eigenvalues . \n stability requires the real part of all eigenvalues to be negative . \n there are five critical points @xmath110 of the system as follows @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 . \n the corresponding eigenvalues of the critical points ( i)-(v ) are @xmath115    using eq . \n ( [ criticalpoints ] ) , we find that there is only a critical point @xmath116 in the case of @xmath76 . from eq . \n ( [ eigenvalues ] ) , the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath117 , so @xmath118 is an asymptotically stable focus . if we consider the linearized equations , then eqs . \n ( [ dth])-([dtr ] ) are reduced to @xmath119 + the linearized system ( [ dthphirlinear ] ) has an exact periodic solution @xmath120 where @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are initial values . obviously , @xmath127 is a critical line of center for the linearized eqs . \n ( [ hrphips ] ) . in other words \n , there are only exact periodic solutions for the linearized system , but there are quasi - periodic solutions near the focus for the coupled nonlinear equations . \n this property of quasi - periodic also appears in the statefinder diagnostic with the case of @xmath76 . \n @l*15@l critical points & property & @xmath128 & stability + ( ` i ` ) & saddle & @xmath129 & unstable + ( ` ii`)&positive attractor&-1&stable + ( ` iii ` ) & negative attractor&-1&unstable + ( ` iv ` ) & saddle&-1&unstable + ( ` v ` ) & saddle&-1&unstable +    @l*15@l critical points & property & @xmath128 & stability + ( ` i ` ) & focus & @xmath130 & stable + ( ` ii`)&saddle&-1&unstable + ( ` iii ` ) & saddle&-1&unstable + ( ` iv ` ) & saddle&-1&unstable + ( ` v ` ) & saddle&-1&unstable +    in the case of @xmath131 , the critical point ( ii ) is a late time de sitter attractor and ( iii ) is a negative attractor . the properties of the critical points are shown in table [ cripointsa1l0 ] . \n the de sitter attractor indicates that torsion cosmology is an elegant scheme and the scalar torsion mode is an interesting geometric quantity for physics . in the dynamical analysis of cosmology , \n the heteroclinic orbit is more interesting . using numerical calculation \n , we plot the heteroclinic orbit connects the critical point case ( iii ) to case ( ii ) in fig . \n [ heteroclinicorbit ] . \n this heteroclinic orbit is just corresponding to the loop in fig . \n [ planecase3 ] , which is from @xmath69cdm point to @xmath69cdm point . \n furthermore , the trajectories with the shape of tadpole correspond to saddles .     with @xmath132 . \n the heteroclinic orbit connects the critical points case ( iii ) to case ( ii ) . \n we take @xmath133.,width=321 ]     with @xmath94 . \n we take @xmath134 and the initial value @xmath135 . \n @xmath136 is an asymptotically stable focus point.,width=321 ]    in the case of @xmath96 , there is only an unstable saddle @xmath116 where the effective equation of state @xmath128 tends to @xmath129 . \n therefore , the trajectories in fig . \n [ planecase2 ] show that @xmath99,@xmath100 and @xmath101 become larger and larger , then less and less as time increases .    in the case of @xmath18 , \n the properties of the critical points are shown in table [ cripointsa1l-1 ] . \n the trajectories correspond to the stable focus ( see fig . \n 6 ) and unstable saddles with @xmath137 . \n therefore , the trajectories pass through the @xmath69cdm point . \n in ref.@xcite , the authors have compared the numerical values of the torsion model with the observational data , in which they fixed the initial values @xmath48 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , and torsion parameters @xmath0 and @xmath32 . in this section \n , we fixed the initial value , then fit the torsion parameters to current type ia supernovae data . \n the scalar torsion cosmology predict a specific form of the hubble parameter @xmath140 as a function of redshifts @xmath141 in terms of two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath32 when we chose initial values . using the relation between @xmath142 and the comoving distance @xmath143 ( where @xmath141 is the redshift of light emission ) @xmath144 and the light ray geodesic equation in a flat universe @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the scale factor .    in general \n , the approach towards determining the expansion history @xmath140 is to assume an arbitrary ansatz for @xmath140 which is not necessarily physically motivated but is specially designed to give a good fit to the data for @xmath147 . given a particular cosmological model for @xmath148 where @xmath149 are model parameters , the maximum likelihood technique can be used to determine the best fit values of parameters as well as the goodness of the fit of the model to the data . \n the technique can be summarized as follows : the observational data consist of @xmath150 apparent magnitudes @xmath151 and redshifts @xmath152 with their corresponding errors @xmath153 and @xmath154 . \n these errors are assumed to be gaussian and uncorrelated . \n each apparent magnitude @xmath155 is related to the corresponding luminosity distance @xmath156 by @xmath157 + 25,\\ ] ] where @xmath158 is the absolute magnitude . for the distant sneia \n , one can directly observe their apparent magnitude @xmath159 and redshift @xmath141 , because the absolute magnitude @xmath158 of them is assumed to be constant , i.e. , the supernovae are standard candles . obviously , the luminosity distance @xmath147 is the ` meeting point ' between the observed apparent magnitude @xmath160 and the theoretical prediction @xmath140 . \n usually , one define distance modulus @xmath161 and express it in terms of the dimensionless ` hubble - constant free ' luminosity distance @xmath162 defined by@xmath163 as @xmath164 where the zero offset @xmath165 depends on @xmath48 ( or @xmath166 ) as @xmath167 the theoretically predicted value @xmath168 in the context of a given model @xmath169 can be described by @xcite @xmath170 therefore , the best fit values for the torsion parameters ( @xmath171 ) of the model are found by minimizing the quantity @xmath172 ^ 2}{\\sigma_i^2}.\\ ] ] since the nuisance parameter @xmath165 is model - independent , its value from a specific good fit can be used as consistency test of the data @xcite and one can choose _ a priori _ value of it ( equivalently , the value of dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath166 ) or marginalize over it thus obtaining @xmath173 where @xmath174 ^ 2}{\\sigma_i^2},\\ ] ] @xmath175}{\\sigma_i^2},\\ ] ] and @xmath176 in the latter approach , instead of minimizing @xmath177 , one can minimize @xmath178 which is independent of @xmath165 .    the eqs . \n ( [ gradr]-[tort ] ) can be solved explicitly by a series in the form @xmath179,\\ ] ] where @xmath180 and @xmath181 using the general relation between hubble parameter @xmath182 and the redshift @xmath141 , @xmath141 can be written as a function of @xmath50 @xmath183}-1,\\ ] ] however , the convergence radius of the series ( [ e1 ] ) is @xmath184 , so we can use the expansion directly in the case of the redshift being @xmath185 . by the numerical calculation \n , we find that @xmath186 corresponds to @xmath187 for the valuses of parameters @xmath139 and @xmath138 in the fig . \n [ 192clcontours3 ] . for the case of @xmath188 \n , we should use a direct analytic continuation . \n weierstrass @xcite had built the whole theory of analytic functions from the concept of power series . \n given a point @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) , the function @xmath182 has a taylor expansion @xmath191.\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath192 is still expressed as eq . \n ( [ e2 ] ) and @xmath193 can be decided by eq . \n ( [ e1 ] ) . \n the new series defines an analytic function @xmath194 which is said to be obtained from @xmath195 by direct analytic continuation . \n this process can be repeated any number of times . in the general case \n we have to consider a succession of power series @xmath195 , @xmath194, ... ,@xmath196 , each of which is a direct analytic continuation of the preceding one . \n by using this method we have the evolution of hubble parameter @xmath182 . \n furthermore , we have the function @xmath140 from eq . \n ( [ e3 ] ) . \n in fact , we need only to consider the case of @xmath197 for the essence supernovae data . \n we now apply the above described maximum likelihood method using the essence supernovae data which is one of the reliable published data set consisting of 192 sneia ( @xmath198 ) . beside the 162 data points given in table 9 of ref . \n @xcite , which contains 60 essence sneia , 57 snls sneia and 45 nearby sneia , we add 30 sneia detected at @xmath199 by the hubble space telescope @xcite as in ref.@xcite .    in table \n [ differentvalues ] , we show the best fit of torsion parameters at different initial values of @xmath139 and @xmath138 .    @l*15@l @xmath139 & @xmath138 & @xmath0 & @xmath32 + 0.25&0.35 & -0.10&1.44 + 0.20&0.34 & -0.08&1.80 + 0.15&0.34 & -0.06&2.40 + 0.10&0.33 & -0.04&3.60 +    in fig . \n [ 192clcontours3 ] , contours with 68.3% , 95.4% and 99.7% confidence level are plotted , in which we take a marginalization over the model - independent parameter @xmath165 . the best fit as showed in the figure corresponds to @xmath200 and @xmath201 , and the minimum value of @xmath202 . for @xmath203 \n , one can get @xmath204 and the best fit @xmath205 . \n therefore , it s easy to know that @xmath206 is consistent at the @xmath207 level with the best fits of scalar torsion cosmology . in fig . \n [ zu ] , we show a comparison of the essence supernovae data along with the theoretically predicted curves in the context of scalar torsion and @xmath206 . \n we can see that the scalar torsion model(@xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 ) gives a close curve behavior to the one from @xmath206 ( @xmath212 ) . \n clearly , the allowed ranges of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath32 favor the case of @xmath213 if we chose @xmath214 and @xmath215 .     with the essence supernovae data via the relation between the redshift @xmath141 and the distance modulus @xmath54 . \n the scalar torsion model(@xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 ) gives a close curve behavior to the one from @xmath206 ( @xmath212).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   with the essence supernovae data via the relation between the redshift @xmath141 and the distance modulus @xmath54 . \n the scalar torsion model(@xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 ) gives a close curve behavior to the one from @xmath206 ( @xmath212).,title=\"fig:\",width=272 ]     and @xmath32 using the essence sneia dataset . \n here we have assumed @xmath216 , @xmath214 and @xmath215.,width=321 ] \n we have studied the statefinder diagnostic to the torsion cosmology , in which an accounting for the accelerated universe is considered in term of a riemann - cartan geometry : dynamic scalar torsion . \n we have shown that statefinder diagnostic has a direct bearing on the critical points . \n the statefinder diagnostic divides the torsion parameter @xmath0 into four ranges , which is in keeping with the requirement of dynamical analysis . \n therefore , the statefinder diagnostic can be used to an exceedingly general category of models including several for which the notion of equation of state is not directly applicable . \n the statefinder diagnostic has the advantage over the dynamical analysis at the simplicity , but the latter can provide more information . \n the most interesting characteristic of the trajectories is that there is a loop in the case of @xmath217 . \n this behavior corresponds to the heteroclinic orbit connecting the negative attractor and de sitter attractor . \n the trajectories with the shape of tadpole show that they pass through the @xmath69cdm fixed point along the time evolution , then the statefinder pairs are going along with a loop and they will pass through the @xmath69cdm fixed point again in the future . \n it is worth noting that there exists closed loop in the ref . \n @xcite , but there is no closed loop which contains the @xmath69cdm fixed point . \n these behaviors indicate that torsion cosmology is an elegant scheme and the scalar torsion mode is an interesting geometric quantity for physics . \n furthermore , the quasi - periodic feature of trajectories in the cases of @xmath76 or @xmath18 shows that the numerical solutions in ref . \n @xcite are not periodic , but are quasi - periodic near the focus for the coupled nonlinear equations . \n we fixed only the initial values , then fitted the torsion parameters to current sneia dataset . \n we find that the scalar torsion naturally explain the accelerating expansion of the universe for any torsion parameter @xmath0 . \n however , it is dependent @xmath0 and @xmath32 that there is a decelerating expansion before an accelerating expansion . \n the statefinder diagnostics show that the universe naturally have an accelerating expansion at late time and a decelerating expansion at early time for the case of @xmath218 and @xmath18 . \n if we refuse the possibility of non - positivity of the kinetic energy , we have to employ normal assumption ( @xmath17 ) . under this assumption , \n the effect of torsion can make the expansion rate oscillate . \n furthermore , with suitable adjustments of the torsion parameters and initial value , it is possible to change the quasi - period of expansion rate as well as its amplitudes . in order to have a quantitative understanding of the scalar torsion cosmology , the matter density @xmath219 , the effective mass density @xmath220 , and the quantity @xmath221 are important . \n this scenario bears a strong resemblance to the braneworld cosmology in a very different context by sahni , shtanov and viznyuk @xcite . \n the @xmath222 parameters in the torsion cosmology and in the @xmath69cdm cosmology can nevertheless be quite different . \n therefore , at high redshift , the torsion cosmology asymptotically expands like a matter - dominated universe with the value of @xmath222 inferred from the observations of the local matter density . at low redshift \n , the torsion model behaves like @xmath69cdm but with a renormalized value of @xmath223 . \n the difference between @xmath222 and @xmath223 is dependent on the present value of statefinder parameters @xmath224 . \n a more detailed estimate , however , lies beyond the scope of the present paper , and we will study it in a future work . finally , @xmath225 and @xmath226 should be extracted from some future astronomical observations in principle , especially the snap - type experiments . \n this work is supported by national science foundation of china grant no . \n 10847153 and no . 10671128 \n 10 sahni v and starobinsky a 2000 _ int . \n _ d*9 * 373 [ astro - ph/9904398 ] + peebles p j e and ratra b 2003 _ rev . \n phys . _ * 75 * 559 [ astro -

        "article": "developments are currently underway to promote the sensitivity of ligo and to improve its prospect for detecting gravitational waves emitted by compact object binaries @xcite . of particular interest \n are the detection of gravitational waves released during the inspiral and merger of binary black hole ( bbh ) systems . \n detection rates for bbh events are expected to be within 0.41000 per year with advanced ligo @xcite . \n it is important that rigorous detection algorithms be in place in order to maximize the number of detections of gravitational wave signals . \n the detection pipeline currently employed by ligo involves a matched - filtering process whereby signals are compared to a pre - constructed template bank of gravitational waveforms . the templates are chosen to cover some interesting region of mass - spin parameter space and are placed throughout it in such a way that guarantees some minimal match between any arbitrary point in parameter space and its closest neighbouring template . \n unfortunately , the template placement strategy generally requires many thousands of templates ( e.g.  @xcite ) evaluated at arbitrary mass and spin ; something that can not be achieved using the current set of numerical relativity ( nr ) waveforms .    to circumvent this issue \n , ligo exploits the use of analytical waveform families like phenomenological models @xcite or effective - one - body models @xcite . \n we shall focus here on the phenomenological b ( phenomb ) waveforms developed by @xcite . \n this waveform family describes bbh systems with varying masses and aligned - spin magnitudes ( i.e.  non - precessing binaries ) . \n the family was constructed by fitting a parameterized model to existing nr waveforms in order to generate a full inspiral - merger - ringdown ( imr ) description as a function of mass and spin . \n the obvious appeal of the phenomb family is that it allows for the inexpensive construction of gravitational waveforms at arbitrary points in parameter space and can thus be used to create arbitrarily dense template banks .    to optimize computational efficiency of the detection process \n it is desirable to reduce the number of templates under consideration . \n a variety of reduced bases techniques have been developed , either through singular - value decomposition ( svd ) @xcite , or via a greedy algorithm @xcite . \n svd is an algebraic manipulation that transforms template waveforms into an orthonormal basis with a prescription that simultaneously filters out any redundancies existing within the original bank . as a result \n , the number of templates required for matched - filtering can be significantly reduced . in addition \n , it has been shown in @xcite that , upon projecting template waveforms onto the orthonormal basis produced by the svd , interpolating the projection coefficients provides accurate approximations of other imr waveforms not included in the original template bank .    in this paper , we continue to explore the use of the interpolation of projection coefficients . we take a novel approach that utilizes both the analytic phenomb waveform family @xcite and nr hybrid waveforms @xcite . \n we apply svd to a template bank constructed from an analytical waveform family to construct an orthonormal basis spanning the waveforms , then project the nr waveforms onto this basis and interpolate the projection coefficients to allow arbitrary waveforms to be constructed , thereby obtaining a new waveform approximant . \n we show here that this approach improves upon the accuracy of the original analytical waveform family . \n the original waveform family shows mismatches with the nr waveforms as high as @xmath0 when no extremization over physical parameters is applied ( i.e. , a measure of the  faithfulness \" of the waveform approximant ) , and mismatches of @xmath1 when maximized over total mass ( i.e. , a measure of the  effectualness \" of the waveform approximant ) . with our svd accuracy booster \n , we are able to construct a new waveform family ( given numerically ) with mismatches @xmath2 even without extremization over physical parameters . \n this paper is organized as follows . \n we begin in section [ sec : mbias ] where we provide definitions to important terminology used in our paper . \n we then compare our nr hybrid waveforms to the phenomb family and show that a mass - bias exists between the two . in section [ sec : method ] \n we present our svd accuracy booster applied to the case study of equal - mass , zero - spin binaries . in section [ sec:2d ] \n we investigate the feasibility of extending this approach to include unequal - mass binaries . we finish with concluding remarks in section [ sec : discussion ] . \n a gravitational waveform is described through a complex function , @xmath3 , where real and imaginary parts store the sine and cosine components of the wave . \n the specific form of @xmath4 depends on the parameters of the system , in our case the total mass @xmath5 and the mass - ratio @xmath6 . \n while @xmath4 is a continuous function of time , we discretize by sampling @xmath7 , where the sampling times @xmath8 have uniform spacing @xmath9 . \n we shall also whiten any gravitational waveform @xmath4 . \n this processes is carried out in frequency space via @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ligo noise curve and @xmath12 is the fourier transform of @xmath4 . \n the whitened time - domain waveform , @xmath13 , is obtained by taking the inverse fourier transform of . in the remainder of the paper \n , we shall always refer to whitened waveforms , dropping the subscript `` w '' . for our purposes \n it suffices to take @xmath11 to be the initial ligo noise curve . using the advanced ligo noise curve \n would only serve to needlessly complicate our approach by making waveforms longer in the low frequency domain .    as a measure of the level of agreement between two waveforms , @xmath4 and @xmath14 \n , we will use their match , or overlap , @xmath15  @xcite . \n we define @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the standard complex inner product and the norm @xmath18 . \n we always consider the overlap maximized over time- and phase - shifts between the two waveforms . \n the time - maximization is indicated in , and the phase - maximization is an automatic consequence of the modulus . \n note that @xmath19 . for discrete sampling at points \n @xmath20 we have that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the complex conjugate of @xmath14 . without whitening , would need to be evaluated in the frequency domain with a weighting factor @xmath23 . \n the primary advantage of is its compatibility with formal results for the svd , which will allow us to make more precise statements below . \n when maximizing over time - shifts @xmath24 , we ordinarily consider discrete time - shifts in integer multiples of @xmath25 , as this avoids interpolation . \n after the overlap has been maximized , it is useful to speak in terms of the mismatch , @xmath26 , defined simply as @xmath27 we use this quantity throughout the paper to measure the level of disagreement between waveforms . \n we use numerical waveforms computed with the spectral einstein code spec @xcite . \n primarily , we use the 15-orbit equal - mass ( mass - ratio @xmath28 ) , zero - spin ( effective spin @xmath29 ) waveform described in @xcite . in section [ sec:2d ] , we also use unequal mass waveforms computed by @xcite . \n the waveforms are hybridized with a taylort3 post - newtonian ( pn ) waveform as described in @xcite at matching frequencies @xmath30 and @xmath31 for mass - ratios @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . \n taylort4 at 3.5pn order is known to match nr simulations exceedingly well for equal - mass , zero - spin bbh systems  @xcite ( see also fig .  9 of  @xcite ) . \n for @xmath34 , a taylort3 hybrid is very similar to a taylort4 hybrid , cf.figure 12 of @xcite . \n the mismatch between taylort3 and taylort4 hybrids is below @xmath35 at @xmath36 , dropping to below @xmath37 for @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for @xmath40 . \n these mismatches are significantly smaller than mismatches arising in the study presented here , so we conclude that our results are not influenced by the accuracy of the utilized @xmath28 pn - nr hybrid waveform . for higher mass - ratios , \n the pn - nr hybrids have a larger error due to the post - newtonian waveform  @xcite . \n the error - bound on the hybrids increases with mass - ratio , however , is mitigated in our study here , because we use the @xmath41 hybrids only for total mass of @xmath42 , where less of the post - newtonian waveform is in band . \n because nr simulations are not available for arbitrary mass ratios , we will primarily concentrate our investigation to the equal - mass and zero - spin nr hybrid waveforms described above . \n the full imr waveform can be generated at any point along the @xmath43 line through a simple rescaling of amplitude and phase with total mass @xmath44 of the system . \n despite such a simple rescaling , the @xmath43 line lies orthogonal to lines of constant chirp mass @xcite , therefore tracing a steep gradient in terms of waveform overlap , and encompassing a large degree of waveform structure . \n since our procedure for constructing an orthonormal basis begins with phenomb waveforms , let us now investigate how well these waveforms model the nr waveforms to be interpolated . for this purpose , we adopt the notation @xmath45 and @xmath46 to represent nr and phenomb waveforms of total mass @xmath44 , respectively . \n we quantify the faithfulness of the phenomb family by computing the mismatch @xmath47 $ ] as a function of mass . \n the result of this calculation for @xmath48 is shown as the dashed curve in the top panel of figure [ figure : bias ] . \n the mismatch starts off rather high with @xmath49 at @xmath50 and then slowly decreases as the mass is increased , until eventually flattening to @xmath51 at high mass . \n the mismatch between nr and phenomb waveforms can be reduced by optimizing over a mass - bias . \n this is accomplished by searching for the mass @xmath52 for which the mismatch @xmath53 $ ] is a minimum . \n the result of this process is shown by the solid line in the top panel of figure [ figure : bias ] . allowing for a mass bias significantly \n reduces the mismatch for @xmath54 . \n the mass @xmath55 that minimizes mismatch is generally smaller than the mass @xmath44 of our nr `` signal '' waveform , @xmath56 over almost all of the mass range considered . \n apparently , phenomb waveforms are systematically underestimating the mass of the `` true '' nr waveforms , at least along the portion of parameter space considered here . the solid line in the bottom panel of figure [ figure : bias ] plots the relative mass - bias , @xmath57 . \n at @xmath50 this value is @xmath58 , and it rises to just above @xmath59 for @xmath60 . and @xmath29 . a more comprehensive minimization over mass , mass ratio , and effective spin might change this result . ] \n it is useful to consider how this mass bias compares to the potential parameter estimation accuracy in an early detection . for a signal with a matched - filter signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of 8 \n characteristic of early detection scenarios  template / waveform mismatches will influence parameter estimation when the mismatch is @xmath61 @xcite . placing a horizontal cut on the top panel of figure  [ figure : bias ] at @xmath62 , we see that for @xmath63 phenomb waveform errors have no observational consequence ; for @xmath64 a phenomb waveform with the wrong mass will be the best match for the signal . for @xmath65 the missmatch between equal - mass phenomb waveforms and nr ( when optimizing over mass ) \n grows to @xmath66 . \n optimization over mass - ratio will reduce this mismatch , but we have not investigated to what degree . \n we aim to construct an orthonormal basis via the svd of a bank of phenomb template waveforms , and then interpolate the coefficients of nr waveforms projected onto this basis to generate a waveform family with improved nr faithfulness . \n the first step is to construct a template bank of phenomb waveforms , with attention restricted to equal - mass , zero - spin binaries . \n an advantage of focusing on the @xmath43 line is that template bank construction can be simplified by systematically arranging templates in ascending order by total mass .    with this arrangement \n we define a template bank to consist of @xmath67 phenomb waveforms , labelled @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , with @xmath70 and with adjacent templates satisfying the relation : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the desired overlap between templates and @xmath73 is some accepted tolerance in this value . \n the template bank is initiated by choosing a lower mass bound @xmath74 and assigning @xmath75 . \n successive templates are found by sequentially moving toward higher mass in order to find waveforms satisfying until some maximum mass @xmath76 is reached . throughout each trial , overlap between waveforms \n is maximized continuously over phase shifts and discretely over time shifts . for template bank construction \n we choose to refine the optimization over time by considering shifts in integer multiples of @xmath77 . \n we henceforth refer to our fiducial template bank which employs the parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . the lower mass bound \n was chosen in order to obtain a reasonably sized template bank containing @xmath82 waveforms ; pushing downward to @xmath50 results in more than doubling the number of templates . \n template waveforms each have a duration of @xmath83 and are uniformly sampled at @xmath84 ( a sample frequency of @xmath85 ) . \n @xmath86 of memory is required to store this template bank using double - precision waveforms . \n the next step is to transform the template waveforms into an orthonormal basis . \n following the presentation in @xcite , this is achieved by arranging the templates into the rows of a matrix @xmath87 and factoring through svd to obtain @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are orthogonal matrices and @xmath91 is a diagonal matrix whose non - zero elements along the main diagonal are referred to as singular values . \n the svd for @xmath87 is uniquely defined as long as the singular values are arranged in descending order along the main diagonal of @xmath91 . \n the end result of is to convert the @xmath67 complex - valued templates into @xmath92 real - valued orthonormal basis waveforms . \n the @xmath93 basis waveform , @xmath94 , is stored in the @xmath93 row of @xmath89 , and associated with this mode is the singular value , @xmath95 , taken from the @xmath93 element along the main diagonal of @xmath91 . \n one of the appeals of svd is that the singular values rank the basis waveforms with respect to their ability to represent the original templates . \n this can be exploited in order to construct a reduced basis that spans the space of template waveforms to some tolerated mismatch . \n for instance , suppose we choose to reduce the basis by considering only the first @xmath96 basis modes while discarding the rest . \n template waveforms can be represented in this reduced basis by expanding them as the sum @xmath97 where @xmath98 are the complex - valued projection coefficients , @xmath99 the prime in is used to stress that the reduced basis is generally unable to fully represent the original template . \n we are guaranteed from to completely represent the template . ] \n it was shown in @xcite that the mismatch expected from reducing the basis in this way is @xmath100 given @xmath91 , can be inverted to determine the number of basis waveforms , @xmath101 , required to represent the original templates for some expected mismatch @xmath102 . \n provides a useful estimate to the mismatch in represeting templates from a reduced svd basis . in order to investigate its accuracy , \n however , we should compute the mismatch explicitly for each template waveform . using the orthonormality condition @xmath103 , it is easy to show from that the mismatch between the template and its projection can be expressed in terms of the projection coefficients : @xmath104 this quantity is minimized continuously over phase and discretely over time shifts in integer multiples of @xmath25 . \n choosing @xmath105 , predicts that @xmath106 of the @xmath107 basis waveforms from our fiducial template bank are required to represent the templates to the desired accuracy . in figure \n [ figure : rec ] we compare the expected mismatch of @xmath108 to the actual mismatches computed from for each phenomb waveform in the template bank . the open squares in this plot show that the actual template mismatch has a significant amount of scatter about @xmath102 , \n but averaged over a whole remains well bounded to the expected result . \n the phenomb template waveforms can thus be represented to a high degree from a reasonably reduced svd basis . \n we are of course more interested in determining how well nr waveforms can be represented by the same reduced basis of phenomb waveforms . \n since nr and phenomb waveforms are not equivalent , can not be used to estimate the mismatch obtained when projecting nr waveforms onto the reduced basis . \n we must therefore compute their representation mismatch explicitly . \n a general waveform , @xmath109 , can be represented by the reduced basis in analogy to by expressing it as the sum : @xmath110 where @xmath111 . \n as before , the represented waveform @xmath112 will in general be neither normalized nor equivalent to the original waveform @xmath109 . \n the mismatch between them is @xmath113 where we remind the reader that we always minimize over continuous phase shifts and discrete time shifts of the two waveforms .    in figure [ figure : \n rec ] we use open circles to plot the representation mismatch of nr waveforms evaluated at the same set of masses @xmath114 from which the phenomb template bank was constructed . \n we see that nr waveforms can be represented in the reduced basis with a mismatch less than @xmath35 over most of the template bank boundary . \n this is about a factor of five improvement in what can be achieved by using phenomb waveforms optimized over mass . since nr waveforms were not originally included in the template bank , and because a mass - bias exists between the phenomb waveforms which were included , we can expect that the template locations have no special meaning to nr waveforms . \n this is evident from the thin dashed line which traces the nr representation mismatch for masses evaluated between the discrete templates . \n this line varies smoothly across the considered mass range and exhibits no special features at the template locations . \n this is in contrast to the thin solid line which traces phenomb representation mismatch evaluated between templates . \n in this case , mismatch rises as we move away from one template and subsequently falls back down as the next template is approached . \n the representation tolerance @xmath115 of the svd is a free parameter , which so far , we have constrained to be @xmath116 . \n when this tolerance is varied , we observe the following trends : ( i ) phenomb representation mismatch generally follows @xmath117 ; ( ii ) nr representation mismatch follows @xmath117 at first and then _ saturates _ to a minimum as the representation tolerance is continually reduced . \n these trends are observed in figure [ figure : trun ] where we plot nr and phenomb representation mismatch averaged over the mass boundary of the template bank evaluated both at and between templates . \n the saturation in nr representation mismatch occurs when the reduced basis captures all of the nr waveform structure contained within the phenomb basis . reducing \n the basis further hits a point of diminishing returns as the increased computational cost associated with a larger basis outweighs the benefit of marginally improving nr match . \n we now wish to examine the possibility of using the reduced svd basis of phenomb template waveforms to construct a new waveform family with improved nr representation . \n the new waveform family would be given by a numerical interpolation of the projection coefficients of nr waveforms expanded onto the reduced basis . \n here we test this using the fiducial template bank and reduced basis described above . \n the approach is to sample nr projection coefficients , @xmath118 , at some set of locations , @xmath119 , and then perform an interpolation to obtain the continuous function @xmath120 that can be evaluated for arbitrary @xmath121 . \n the accuracy of the interpolation scheme is maximized by finding the space for which @xmath118 are smooth functions of @xmath121 . \n it is reasonable to suppose that the projection coefficients will vary on a similar scale over which the waveforms themselves vary . \n hence , a suitable space to sample along is the space of constant waveform overlap . \n we define this to be the space @xmath122 $ ] for which the physical template masses are mapped according to : @xmath123 moving a distance @xmath124 in this space is thus equivalent to moving a distance equal to the overlap between adjacent templates .    in this space \n , we find the real and imaginary components , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , of the complex projection coefficients to be oscillatory functions that can roughly be described by a single frequency . \n this behaviour is plotted for the basis modes @xmath127 , 50 , and 123 in figure [ figure : interpcoeff ] . \n another trend observed in this plot is that the projection coefficients become increasingly complex ( i.e.  show less structure ) for higher - order modes . \n this is a direct result of the increasing complexity of higher - order basis waveforms themselves . \n we find that the low - order waveforms are smoothest while the high - order modes feature many of the irregularities associated with the multiple frequency components and merger features of the templates . \n though they are more complex , higher - order modes have smaller singular values and are therefore less important in representing waveforms . \n this is evident from the steady decline in amplitude of the projection coefficients when moving down the different panels of figure [ figure : interpcoeff ] . \n we shall use chebyshev polynomials to interpolate the projection coefficients . \n these are a set of orthogonal functions where the @xmath128 chebyshev polynomial is defined as @xmath129 . \n \\label{eq : chebyn } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the orthogonality of chebyshev polynomials can be exploited to perform an @xmath130 order chebyshev interpolation by sampling @xmath131 at the @xmath132 so - called collocation points given by the gauss - lobatto chebyshev nodes @xcite @xmath133 for @xmath134 . \n in general , the interpolation will not be exact and some residual , @xmath135 , will be introduced : @xmath136 here @xmath137 is the actual coefficient of @xmath45 projected onto the basis waveform @xmath94 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the coefficient obtained after interpolation . \n the new waveform family is expressed numerically as a function of mass through the relation @xmath140{\\bf u}_k,\\ ] ] where the subscript \n intp \" reminds the reader that this is computed from an interpolation over @xmath98 . \n an interpolated waveform of total mass @xmath44 can be compared to the original nr waveform ( which we consider to be the  true \" signal ) , where the latter is expressed as @xmath141 with @xmath142 denoting the component of @xmath45 that is orthogonal to the svd basis ( i.e.  orthogonal to all phenomb waveforms in the template bank ) . \n @xmath45 differs from @xmath143 by an amount @xmath144    to compute the impact of the various approximations influencing , we calculate the overlap between the interpolated waveform , and the exact waveform , @xmath145 $ ] . to begin this calculation , \n it is useful to consider the square of the overlap , @xmath146 where we have dropped the explicit mass - dependence and subscripts for convenience . using @xmath147 and taylor - expanding the right - hand - side of to second order in @xmath148 , we find @xmath149 to second order in @xmath148 , the mismatch is therefore @xmath150 we note that the right - hand - side of can be written as @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the part of @xmath148 orthogonal to @xmath109 , @xmath153 however , for simplicity , we proceed by dropping the last term in : @xmath154 using , this gives @xmath155 \\le \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^{n ' } \\left|r_k(m)\\right|^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k = n'+1}^{2n}\\left|\\mu_k(m)\\right|^2 + \\frac{1}{2}|{\\bf h}_\\perp|^2 \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we thus see three contributions to the total mismatch : ( i ) the interpolation error , @xmath156 ; ( ii ) the truncation error from the discarded waveforms of the reduced basis , @xmath157 ; ( iii ) the failure of the svd basis to represent the nr waveform , @xmath158 . \n the sum of the last two terms , which together make up the representation error , is traced by the dashed line in figure [ figure : rec ] . \n the goal for our new waveform family is to have an interpolation error that is negligible compared to the representation error .    to remove the mass - dependence of interpolation error in , \n we introduce the maximum interpolation error of each mode , @xmath159 this allows the bound @xmath160 to place an upper limit on the error introduced by interpolation . \n figure [ figure : rk ] plots @xmath161 as a function of mode - number @xmath162 as well as the cumulative sum @xmath163 . \n the data pertains to an interpolation performed using @xmath164 chebyshev polynomials on the reduced svd basis containing the frist @xmath106 of @xmath107 waveforms . in this case , we find the interpolation error to be largely dominated by the lowest - order modes and also partially by the highest - order modes . \n interpolated coefficients for various modes are plotted in figure [ figure : interpcoeff ] and help to explain the features seen in figure [ figure : rk ] . in the first place , interpolation becomes increasingly more difficult for higher - order modes due to their increasing complexity . \n this problem is mitigated by the fact that high - order modes are less important for representing waveforms , as evidenced by the diminishing amplitude of projection coefficients . \n although low - order modes are much smoother and thus easier to interpolate , their amplitudes are considerably larger meaning that interpolation errors are amplified with respect to high - order modes \n .    summarizes the three components adding to the final mismatch of our interpolated waveform family . \n their total contribution can be computed directly from the interpolated coefficients in a manner similar to : @xmath165 = 1 - \\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^{n^\\prime } \\mu_k^\\prime(m ) \\mu_k^{\\prime^*}(m)}. \\label{eq : interpolationmismatch3}\\ ] ] in the case of perfect interpolation for which @xmath166 , and reduce to and respectively , and the total mismatch is simply the representation error of the reduced basis .    in figure \n [ figure : interperror ] open circles show the total mismatch between our interpolated waveform family and the true nr waveforms for various masses . also plotted is the nr representation error without interpolation and the mismatch between nr and phenomb waveforms minimized over mass . \n we see that interpolation introduces only small additional mismatch to the interpolated waveform family , and remains well below the optimized nr - phenomb mismatch . \n this demonstrates the efficacy of using svd coupled to nr waveforms to generate a _ faithful _ waveform family with improved accuracy over the _ \n phenomb family that was originally used to create templates . \n this represents a general scheme for improving phenomenological models and presents an interesting new opportunity to enhance the matched - filtering process employed by ligo . \n so far , we have focused on the total mass axis of parameter space . \n as already discussed , this served as a convenient model - problem , because the @xmath28 nr waveform can be rescaled to any total mass , so that we are able to compare against the `` correct '' answer . \n the natural extension of this work is to expand into higher dimensions where nr waveforms are available only at certain , discrete mass - ratios @xmath167 . in this section \n we consider expanding our approach of interpolating nr projection coefficients from a two - dimensional template bank containing unequal - mass waveforms . \n we compute a template bank of phenomb waveforms covering mass - ratios @xmath167 from 1 to 6 and total masses @xmath168 . \n this mass range is chosen to facilitate comparison with previous work done by @xcite . \n for the two - dimensional case the construction of a template bank is no longer as straightforward as before due to the additional degree of freedom associated with varying @xmath167 . \n one method that has been advanced for this purpose is to place templates hexagonally on the waveform manifold @xcite . using this procedure we find @xmath169 templates are required to satisfy a minimal match of 0.97 .    following the waveform preparation of @xcite , \n templates are placed in the rows of a matrix @xmath87 with real and imaginary components filled in alternating fashion where the whitened waveforms are arranged in such a way that their peak amplitudes are aligned . \n the waveforms are sampled for a total duration of @xmath170 with uniform spacing @xmath9 so that @xmath171 of memory is required to store the contents of @xmath87 if double precision is desired . \n application of transforms the 16 complex - valued waveforms into 32 real - valued orthonormal basis waveforms . \n the aim is to sample the coefficients of nr waveforms projected onto the svd basis of phenomb waveforms using mass - ratios for which nr data exists , and then interpolate amongst these to construct a numerical waveform family that can be evaluated for arbitrary parameters . \n this provides a method for evaluating full imr waveforms for mass - ratios that have presently not been simulated . to summarize , we take some nr waveform , @xmath172 , or total mass @xmath44 and mass - ratio @xmath167 , and project it onto the basis waveform @xmath94 in order to obtain @xmath173 \n next we apply some two - dimensional interpolation scheme on to construct continuous functions @xmath174 that can be evaluated for arbitrary values of @xmath44 and @xmath167 bounded by the regions of the template bank . \n the interpolated waveform family is given numerically by the form : @xmath175    as before , the interpolation process works best if we can develop a scheme for which the projection coefficients are smoothly varying functions of @xmath44 and @xmath167 . \n following the procedure described in @xcite , the complex phase of the first mode is subtracted from all modes : @xmath176}\\mu_k(m , q ) . \n \\label{eq : musmooth}\\ ] ] to motivate why might be useful , let us consider modifying the phenomb waveform family with a parameter - dependent complex phase @xmath177 : @xmath178 when constructing a template bank , or when using a template bank , such a complex phase @xmath177 is irrelevant , because the waveforms are always optimized over a phase - shift . \n however , @xmath177 will appear in the projection coefficients , , @xmath179 therefore , if one had chosen a function @xmath177 with fine - scale structure , this structure would be inherited by the projection coefficients @xmath180 . for traditional uses of waveform \n families the overall complex phase @xmath177 is irrelevant , and therefore , little attention may have been paid to how it varies with parameters @xmath181 . \n the transformation removes the ambiguity inherent in @xmath177 by choosing it such that @xmath182 . \n this choice ties the complex phase to the physical variations of the @xmath183 coefficient , and does therefore eliminate all unphysical phase - variations on finer scales .    in the leftmost panels of figure \n [ figure : coeff2d ] we plot the real part of the smoothed coefficients @xmath184 for phenomb waveforms projected onto the basis modes @xmath185 and @xmath186 . \n the middle panels show the same thing except using the nr waveforms evaluated at the set of mass - ratios @xmath167 = \\{1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 } for which we have simulated waveforms . \n obviously , the refinement along the @xmath167 axis is much finer for the phenomb waveforms since they can be evaluated for arbitrary mass - ratio , whereas we are limited to sampling at only 5 discrete mass - ratios for nr waveforms . for comparison purposes , \n the rightmost panels of figure [ figure : coeff2d ] show the phenomb projection coefficients coarsened to the same set of mass - ratios for which the nr waveforms are restricted to . \n we find the same general behaviour as before that low - order modes display the smoothest structure , while high - order modes exhibit increasing complexity . a plausible interpolation scheme would be to sample @xmath187 for nr waveforms of varying mass for constant mass ratio ( i.e.  as we have done previously ) and then stitch these together across the @xmath167 axis . \n since the projection coefficients in figure [ figure : coeff2d ] show sinusoidal structure they must be sampled with at least the nyquist frequency along both axes . \n however , looking at the middle and rightmost panels it appears as though this is not yet possible given the present set of limited nr waveforms . \n at best the 5 available mass - ratios are just able to sample at the nyquist frequency along the @xmath167 axis for high - order modes . in order to achieve a reasonable interpolation from these projection \n coefficients the current nr data thus needs to be appended with more mass - ratios . \n based on the left panels of figure [ figure : coeff2d ] a suitable choice would be to double the current number of mass - ratios to include @xmath167 = \\{1.5 , 2.5 , 3.5 , 4.5 , 5 , 5.5}. hence , though it is not yet practical to generate an interpolated waveform family using the svd boosting scheme applied to nr waveforms , the possibility remains open as more nr waveforms are generated . \n we have shown that svd can be used to improve the representation of nr waveforms from a phenomb template bank . a reasonably reduced svd basis was able to reduce mismatch by a factor of five compared to phenomb waveforms optimized over mass . \n there was also no mass - bias associated with the svd basis and therefore no optimization over physical parameters required . \n this occurs because svd unifies a range of waveform structure over an extended region of parameter space so that any biases become blended into its basis . \n svd therefore represents a generalized scheme through which phenomenological waveform families can be de - biased and enhanced for use as matched - filter templates . \n we were able to calibrate an svd basis of phenomb templates against nr waveforms in order to construct a new waveform family with improved accuracy . \n this was accomplished by interpolating the coefficients of nr waveforms projected onto the phenomb basis . \n only marginal error was introduced by the interpolation scheme and the new waveform family provided a more faithful representation of the `` true '' nr signal compared to the original phenomb model . \n this was shown explicitly for the case of equal - mass , zero - spin binaries . \n we proceeded to investigate the possibility of extending this approach to phenomb template banks containing unequal - mass waveforms . at present , however , this method is not yet feasible since the current number of mass - ratios covered by nr simulations are unable to sample the projection coefficients with the nyquist frequency . \n this method will improve as more nr waveforms are simulated and should be sufficient if the current sampling rate of mass - ratios were to double . \n we thank ilana macdonald for preparing the hybrid waveforms used in this study . \n kc , jde and hpp gratefully acknowledge the support of the national science and engineering research council of canada , the canada research chairs program , the canadian institute for advanced research , and industry canada and the province of ontario through the ministry of economic development and innovation . \n dk gratefully acknowledges the support of the max planck society .",
        "abstract": "This paper discusses advancements in LIGO's detection capabilities for gravitational waves, particularly from binary black hole mergers. It highlights the use of PhenomB waveforms and numerical relativity (NR) hybrid waveforms in creating efficient template banks for signal detection. The paper details a method using singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce the number of templates and improve computational efficiency. By interpolating projection coefficients, the authors develop a novel waveform family that offers better accuracy compared to traditional analytical models. This method promises enhanced sensitivity in gravitational wave detection and may lead to higher detection rates of cosmic events."

        "article": "in quantum information processing , information is stored and processed with a quantum system . \n a quantum system is always in contact with its surrounding environment , which leads to decoherence in the quantum system . \n decoherence must be suppressed for quantum information stored in qubits to be intact . \n there are several proposals to fight against decoherence . \n quantum error correction , abriviated as qec hereafter , is one of the most promising candidate to suppress environmental noise , which leads to decoherence @xcite . by adding extra ancillary qubits , in analogy with classical error correction , it is possible to encode a data qubit to an @xmath4-qubit codeword in such a way that an error which acted in the error quantum channel is identified by measuring another set of ancillary qubits added for error syndrome readout . \n then the correct codeword is recovered from a codeword suffering from a possible error by applying a recovery operation , whose explicit form is determined by the error syndrome readout . \n in contrast with the conventional scheme outlined in the previous paragraph , there is a scheme in which neither syndrome readouts nor syndrome readout ancilla qubits are required @xcite . in particular , in @xcite , a general efficient scheme was proposed . \n a data qubit is encoded with encoding ancilla qubits by the same encoding circuit as the conventional one , after which a noisy channel is applied on the codeword . \n subsequently , the inverse of the encoding circuit is applied on a codeword , which possibly suffers from an error . \n the resulting state is a tensor product of the data qubit state with a possible error and the ancilla qubit state . \n it is possible to correct erroneous data qubit state by applying correction gates with the ancilla qubits as control qubits and the data qubit as a target qubit . \n this paper presents two examples of error correcting codes falling in the second category . \n the noisy quantum channel is assumed to be fully correlated @xcite , which means all the qubits constituting the codeword are subject to the same error operators . in most physical realizations of a quantum computer , \n the system size is typically on the order of a few micrometers or less , while the environmental noise , such as electromagnetic wave , has a wavelength on the order of a few millimeters or centimeters . \n then it is natural to assume all the qubits in the register suffer from the same error operator . to demonstrate the advantage of the second category , we restrict ourselves within the noise operators @xmath7 in the following , where @xmath3 is the number of constituent qubits in the codeword . \n we show that there exists an @xmath4-qubit encoding which accommodates an @xmath5-qubit data state if @xmath4 is odd and an @xmath6-qubit date state if @xmath4 is even . \n although the channel is somewhat artificial as an error channel , we may apply our error correction scheme in the following situation . \n suppose alice wants to send qubits to bob . \n their qubit bases differ by unitary operations @xmath8 or @xmath9 . \n even when they do not know which basis the other party employs , the can correctly send qubits by adding one extra qubits ( when @xmath4 is odd ) or two extra qubits ( when @xmath4 is even ) .    we state the theorems and prove them in the next section . \n the last section is devoted to summary and discussions . \n in the following , @xmath10 denotes the @xmath11th component of the pauli matrices and we take the basis vectors @xmath12 so that @xmath13 is diagonalized . \n we introduce operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 acting on the @xmath4-qubit space @xmath16 , where @xmath3 as mentioned before . \n let @xmath17 be @xmath18 complex matrices , and let @xmath19 \n . denote by @xmath20 the ( joint ) rank-@xmath21 numerical range of @xmath22 , which is the collection of @xmath23 such that @xmath24 for some @xmath18 rank-@xmath21 orthogonal projection @xmath25 @xcite . a quantum channel of the form @xmath26 has a @xmath21-dimensional quantum error correcting code ( qecc ) if and only if @xmath27 . \n to prove this statement , we need to recall the knill - laflamme correctability condition , which asserts that given a quantum channel @xmath28 with error operators @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a qecc of @xmath31 if and only if @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the projection operator with the range space @xmath30 @xcite . \n it should be clear that @xmath34 if and only if there is a qecc with dimension @xmath21 . \n now it follows from @xmath35 and the relations @xmath36 when @xmath4 is even and @xmath37 when @xmath4 is odd that the channel ( [ eq : corrch ] ) has a @xmath21-dimensional qecc if and only if @xmath38 by noting that @xmath39 irrespective of rank  @xmath25 , we find @xmath40 if and only if @xmath41 . \n [ thm1 ] suppose @xmath3 is odd \n . then @xmath42 . \n our proof is constructive . \n for @xmath43 , denote @xmath44 . \n let @xmath45 then @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the number of @xmath48-combinations from @xmath4 elements . \n since @xmath49 we have @xmath50 let @xmath25 be the orthogonal projection onto @xmath30 . \n then the above observation shows that @xmath51 and @xmath52 . \n therefore , @xmath53 , which shows that @xmath54 and hence @xmath30 is shown to be a @xmath55-dimensional qecc . \n _    now let us turn to the even @xmath4 case . \n we first state a lemma which is necessary to prove the theorem . \n [ lem1 ] let @xmath56 be a normal matrix . \n then the rank-@xmath21 numerical range of @xmath57 is the intersection of the convex hulls of any @xmath58 eigenvalues of @xmath57 . \n the proof of the lemma is found in @xcite . \n [ thm2 ] suppose @xmath3 is even . then @xmath59 but @xmath60 .    _ proof \n let @xmath61 . by theorem [ thm1 ] , @xmath62 . \n consider @xmath63 observe that the projection @xmath25 onto @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 and @xmath52 and hence @xmath66 , which proves @xmath59 . \n _    since @xmath67 is a commuting family , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be diagonalized simultaneously . \n we may assume that @xmath68 since @xmath69 , we have @xmath70    let us show that @xmath71 . \n we first note the identity @xmath72 for hermitian @xmath73 . \n let us replace @xmath74 by @xmath75 and @xmath76 by @xmath77 to obtain @xmath78 . \n since @xmath75 and @xmath77 commute , @xmath79 is normal and lemma [ lem1 ] is applicable . from eqs . \n ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , we find @xmath79 has eigenvalues @xmath80 and each eigenvalue is @xmath81-fold degenerate . by taking @xmath82 and @xmath83 in lemma [ lem1 ] , we find the rank-@xmath55 numerical range of @xmath79 is the intersection of the convex hulls of any @xmath84 eigenvalues . \n since each eigenvalue has multiplicity @xmath81 , each convex hull involves at least three eigenvalues . by inspecting four eigenvalues plotted in the complex plane \n , we easily find the intersection of all the convex hulls is a single point @xmath85 , which proves @xmath71 . \n similarly , we prove @xmath86 . from these equalities \n we obtain @xmath87 suppose @xmath42 . \n let @xmath25 be a rank-@xmath55 projection such that @xmath88 . \n let @xmath89\\ ] ] where each @xmath90 has size @xmath91 . from @xmath92 and @xmath93 \n , we have four independent equations @xmath94 let @xmath95 be the singular value decomposition of @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is a nonnegative diagonal matrix and @xmath98 . then the above equations are solved as @xmath99 by collecting these results , we find the projection operator is decomposed as @xmath100   \\[\\begin{array}{cc}d&d\\\\   d&d\\end{array}\\]\\[\\begin{array}{cc}u^\\dagger&0\\\\ 0&v^\\dagger\\end{array}\\]\\,.\\ ] ] since rank  @xmath101 and @xmath102 , it follows from @xmath103 that @xmath104 . \n let @xmath105 then both @xmath57 and @xmath106 are non - singular . \n on the other hand , the assumption @xmath107 implies @xmath108 and hence @xmath109 , which is a contradiction . \n therefore , @xmath60 .    in the following , \n we give an explicit construction of qecc for @xmath31 in eq . \n ( [ eq : corrch ] ) with odd @xmath4 . \n the technique is based on theorem [ thm1 ] and the results in @xcite . \n let @xmath110 be the @xmath111 matrix with columns in the set @xmath112    define the @xmath113 matrix @xmath114 $ ] . in our qec , an @xmath5-qubit state @xmath115 is encoded with one ancilla qubit @xmath116 as @xmath117 . \n then a noisy quantum channel @xmath31 is applied on the encoded state and subsequently the recovery operation @xmath118 is applied so that the decoded state automatically appears in the output with no syndrome measurements . \n our qec is concisely summarized as @xmath119 where @xmath120 . \n choosing an encoding amounts to assigning each of @xmath81 column vectors in @xmath110 a basis vector of the whole hilbert space without repetition . \n therefore there are large degrees of freedom in the choice of encoding . in the following examples , \n we have chosen encoding whose quantum circuit can be implemented with the least number of cnot gates . since our decoding circuit is the inverse of the encoding circuit , it is also implemented with the least number of cnot gates .    when @xmath121 , the unitary operation @xmath122 can be chosen as @xmath123 when @xmath124 , @xmath122 can be chosen as @xmath125    figure [ nodd ] shows quantum circuits of the matrix @xmath122 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 . \n [ nodd ]    -qubit state @xmath115 with a single ancilla qubit initially in the state @xmath128 . \n ( a ) is for @xmath126 while ( b ) is for @xmath127 . \n the quantum channel in the box represents a quantum operation with fully correlated noise given in eq . \n the output ancilla state is @xmath129 for error operators @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( @xmath132 and @xmath133 ) for @xmath126 and @xmath129 for @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) for @xmath127.,width=529 ]    it follows from eq . \n ( [ qecc ] ) that the recovery circuit is the inverse of the encoding circuit . \n it seems , at first sight , that the implementations given in fig . \n 1 contradict with eq . \n ( [ qecc ] ) since the controlled not gate in the end of the recovery circuit is missing in the encoding circuit . \n note , however , that the top qubit is set to @xmath138 initially and the controlled not gate is safely omitted without affecting encoding . \n we construct a decoherence - free encoding when @xmath4 is even as follows . \n the codeword in this case is immune to the noise operators , which is an analogue of noiseless subspace / subsystem introduced in @xcite . \n let @xmath139 then evidently a vector @xmath140 is separately invariant under the action of @xmath141 and @xmath9 . \n there are @xmath142 orthogonal vectors of such form , e.g. we have four vectors , @xmath143 for @xmath144 . \n thus we find a decoherence - free encoding for @xmath145 qubits by projecting onto this invariant subspace spanned by these basis . \n it should be noted that the projection operator @xmath25 to the subspace @xmath146 spanned by the four vectors in eq . \n ( [ nss ] ) satisfies rank  @xmath147 and @xmath148 , which shows @xmath149 . \n it is easy to generalize this result to cases with arbitrary @xmath150 . \n figure [ neven ] ( a ) and \n ( b ) depict quantum circuits for ( a ) @xmath144 and ( b ) @xmath151 , respectively . \n [ neven ]    -qubit state @xmath115 with two ancilla qubit initially in the state @xmath152 . \n ( a ) is for @xmath144 while ( b ) is for @xmath151 . \n the quantum channel in the box represents a quantum operation with fully correlated noise given in eq . \n the output ancilla state is always @xmath153 , irrespective of error operators acted in the channel.,width=529 ] \n we have shown that there is a quantum error correction which suppresses fully correlated errors of the form @xmath154 , in which @xmath4 qubits are required to encode ( i ) @xmath155 data qubit states when @xmath4 is odd and ( ii ) @xmath156 data qubit states when @xmath4 is even . \n we have proved these statements by using operator theoretical technique . \n neither syndrome measurements nor ancilla qubits for syndrome measurement are required in our scheme , which makes physical implementation of our scheme highly practical . \n examples with @xmath126 and @xmath127 are analyzed in detail and explicit quantum circuits implementing our qec with the least number of cnot gate were obtained . \n since the error operators are closed under matrix multiplication , errors can be corrected even when they act on the codeword many times . \n a somewhat similar qec has been reported in @xcite . \n they analyzed a partially correlated noise , where the error operators acts on a fixed number of the codeword qubits simultaneously . \n they have shown that the quantum packing bound was violated by taking advantage of degeneracy of the codes . \n justification of such a noise physically , however , seems to be rather difficult . \n they have also shown that correlated noise acting on an arbitrary number @xmath4 of qubits can encode @xmath157 data qubits . \n in contrast , we have analyzed a fully correlated noise , which shows the highest degeneracy , and have shown that @xmath158 data qubits can be encoded with an @xmath4-qubit codeword when @xmath4 is odd . \n clearly , our qec suppressing fully correlated errors is optimal as it is clear that one can not encode @xmath4 qubits as data qubits for odd @xmath4 and we have shown that one can not encode @xmath155 qubits for even @xmath4 . \n ckl was supported by a usa nsf grant , a hk rgc grant , the 2011 fulbright fellowship , and the 2011 shanxi 100 talent program . \n he is an honorary professor of university of hong kong , taiyuan university of technology , and shanghai university . \n mn and ht were supported by `` open research center '' project for private universities : matching fund subsidy from mext ( ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ) . \n ytp was supported by a usa nsf grant . \n nss was supported by a hk rgc grant .",

        "article": "it has become a generally agreed concept that the euv dimming observed during the onset of a _ coronal mass ejection ( cme ) _ manifests the coronal mass loss of the cme , and thus we basically expect a one - to - one correlation between the detections of cmes and euv dimmings , unless there exist special circumstances . for instance , the cme could originate behind the limb , in which case the euv dimming is obscured , or the cme could start in the upper corona , where there is little euv emission because of the gravitational stratification . \n the latter case would imply very low masses compared with a cme that originates at the base of the corona , i.e. , @xmath0 at two thermal scale heights . \n however , there exists a case with an average cme mass that did not leave any footprints behind in euv ( robbrecht et al . \n a statistical study on the simultaneous detection of euv dimmings and cmes has recently been performed by bewsher et al . \n this study based on soho / cds and lasco data confirms a 55% association rate of dimming events with cmes , and vice versa a 84% association rate of cmes with dimming events \n . some of the non - associated events may be subject to occultation , cme detection sensitivity , or incomplete temperature coverage in euv and soft x - rays . \n perhaps the cme - dimming association rate will reach 100% once the stereo spacecraft arrive at a separation of @xmath1 and cover all equatorial latitudes of the sun . \n a number of studies have been carried out by using the detection of coronal dimming to identify cme source regions , focusing on transient coronal holes caused by filament eruptions ( rust 1983 ; watanabe et al . \n 1992 ) , euv dimming at cme onsets ( harrison 1997 ; aschwanden et al . \n 1999 ) , soft x - ray dimming after cmes ( sterling & hudson 1997 ) , soft x - ray dimming after a prominence eruption ( gopalswamy & hanaoka 1998 ) , simultaneous dimming in soft x - rays and euv during cme launches ( zarro et al .  1999 ; harrison & lyons 2000 ; harrison et al . \n 2003 ) , determinations of cme masses from euv dimming from spectroscopic data ( harrison & lyons 2000 ; harrison et al . \n 2003 ) or from euv imaging data ( zhukov and auchere 2004 ; aschwanden et al . \n all these studies support the conclusion that dimmings in the corona ( either detected in euv , soft x - rays , or both ) are unmistakable signatures of cme launches , and thus can be used vice versa to identify the mutual phenomena .    in this study here \n we attempt for the first time to model the kinematics of a cme and the resulting euv dimming quantitatively , which provides us unique physical parameters of the cme source region and on the cme kinematics in the initial acceleration phase . \n the dynamics of a cme can often be characterized by a rapid expansion of a magnetically unstable coronal volume that expands from the lower corona upward into the heliosphere . \n different shapes have been used to approximately describe the 3d geometry of a cme , such as a spherical bubble , an ice - cone , a crescent , or a helical flux rope , which expand in a self - similar fashion and approximately maintain the aspect ratio in vertical and horizontal directions during the initial phase of the expansion . here \n we develop a four - dimensional ( 4d=3d+t ) model that describes the 3d evolution of the cme geometry in time ( t ) in terms of 4d electron density distributions @xmath2 that allow us also to predict and forward - fit a corresponding euv intensity image data cube @xmath3 in an observed wavelength .    for the sake of simplicity \n we start in our model here with the simplest case , assuming : ( 1 ) spherical 3d geometry for the cme front and cavity ; ( 2 ) self - similar expansion in time ; ( 3 ) density compression in the cme front and adiabatic volume expansion in the cme cavity ; ( 4 ) mass conservation for the sum of the cme front , cavity , and external coronal volume ; ( 5 ) hydrostatic ( gravitational stratification ) or super - hydrostatic density scale heights ; ( 6 ) line - tying condition for the magnetic field at the cme base ; and ( 7 ) a magnetic driving force that is constant during the time interval of the initial expansion phase . \n this scenario is consistent with the traditional characterization of a typical cme morphology in three parts , including a cme front ( leading edge ) , a cavity , and a filament ( although we do not model the filament part ) . \n the expanding cme bubble sweeps up the coronal plasma that appears as a bright rim at the observed `` cme front '' or leading edge . \n the interior of the cme bubble exhibits a rapid decrease in electron density due to the adiabatic expansion , which renders the inside of the cme bubble darker in euv and appears as the observed `` cme cavity '' . \n the assumption of adiabatic expansion implies no mass and energy exchange across the outer cme boundary , and thus is consistent with the assumption of a low plasma @xmath4-parameter in the corona with perfect magnetic confinement , while the cme bubble will become leaking in the outer corona and heliosphere , where the plasma @xmath4-parameter exceeds unity ( not included in our model here ) . \n a spherical 3d geometry can be characterized by one single free parameter , the radius @xmath5 of the sphere . \n the self - similar expansion maintains the spherical shape , so the boundary of the cme bubble can still be parameterized by a single time - dependent radius @xmath6 . \n the time - dependence of the cme expansion is controlled by magnetic forces , e.g. , by a lorentz force or hoop force . for sake of simplicity \n we assume a constant force during the initial phase of the cme expansion , which corresponds to a constant acceleration @xmath7 and requires three free parameters ( @xmath8 ) to characterize the radial cme expansion , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the initial radius at starting time @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the initial velocity and @xmath7 is the acceleration of the radial expansion .    for the motion of the cme centroid at height @xmath13 we assume a similar quadratic parameterization , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the initial height at starting time @xmath11 , @xmath16 is the initial velocity and @xmath17 is the acceleration of the vertical motion . \n this parameterization is consistent with a fit to a theoretical mhd simulation of a breakout cme ( lynch et al . \n 2004 ) as well as with kinematic fits to observed cmes ( byrne et al . \n 2009 ) .    , the outer radius of the cme sphere is @xmath6 , and the inner radius of the cme front is @xmath18 . \n these parameters increase quadratically with time . \n the circular footpoint area of the cme with radius @xmath19 stays invariant during the self - similar expansion in order to satisfy the line - tying condition of the coronal magnetic field at the footpoints.,width=313 ]    further we constrain the cme geometry with a cylindrical footpoint area of radius @xmath19 , which connects from the solar surface to the lowest part of the spherical cme bubble . in order to ensure magnetic line - tying at the footpoints , \n the cme bubble should always be located above the cyclidrical footpoint base , which requires that the initial height satisfies @xmath20 and the acceleration constants are @xmath21 . \n we visualize the model geometry in fig . 1 . \n the time - invariant cme footprint area allows us a simple mass estimate of the cme from the cylindrical volume integrated over a vertical scale height , since the spherical cme bubble will eventually move to large heights with no additional mass gain ( at time @xmath22 , see right - hand panel in fig.1 ) .    assuming adiabatic expansion inside the cme cavity , the electron density in the confined plasma decreases reciprocally to the expanding volume , i.e. , @xmath23 so it drops with the third power as a function of time from the initial value @xmath24 ( of the average density inside the cme ) .    for the mass distribution inside the cme \n we distinguish between a compression region at the outer envelope , containing the cme front , and a rarefaction region in the inside , which is also called cme cavity . \n we define an average width @xmath25 of the cme front that is assumed to be approximately constant during the self - similar expansion of the cme . \n while the radius @xmath6 demarcates the outer radius of the cme front , we denote the inner radius of the cme front or the radius of the cavity with @xmath18 , @xmath26 which has an initial value of @xmath27 . \n the total volume @xmath28 of the cme is composed of a spherical volume with radius @xmath6 and the cylindrical volume beneath the cme with a vertical height of @xmath29 , @xmath30 \\ , \\ ] ] which has an initial volume value of @xmath28 , @xmath31 \\ .\\ ] ] the volume of the cme front @xmath32 is essentially the difference between the outer and inner sphere ( neglecting the cylindrical base at the footpoint ) @xmath33 while the volume @xmath34 of the cavity is , @xmath35    we have now to define the time - dependent densities in the cme , for both the cme front , which sweeps up plasma during its expansion , as well as for the cme cavity , which rarifies due to the adiabatic expansion . \n the total mass @xmath36 of the plasma that is swept up from the external corona in a cme corresponds to the total cme volume @xmath37 minus the initial volume of the cme cavity , @xmath38 \\\\          & = m_p < n_e > { 4 \\over 3 } \\pi [ r(t)^3 -

hydrostaticity factor ) @xmath59 that expresses the ratio of the effective density scale height to the hydrostatic scale height at temperature @xmath58 ) . \n the temperature @xmath58 defines the hydrostatic scale height @xmath60 of the corona in the observed temperature range , which enters the definition of the effective density scale height @xmath61 ( e.g. , eq . [ 3.1.16 ] in aschwanden 2004 ) , @xmath62}\\ .\\ ] ] thus , assuming an exponentially stratified atmosphere ( eq . \n 15 ) , a density compression factor @xmath63 in the cme front ( eq . \n 12 ) , and adiabatic expansion inside the cme cavity ( eq . \n 14 ) , we have the following time - dependent 3d density model : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the distance of an arbitrary location with 3d coordinates @xmath66 to the instantaneous center position @xmath67 $ ] of the cme , @xmath68 ^ 2+[y - y_0(t)]^2+[z - z_0(t)]^2 } \\ , \\ ] ] which is located at height @xmath13 vertically above the heliographic position ( @xmath54 ) . \n one cme event observed with stereo that appears as a spherically expanding shell , and thus is most suitable for fitting with our analytical model , is the 2008-mar-25 , 18:30 ut , event . \n this cme occurred near the east limb for spacecraft stereo / ahead , and was observed on the frontside of the solar disk with spacecraft stereo / behind . \n some preliminary analysis of this event regarding cme expansion and euv dimming can be found in aschwanden et al . \n ( 2009a ) , the cme mass was determined in white light with stereo / cor-2 ( colaninno and vourlidas 2009 ) and with stereo / euvi ( aschwanden et al . \n 2009b ) , and the 3d geometry was modeled with forward - fitting of various geometric models to the white - light observations ( thernisien et al . \n 2009 ; temmer et al . \n 2009 ; maloney et al . 2009 ; mierla et al . \n 2009a , b ) . \n while most previous studies model the white - light emission of this cme , typically a few solar radii away from the sun , our model applies directly to the cme source region in the lower corona , as observed in euv . \n we follow the method outlined in aschwanden et al . \n ( 2009a ) . \n our model also quantifies the geometry and kinematics of the cme , as well as the euv dimming associated with the launch of the cme . \n figures 2 and 3 show sequences of 16 ( partial ) euv images , simultaneously observed with stereo / a and b with a cadence of 75 s during the time interval of 18:36 - 18:56 ut on 2008-mar-25 . in order to determine the positional parameters of the cme as a function of time we trace the outer envelope of the cme bubble ( by visual clicking of 3 points ) in each image and each spacecraft and fit a circle through the 3 points in each image . \n the selected points for fitting the position of the cme bubble were generally chosen in the brightest features of the lateral cme flanks , but could not always been traced unambiguously in cases with multiple flank features . in those cases we traced the features that were closest to a continuously expanding solution . \n the radii and y - positions of the circular fits are fully constrained from the stereo / a images , so that only the x - positions of the centroid of the spherical shell need to be fitted in the epipolar stereo / b images . \n we note that the fits of the cme bubble roughly agree with the envelopes of the difference flux in the stereo / b images initially ( up to 18:48 ut ) , while there is a discrepancy later on . \n apparently the cme has a more complex geometry than our spherical bubble model , which needs to be investigated further . \n this procedure yields the cme centroid positions @xmath69 $ ] and @xmath70 $ ] for the time sequence @xmath71 . \n the images in fig . \n 2 and 3 are displayed as a baseline difference ( by subtracting a pre - cme image at 18:36 ut ) to enhance the contrast of the cme edge . \n the circular fits to the cme outer boundaries are overlayed in fig . 2 and 3 . \n both images have been coaligned and rotated into epipolar coordinates ( inhester et al . \n 2006 ) , so that the y - coordinates of a corresponding feature are identical in the spacecraft a and b images , while the x - coordinates differ according to the spacecraft separation angle @xmath72 , which amounts to @xmath73 at the time of the cme event . \n the epipolar coordinates measured from both spacecraft are then related to the heliographic longitude @xmath74 , latitude @xmath75 , and distance @xmath76 from sun center as follows , @xmath77 which can directly be solved to obtain the spherical ( epipolar ) coordinates @xmath78 , @xmath79 ^ 2 }   \\\\      b    = \\arcsin { ( y_a / r_c ) }      \\end{array}\\ ] ] therefore , using stereoscopic triangulation , we can directly determine the spherical coordinates @xmath80 , @xmath81 for all 16 time frames , as well as obtain the cme curvature radii @xmath82 from the circular fits to the cmes . \n we plot the so obtained observables @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath6 , and @xmath85 in fig . 3 and determine our model parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 from the averages . \n we obtain a longitude of @xmath86 ( for spacecraft stereo / a ) , @xmath87 ( for spacecraft stereo / b ) , and a latitude @xmath88 . \n thus , the cme source region is clearly occulted for stereo / a . \n these epipolar coordinates can be rotated into an ecliptic coordinate system by the tilt angle @xmath89 of the spacecraft a / b plane . \n viewed from earth , the longitude is approximately @xmath90 . \n thus , the cme source region is @xmath91 behind the east limb when seen from earth . \n this explains why the euv dimming is seen uncontaminted from post - flare loops , which are seen by stereo / b but hidden for stereo / a . \n ( top panel ) and latitude @xmath84 ( second panel ) of the cme centroid , the radius @xmath6 of the cme sphere ( third panel ) , and cme centroid height @xmath13 ( bottom ) . \n the average values are @xmath92 and @xmath93 for the heliographic position . \n the cme radius @xmath6 and height @xmath13 are fitted with quadratic functions ( dashed curves ) , yielding the constants @xmath94 hrs ( 18:38 ut ) , @xmath95 mm , @xmath96 mm , and accelerations @xmath97 km s@xmath98 and @xmath99 km s@xmath98 ( see eqs \n . 1 - 2).,width=313 ]              we plot also the observables @xmath13 and @xmath6 in fig . 4 and determine the model parameters @xmath55 , @xmath100 , @xmath17 , @xmath7 by fitting the quadratic functions @xmath6 ( eq .  1 ) and @xmath13 ( eq . \n 2 ) , for which we obtain the starting time @xmath94 hrs ( 18:38 ut ) , the initial cme radius @xmath95 mm , the initial height @xmath96 mm , and the accelerations @xmath97 km s@xmath98 for the cme radius expansion , and @xmath99 km s@xmath98 for the height motion . the initial velocity is found to be negligible ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) . \n we estimate the accuracy of the acceleration values to be of order @xmath0 , based on the uncertainty of defining the leading edge of the cme . \n thus , we determined 9 out of the 14 free parameters of our model sofar . \n note that the acceleration measured here refers to the very origin of the cme in low coronal heights of @xmath103 solar radii observed in euvi data . \n the acceleration is expected to be initially high and to rapidly decline further out , when the driving magnetic forces decrease at large altitudes . \n this explains why our values for the acceleration in low coronal heights are significantly higher than measured further out in the heliosphere , typically in the order of tens of m s@xmath104 in height ranges of 5 - 22 solar radii , as measured with soho / lasco . \n soho / lasco reported even a slightly negative acceleration at altitutes of 5 - 22 solar radii . \n the driving magnetic forces that accelerate a cme are clearly confined to much lower altitudes . \n we model the 3d geometry of the cme bubble with the time - dependent radius @xmath6 and the width @xmath25 of the cme compression region . in fig . \n 5 we show cross - sectional euv brightness profiles across the cme in horizontal direction ( parallel to the solar surface ) and in vertical direction for the euvi / a 171   observations ( indicated with dotted lines in fig . \n these baseline - subtracted profiles clearly show a progressive dimming with a propagating bright rim at the cme boundary , which corresponds to the density compression region at the lateral expansion fronts of the cme . \n the bright rims are clearly visible in the images during 18:46@xmath10518:56 ut shown in fig .  2 . \n the average width of the observed bright rims is @xmath106 mm , a value we adopt in our model . \n finally we are left with the four physical parameters @xmath107 , and @xmath47 . \n since we show here only data obtained with the 171 filter , the mean temperature is constrained by the peak temperature of the instrumental euvi response function , which is at @xmath108 mk . \n this constrains the thermal scale height to @xmath109 km . \n the remaining free parameters @xmath59 , @xmath24 , and @xmath47 need to be determined from best - fit solutions by forward - fitting of simulated euv brightness images ( or profiles , as shown in fig . \n 5 ) to observed euv brightness images ( or profiles ) . \n the euv emission measure in each pixel position @xmath110 can be computed by line - of - sight integration along the @xmath111-axis in our 3d density cube @xmath112 per pixel area @xmath113 for each time @xmath114 , @xmath115 from which the intensity @xmath116 in the model image in units of dn s@xmath104 can be directly obtained by multiplying with the instrumental response function @xmath117 of the 171  filter , @xmath118 where @xmath119 dn s@xmath104 @xmath120 mk@xmath104 and the fwhm of the 171 filter is @xmath121 mk .    in fig . \n 6 we show best - fit solutions of horizontal and vertical brightness profiles . the absolute flux level is proportional to the coronal base density squared , which we obtain by minimizing the mean flux difference between simulated and observed flux profiles . \n we obtain a best - fit value of @xmath122 @xmath123 . \n the super - hydrostaticity factor is most sensitive to the vertical flux profile ( fig .   5 , right - hand side panels ) , \n for which we find a best - fit value of @xmath124 . \n thus , the average density scale height in the cme region is slightly super - hydrostatic , as expected for dynamic processes . \n these values are typical for quiet - sun corona and active region conditions ( see figs . 6 and 10 in aschwanden and acton 2001 ) . \n the last free parameter , the maximum density compression factor @xmath47 , affects mostly the brightness of the cme rims . fitting the brightness excess at the cme rims at those times where bright rims are visible are consistent with a value of @xmath125 . \n ll parameter & best -

sectional horizontal and vertical brightness profiles ( fig . \n 5 ) , we are now in the position to inter - compare the numerically simulated images with the observed images , as shown in fig . 6 for 5 selected times , for both the stereo / a and b spacecraft . \n the comparison exhibits a good match for the extent of the dimming region the the bright lateral rims , both extending over about 1.5 thermal scale heights above the solar surface . \n the base - difference images of euvi / a reveal a fairly symmetric cme ( as the model is by design ) , surrounded by spherical bright rims at the northern and southern cme boundaries ( as the model is able to reproduce it ) .    the model , however , is less in agreement with the observed euvi / b images . \n the extent of the euv dimming region matches relatively exactly , although the observed dimming region is somewhat cluttered with bright postflare loops that appear in the aftermath of the cme , which are mostly hidden in the euvi / a observations . \n the biggest discrepancy between the model and the euvi / b observations is the location of the brightest rim of the cme boundary . \n the combination of projection effects and gravitational stratification predict a brighter rim on the west side , where we look through a longer and denser column depth tangentially to the cme bubble , which is not apparent in the observations of euvi / b . instead , there is more bright emission just above the eastern limb that can not be reproduced by the model . \n apparently there exists stronger density compression on the eastern side of the cme bubble than the model predicts . \n another inconsistency is the bright loop seen in euvi / b at 18:51 ut , which does not match the surface of the modeled cme sphere as constrained by euvi / a . \n apparently , there are substantial deviations from a spherically symmetric cme bubble model that are visible in euvi / b but not in euvi / a . perhaps a flux rope model \n could better fit the observations than a spherical shell model . \n these discrepancies between the observations and our simple first - cut model provide specific constraints for a more complex model ( with more free parameters ) that includes inhomogeneities in the density distribution of the cme . \n our model allows us , in principle , to estimate the cme mass by integrating the density @xmath2 over the entire cme sphere , which is of course growing with time , but expected to converge to a maximum value once the cme expands far out into the heliosphere . \n a simple lower limit can analytically be obtained by integrating the density in the cylindrical volume above the footpoint area , @xmath135 from our best - fit values @xmath95 mm , @xmath136 , @xmath137 @xmath123 and the thermal scale height of @xmath138 mm , we obtain a lower limit of @xmath139 g. however , this cme appears to expand in a cone - like fashion in the lowest density scale height , so the total volume and mass is likely to be about a factor of @xmath140 higher . \n moreover , the mass detected in 171 amounts only to about a third of the total cme mass ( aschwanden et al . \n 2009b ) , so a more realistic estimate of the total cme mass is about a factor 6 higher than our lower limit , i.e. , @xmath141 g , which brings it into the ballpark of previous cme mass determinations of this particular event , i.e. , @xmath142 g from stereo / cor-2 white - light observations ( colaninno and vourlidas 2009 ) , or @xmath143 g from stereo / euvi observations ( aschwanden et al . \n we developed an analytical 4d model that simulates the cme expansion and euv dimming in form of a time sequence of euv images that can directly be fitted to stereoscopic observations of stereo / euvi . \n the dynamic evolution of the cme is characterized by a self - similar adiabatic expansion of a spherical cme shell , containing a bright front with density compression and a cavity with density rarefaction , satisfying mass conservation of the cme and ambient corona . \n we forward - fitted this model to stereo / euvi observations of the cme event of 2008-mar-25 and obtained the following results :    1 . \n the model is able to track the true 3d motion and expansion of the cme by stereoscopic triangulation and yields an acceleration of @xmath144 m s@xmath98 for both the vertical centroid motion and radial expansion during the first half hour after cme launch . \n fitting the euv dimming region of the model to the data mostly constrains the coronal base density in the cme region ( @xmath145 @xmath123 ) and the density scale height , which was found to be super - hydrostatic by a factor of @xmath136 . \n the average cme expansion speed during the first 10 minutes is approximately @xmath146 km s@xmath104 , similar to the propagation speeds measured for eit waves in the initial phase ( i.e. , @xmath147 km s@xmath104 , veronig et al . 2008 ; @xmath148 km s@xmath104 , long et al . \n 2008 ; @xmath149 km s@xmath104 , patsourakos et al . 2009 ) , and thus the cme expansion speed seems to be closely related to the associated propagation kinematics of eit waves . \n the derived base density , scale height , and footpoint area constrain the cme mass , but accurate estimates require a more complete temperature coverage with other euv filters ( e.g. , see aschwanden et al . \n 2009b ) . 5 . \n the width and density compression factor of the cme front are also constrained by our model , but accurate values require a perfectly homogeneous cme shell . 6 . \n while the spherical shell geometry reproduces the euvi / a observations well , significant deviations are noted in the euvi / b observations , indicating substantial inhomogeneities in the cme shell , possibly requiring a hybrid model of bubble and flux rope geometries . \n the most important conclusion of this modeling study is that euv dimming can be understood in a quantitative manner and that it provides a direct measurement of the coronal mass loss of a cme . \n this exercise has shown that the spherical shell geometry can reproduce a number of observed features of an evolving cme , which constrains the physical and kinematic parameters of the initial phase of the cme launch , but reveals also significant deviations that require a modification of the idealized homogeneous spherical shell model . \n the method of analytical 4d models with forward - fitting to stereoscopic euv images appears to be a promising tool to investigate quantitatively the kinematics of cmes . combining with simultaneous magnetic or mhd modeling \n may further constrain the physical parameters and ultimately provide the capability to discriminate between different theoretical cme models . \n full 4d modeling of the initial cme expansion may also provide a self - consistent treatment of eit waves and cme expansion ( e.g. , chen et al . 2005 ) , for which we find similar kinematic parameters . \n this work is supported by the nasa stereo under nrl contract n00173 -

       "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) dimming. It confirms a statistical association, with a 55% rate of dimming events associated with CMEs and an 84% rate of CMEs associated with dimming events. The research highlights cases where this correlation does not hold, such as CMEs originating behind the limb or in the upper corona. The paper also discusses the potential improvement in detection rates with the upcoming STEREO spacecraft adjustments. The findings underscore the utility of EUV dimming as a reliable indicator of CME activity."

It presents a method combining double covering and Gorenstein smoothing to construct examples of these surfaces. The paper also demonstrates that these surfaces can have minimal resolutions which are simply connected and of general type, and it discusses the properties and deformations of these resolutions. This work not only contributes to the classification of complex surfaces but also introduces new techniques for handling singularities and deformations in complex geometry."

        "article": "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most attractive extensions of the standard model . \n this symmetry solves the naturalness problem and predicts gauge coupling unification at the gut scale @xmath1 . \n it also predicts the existence of superpartner of the standard model ( sm ) particles . from the naturalness argument , their masses should be below tev range , hence these particles will be discovered at tevatron or large hadron collider ( lhc ) \n .    mechanisms of susy breaking and its mediation to the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) sector are one of the most important problems in the susy phenomenology . in many models , \n this dynamics is related to high energy physics far above the electroweak(ew ) scale , e.g. , gut scale or planck scale . \n once the mechanism is specified , mass spectrum and flavor structure of susy particle at the ew scale can be determined by a small number of parameters . \n hence it may be possible to confirm or exclude the mechanism by direct search or flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) experiments in near future . \n if susy breaking is mediated by gravity , the structure of susy breaking masses of scalars are determined by khler potential . in the present paper , \n we focus on the no - scale type khler potential , in which the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are hidden sector fields and observable sector fields , respectively \n . this type of khler potential is originally investigated in ref . \n @xcite with @xmath5 and @xmath6 . \n characteristic features of the khler potential eq.([eq : noscalekahler ] ) is that all scalar masses and trilinear scalar couplings ( a - terms ) vanish as the cosmological constant vanishes@xcite . \n the only source of susy breaking is gaugino masses . \n hence this scenario is highly predictive , various phenomenological consequences are obtained with a few parameters . the separation in eq.([eq : noscalekahler ] ) implies that couplings of the hidden sector and the observable sector is flavor blind , and contributions of susy particles to fcnc are suppressed . \n therefore this khler potential is also interesting from the viewpoint of the susy flavor problem . \n the no - scale structure of the khler potential is obtained in various models . \n it has been shown that in some classes of string theory , for example weakly coupled @xmath7 heterotic string theory , khler potential becomes the no - scale type@xcite . if the hidden sector and the observable sector are separated in the superspace density in the supergravity lagrangian , the khler potential is indeed given as in eq . \n ( [ eq : noscalekahler ] ) . in the two cases , \n the gaugino masses can be induced if the hidden sector fields couple to the gauge multiplets via the gauge kinetic function . \n recently it has been pointed out that the form eq.([eq : noscalekahler ] ) is realized naturally in a five - dimensional setting with two branes , namely , sequestered sector scenario@xcite . in this scenario , \n the hidden sector fields live on one brane and the visible sector fields live on the other . \n it has been shown that the form of the khler potential of the effective theory obtained by dimensional reduction is indeed eq.([eq : noscalekahler])@xcite . \n if the sm gauge fields dwell in the bulk , gaugino mediate the susy breaking on the hidden sector brane to the visible sector brane and the no - scale boundary condition is given at the compactification scale of the fifth dimension ( gaugino mediation @xcite ) .    in the no - scale scenario , degrees of freedom of susy particle mass spectrum \n is limited because only non - zero soft susy breaking masses are gaugino masses and higgs mixing mass @xmath8 at the energy scale where the boundary condition is given . hence phenomenological aspects of this scenario have been investigated in the literature , mainly focusing on the mass spectrum . \n direct search bounds and the cosmological constraint ( i.e. , a charged particle can not be the lsp if the r - parity is conserved ) were considered and allowed region in the parameter space was identified . for the boundary condition , \n the following three cases were considered . \n first , universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . \n in this case , the cosmological constraint is severe and only the region @xmath9 and @xmath10 is allowed since stau tends to be light@xcite . \n the second case is that universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale . \n and the third case is that non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . in this case wino , \n higgsino or sneutrino can be the lsp . in the latter two cases , \n it is shown that the cosmological constraint is not severer than the first case .    in the present paper , \n current limits from the lightest higgs mass @xmath11 and the branching ratio for @xmath0 are also used to constrain the no - scale scenario . combining these constraints \n , we will show that almost all the parameter region is excluded when universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . \n however , when the boundary condition is given above the gut scale , relatively large parameter region is allowed . \n we also consider the case that the non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . \n we will show that these constraints are important when the higgsino - like neutralino is the lsp . \n this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : noscalsebc ] , we review some phenomenological aspects of the no - scale models , especially indications of the direct search bounds and the cosmological bound . in section [ sec : higgsbsgamma ] , we further constrain these models from the higgs mass bound and @xmath12 result . indications of these bounds for the tevatron are also discussed . \n our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] . \n in this section , we briefly review phenomenological aspects of susy models with no - scale boundary condition , mainly indications of the cosmological bound and direct search limit at lep 2 . \n we consider the following three cases .    * \n universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . \n hereafter we call this case the minimal scenario . * \n universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale @xmath13 . throughout this paper \n , we take the minimal su(5 ) to be the theory above the gut scale as a typical example . * \n non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . \n once one of the above boundary conditions is given , mass spectrum of susy particles at the ew scale and their contributions to fcnc can be calculated . in this paper \n we solve the one - loop level rges to obtain the soft susy breaking mass parameters at the ew scale . \n the higgsino mass parameter @xmath14 is determined by potential minimum condition at the one - loop level . \n first , we discuss the minimal scenario . in this case \n , the following boundary condition is given at the gut scale , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the common scalar mass and @xmath17 is universal trilinear scalar coupling . with this boundary condition , bino and right - handed \n sleptons are lighter than other susy particles . \n their masses are approximately , @xmath18 from eq.([eq : minimalmneumtau ] ) we see that the charged right - handed slepton is the lsp if the d - term @xmath19 is negligible , i.e. , @xmath20 . \n hence this parameter region is excluded by the cosmological consideration . on the other hand , \n lep 2 experiments yields the upper bound on the cross section for smuon pair production , @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23@xcite , so the parameter region @xmath24 is excluded in fig . \n [ fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] , allowed region of the parameter space are shown in the @xmath25 plane . \n the regions above the dash - dotted line and the left side of the dash - dot - dotted line are excluded by cosmological bound and lep 2 bound on smuon pair production , respectively . \n therefore the minimal scenario is constrained severely . \n next we see the case that the universal gaugino masses are given above the gut scale . in the minimal su(5 ) case , the right - handed slepton belongs to 10-plet , so the large group factor makes slepton masses heavier . \n for example , when @xmath26 the bino mass and the right - handed slepton mass at the weak scale are approximately given , @xmath27 hence the cosmological constraint is not severe because the stau mass is large enough and neutralino is the lsp in the large parameter region @xcite . in the fig.[fig : limitmbc1e17posmu ] and [ fig : limitmbc1e17negmu ] , the same figures as in the fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] are shown . \n unlike in the minimal case , the stau search bound at lep @xcite is also plotted because mass difference between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is larger than in the minimal case and it can be stronger than the smuon search . from these figures we see that the @xmath29 lsp is avoided unless @xmath30 is larger than about 20 . \n the charged stau lsp can also be avoided if gaugino masses at the gut scale are non - universal@xcite , i.e. , the following boundary condition is given , @xmath31 this boundary condition can be given naturally within the gut framework @xcite . in this case , \n not only bino - like neutralino , but also wino - like , higgsino - like neutralino or sneutrino can be the lsp . for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , \n the lsp is wino - like neutralino . \n for example , when @xmath34 and @xmath35 , then wino mass and charged slepton mass are ( notice that in this case the left - handed sleptons are lighter than right - handed sleptons ) ; @xmath36 the higgsino is the lsp if @xmath37 . for example , when @xmath38 and @xmath39 , then the higgsino mass and the right - handed slepton mass are @xmath40 in the two cases given above , neutral wino or higgsino is the lsp . \n in fact from fig.[fig : limit12r432r2posmu ] - [ fig : limit12r232r0.5negmu ] we find that neural particle is the lsp in large parameter region , thus it is cosmologically viable . \n in the previous section we take into account only lep 2 bound and the cosmological constraint . \n we find that the minimal scenario is severely constrained , but the other two scenarios are not . in this section \n we also include the current higgs mass bound and @xmath41 constraint . \n as we will see , combining the above four constraint , not only the minimal case but also the other two scenarios can be constrained more severely . \n we also discuss the possibility whether this scenario can be seen at the tevatron run 2 or not . \n before we show the numerical results , some remarks on our calculation of the higgs mass and @xmath12 are in order . \n it is well known that radiative correction is important when the lightest higgs mass is evaluated @xcite . in the present paper , \n the lightest higgs mass is evaluated by means of the one - loop level effective potential@xcite . \n this potential is evaluated at the renormalization point of the geometrical mean of the two stop mass eigenvalues @xmath42 . \n we compared our result with a two - loop result by using _ \n feynhiggs_@xcite , and checked that the difference between these two results is smaller than 5 gev as long as @xmath30 is bigger than 5 . \n when @xmath30 is close to 2 , the difference can be 7 gev . \n however , as we will see later , higgs mass bound plays an important rule around @xmath43 . and \n the two - loop effects always make the higgs mass lighter than that obtained at the one - loop level . \n so our conclusion is conservative and is not significantly changed by the two - loop effect . \n we exclude the parameter region where the lightest higgs mass is lighter than the current 95% c.l . \n limit from lep 2 experiments , @xmath44 @xcite .    in the present paper , @xmath12 \n is calculated including leading order ( lo ) qcd corrections@xcite , and compare it to the current cleo measurement . in the mssm \n , chargino contribution can be comparable to the sm and charged higgs contributions . \n they interfere constructively ( destructively ) each other when @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) . \n the difference between the lo and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) result can be sizable only when cancellation among different contributions at the lo is spoiled by the nlo contributions . \n as we will see , however , the @xmath41 constraint is severe when the interference is constructive . in the case of destructive interference where the deviation from the nlo result may be large , \n this constraint is not so important . \n hence we expect that our conclusion is not changed significantly by the inclusion of the nlo corrections . for the experimental value \n , we use 95% c.l . \n limit from cleo , @xmath47 @xcite . \n first we show the numerical results for the minimal case . \n the case for @xmath48 is shown in fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] . in this case , for small @xmath30 region , the stop mass is not so large that radiative correction factor @xmath49 which raises the higgs mass is small . \n ( for example , @xmath50 gev and @xmath51 gev for @xmath52 gev and @xmath53 ) . \n hence the higgs mass limit constrains this scenario severely . in fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] , the higgs mass bound and @xmath12 constraints in the @xmath54 plane are shown . \n the regions below the solid line and above the dashed line are excluded by the higgs mass and @xmath12 bound , respectively . \n the indication of @xmath55 reported by lep 2@xcite is also shown in this figure . from the figure we find that the higgs mass bound almost excludes the region where the stau lsp is avoided . \n note that , as we discussed earlier , the bound we put on the higgs mass may be conservative , because the two loop correction may further reduce the higgs mass .    the same figure but for @xmath56 is shown in fig.[fig : limitmimnegmu ] . \n now @xmath12 also constrains parameter region strongly since chargino contribution to @xmath0 interferes with sm and charged higgs ones constructively . \n the region above the dashed line is excluded by @xmath12 constraint . \n we find that only one of the two constraints is enough to exclude all the region where cosmological bound and the smuon mass bound are avoided . \n hence if r - parity is conserved , i.e. , the cosmological bound is relevant , this scenario with @xmath56 is excluded . \n next we show the numerical results in the case that the cutoff scale is larger than the gut scale . as a typical example , we choose the minimal su(5 ) as the theory above the gut scale . in fig.[fig : \n limitmbc1e17posmu ] and [ fig : limitmbc1e17negmu ] , results are shown for positive and negative @xmath14 , respectively . in both figures , \n we take @xmath58 gev . for @xmath48 case , large parameter region \n is allowed and susy scale @xmath59 can be as small as about 180 gev , which indicates the lsp mass @xmath60 gev . for @xmath56 , as in the minimal case , @xmath12 constraint is severer , and @xmath59 must be larger than around 280 gev . \n we also considered other values of the boundary scale @xmath61 from @xmath62 to @xmath63 , and checked that the behavior of the contour plot does not change so much . \n according to ref.@xcite , tevatron run 2 experiment can explore up to @xmath64 gev for integrated luminosity @xmath65 . \n hence if @xmath66 and @xmath67 , susy particles can be discovered at the experiment . in this range , \n trilepton from chargino - neutralino associated production @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 is one of clean signals for susy search . \n notice that now two body decay @xmath71 opens . \n so same flavor , opposite sign dilepton from @xmath72 decay may be useful . \n the two body decay allows us to observe the peak edge of invariant mass of two leptons at the @xmath73 . \n it is expressed in terms of the neutralino masses and the slepton mass as , @xmath74 in table [ tab : mllmax ] , the dependence of @xmath73 on @xmath61 is shown . here \n we fix @xmath75 . \n notice that as @xmath61 changes , the right - handed mass changes sizably while the neutralino masses do not . \n hence we can obtain the mass relation among them and also cutoff scale @xmath61 , which corresponds to the compactification scale in the sequestered sector scenario , by measuring @xmath73 . on the other hand , since only @xmath76 gev is allowed for @xmath45 , the tevatron run 2 can not survey this scenario , and we have to wait lhc experiment . \n next , we turn to the case that gaugino masses are non - universal at the gut scale . \n we explore the following three cases , wino - like neutralino lsp , higgsino - like neutralino lsp and the tau sneutrino lsp . \n we will see that in the wino - like neutralino lsp and tau sneutrino lsp cases , constraint is not so severe even if we combine higgs mass bound and @xmath12 data , but in the higgsino - like lsp case where stops are as light as sleptons and charginos , the predicted higgs mass tends to be small , and thus the higgs mass bound becomes important . \n first , we discuss the wino - lsp case . \n the results for @xmath34 , @xmath35 are shown in fig.[fig : limit12r432r2posmu ] and fig.[fig : limit12r432r2negmu ] , for @xmath46 and @xmath45 , respectively . in this case , we obtain a relatively large higgs mass since @xmath77 is large and so are the masses of stops . \n hence , for @xmath46 , @xmath78 can be as small as 100 gev at @xmath43 , where the mass of the lsp @xmath79 is about 90 gev . for @xmath45 \n , though @xmath12 constraint is slightly severer than in the @xmath46 case , @xmath80 is allowed , which corresponds to @xmath81 . \n hence the wino - lsp with mass around 100 gev is allowed . \n examples of the mass spectrum in this case are listed as point a ( @xmath46 ) and point b ( @xmath45 ) in table [ tab : spectrum ] . at the both points , \n @xmath59 is chosen to be near the smallest value such that all constraints are avoided . \n in general , however , masses of @xmath28 and @xmath82 are highly degenerate when wino is the lsp . \n in fact , from table [ tab : spectrum ] , we see that the mass difference is less than 1 gev . \n therefore a lepton from @xmath70 is very soft and trilepton signal search is not useful because acceptance cut usually requires the smallest transverse momentum of the three leptons @xmath83 to be larger than 5 gev@xcite . \n recently collider phenomenology in such cases are studied in ref . \n it is shown that certain range of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , susy signals which are different from those in the minimal case can be detected . \n the high degeneracy requires to include radiative corrections to calculate @xmath85 @xcite , which is beyond of this work . \n it deserves detail study to estimate the mass difference in the scenario . \n since the constraint for the sneutrino lsp case in the @xmath86 plane is similar to those in the wino - lsp case , we show the result for @xmath46 only in fig.[fig : limit12r2.532r1.5posmu ] . in the figure \n , we take @xmath87 and @xmath88 . \n notice that the decomposition of the lsp depends on @xmath30 and the sneutrino is the lsp for @xmath89 . \n an example of the mass spectrum is listed as the point c in table [ tab : spectrum ] . in this case , \n trilepton signal comes from @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 . \n since @xmath93 , @xmath94 of a lepton from @xmath82 decay is small and this signal may be hard to be detected . \n we may need unusual trigger to explore this scenario . \n next , we turn to the higgsino lsp case . \n higgsino lsp scenario is realized when @xmath77 is smaller than half of @xmath78 , which indicates that colored particles are lighter than in the universal gaugino mass case . \n hence the one - loop correction to the higgs potential which enhances the higgs mass is small and the higgs mass constraint is important . the same figures as fig.[fig : limitmimposmu ] and [ fig : limitmimnegmu ] are shown in fig.[fig : limit12r232r0.5posmu ] ( @xmath46 ) and fig.[fig : limit12r232r0.5negmu ] ( @xmath45 ) for @xmath95 and @xmath39 . in order to satisfy the higgs mass bound , @xmath78 must be larger than around 300 gev . \n combining the bound with @xmath12 , constraint becomes severer , especially for @xmath45 case where @xmath96 is required . \n example of mass spectrum in this scenario is listed as point d and e in table [ tab : spectrum ] . \n again we choose almost the smallest value of @xmath78 where all constraints are avoided . \n we see that the lsp mass must be at least @xmath97 for @xmath46 and @xmath98 for @xmath45 . \n hence this scenario can not be explored at the tevatron run 2 . \n the no - scale type boundary conditions are obtained in various types of susy models . \n this scenario is attractive because it is highly predictive and can be a solution to the susy flavor problem . in this paper \n we investigated the indication of the current higgs mass and @xmath41 constraint on susy models with the boundary condition . \n first we considered the minimal case where the universal gaugino mass are given at the gut scale . \n this scenario has been already constrained by direct search at lep and the cosmological bound severely , under the assumption of the exact r - parity . \n we showed that the higgs mass bound and @xmath41 constraint are also taken into account , then almost all the parameter region is excluded , leaving very narrow allowed region for @xmath48 . \n next we considered the case that the boundary condition is given above the gut scale . \n since the cosmological constraint is not severe , wide region of the parameter space is allowed . in the @xmath46 case , \n tevatron have a chance to observe susy signatures like trilepton events . \n the scale @xmath61 may be explored by measuring the peak edge of invariant mass of two leptons at the @xmath73 . \n however for the @xmath45 case , since @xmath99 is required , we have to wait lhc . \n finally we considered the case where non - universal gaugino masses are given at the gut scale . \n we see that the higgs mass bound is strong in the higgsino lsp case because stop masses are as light as sleptons and charginos . \n the mass of the higgsino - like neutralino must be larger than about 245 gev and 370 gev for @xmath46 and @xmath45 , respectively . in the wino lsp and sneutrino lsp case \n , the mass of the lsp can be as small as 150 gev . \n however , the mass difference between the lsp and parent particles produced at the collider is much smaller than in the minimal case , unusual acceptance cut may be required . \n the author would like to thank m. yamaguchi for suggesting the subject , fruitful discussion and careful reading of the manuscript . \n he also thanks t. moroi and m. m. nojiri for useful discussion . \n j. ellis , c. kounnas and d.v . \n nanopoulos , nucl . \n b247 ( 1984 ) 373 ; j. ellis , a.b . \n lahanas , d.v . \n nanopoulos and k. tamvakis , phys . \n b134 ( 1984 ) 439 ; a.b . \n lahanas and d.v . \n nanopoulos , phys . \n ( 1987 ) 1 . \n e. witten , phys . \n b155 ( 1985 ) 151 . \n t. banks and m. dine , nucl . \n b505 ( 1997 ) 445 ; h.p . \n nilles , m. olechowski and m. yamaguchi , phys . \n b415 ( 1997 ) 24 ; nucl . \n phys . b530 \n ( 1998 ) 43 ; z. lalak and s. thomas , nucl . \n phys . b515 \n ( 1998 ) 55 ; a. lukas , b.a . \n ovrut and d. waldram , nucl . \n phys . b532 \n ( 1998 ) 43 ; phys . \n d57 ( 1998 ) 7529 ; k. choi , h.b . \n kim and c. muoz , phys . \n d57 ( 1998 ) 7521 . \n y. okada , m. yamaguchi and t. yanagida , prog . \n 85 ( 1991 ) 1 , phys . \n b262 ( 1991 ) 54 ; j. ellis , g. ridolfi and f. zwirner , phys . \n b257 ( 1991 ) 83 ; h. e. haber and r. hempfling , phys . \n 66 ( 1991 ) 1815 . \n aleph collabolation , phys . \n b495 ( 2000 ) 1 ; l3 collabolation , phys . \n b495 ( 2000 ) 18 ; delphi collabolation , phys . \n b499 ( 2001 ) 23 ; opal collabolation , phys . \n b499 ( 2001 ) 38 ; p. \n igo -

      "abstract": "This paper discusses Supersymmetry (SUSY) as an extension of the Standard Model, addressing its potential to resolve the naturalness problem and achieve gauge coupling unification at high energy scales. It focuses on SUSY breaking mechanisms and their mediation, particularly through no-scale type Kähler potentials that suggest a distinct mass spectrum and flavor structure at the electroweak scale. This paper explores the phenomenological implications of these models, including the direct search bounds and cosmological constraints on SUSY particle masses, using the lightest Higgs mass and branching ratios for rare processes as experimental probes. The study highlights the predictive power of the no-scale models and their implications for future collider experiments."

        "article": "the origin - destination ( od ) matrix is important in transportation analysis . \n the matrix contains information on the number of travellers that commute or the amount of freight shipped between different zones of a region . \n the od matrix is difficult and often costly to obtain by direct measurements / interviews or surveys , but by using incomplete traffic counts and other available information one may obtain a reasonable estimate . \n a particular application of the od matrix estimation is in the area of public transport . in order to improve their service , \n the responsible managers are looking for on - going evaluation of the passenger flow and the reasons that would influence this flow . \n this is typically the case for the city rail , sydney bus and sydney ferry organisations , which handle the public transport in the region around the city of sydney , australia . \n cityrail and co are handling a large number of stations ( wharfs , bus stops ) for trains ( buses and ferries ) across the state . they carry thousands of passengers every day , and periodically optimise the time - table schedule to best meet the changing demand . \n +   + an ideal optimization of the schedule would consider the resources in trains , drivers , stations and passengers . \n while the primary informations ( trains , drivers , stations ) are known to cityrail and co , the number of passenger on each train between each station can not be deduced easily given their current passenger flow data collection processes . \n +   + various approaches to estimating the od matrix using traffic counts have been developed and tested @xcite using traffic counts , or road traffic flows @xcite , @xcite . \n most of the papers in the literature solve this problem by postulating a general model for the trip distribution , for example a gravity type model @xcite , which aims at introducing a prior knowledge on the traffic flows and assigning a cost to each journey . \n then the inference is produced to estimate the parameters of this model . \n all these papers _ are not passengers oriented_. + most of the work relating to od matrix estimation are based on passengers observations assuming the knowledge of where the people get in and out of the public transport . \n lo et al @xcite developed a framework centred on the passenger choice , which they called the random link choice , and model this to obtain a maximum likelihood estimator . \n nandi et al @xcite applied a strategy centred on a fixed cost per person per kilometre assumption on the air - route network of india and provide some comparisons with the real data . \n + when the information is not available ( for example we have no data on when passengers get off the bus ) , kostakos @xcite offers to use a wireless detection of the passengers trips , and lundgren and peterson s model @xcite is based on a target od - matrix previously defined . however , none of the cited work considered using survey data . indeed , if no complete information is available about the passengers destinations , the simplest solution is to use an appropriate survey to estimate destination information . furthermore , what characteristics of the survey are required for the estimation to be accurate ? \n bierliaire and toint @xcite introduces a structure - based estimation of the origin - destination matrix based on parking surveys . in their article , they used the parking surveys to infer an a priori estimate of the od matrix , and they used this prior in coordination with the partial observations of the network flows to derive a generalized least square estimator of the od matrix . despite its novelty , this article assume that the behaviour of car - user and public transport users are the same , at least regarding their respective od matrix . given that the public transport network topology is often different from the road network topology , one may doubt the accuracy of this assumption . \n moreover , they just use the partial structure extracted from the surveys . \n + the purpose of this paper is then to develop an estimation procedure for the origin - destination matrix based on the ticket records available for the transport network and/or on previous surveys . unlike the article from bierliaire @xcite , \n we use survey data collection from public transport users , and estimate the approximate whole matrix structure through the estimation of its eigenvectors . \n we propose a robust version of the estimator to avoid biases induced by the survey . \n we also construct a regression estimation procedure that accounts for the influence of exogenous variable such as the weather conditions or the time of the year . \n + we first briefly present the passenger model , and then move on to outlining the observations model . in section [ sec : om ] , we explain how the measurements are obtained , and what measurements error should be expected . in section \n [ sec : mam ] , we explain the assumptions we make on the measurements , and how this affects our estimation procedure . \n we present in section [ sec : est ] the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation procedure , by providing a system of equation to be solved , for deriving estimators . \n we improve on this ml estimation to make it robust to survey biases in section [ sec : rob ] . finally , we present a simulation example and an application to a real world case in section [ sec : app ] . \n we finally comment on the results and outline some future research opportunities . \n let @xmath0 be the matrix of passengers number between the stations in the rail network over time period @xmath1 so that @xmath2 is the number of passengers who depart from station @xmath3 and arrive at station @xmath4 at time period @xmath1 . \n given that there is an obvious time dependency here , denoted by @xmath1 the period in which the commuting occur ( for example a day ) . \n the purpose of this work is to provide an estimation of @xmath0 given the observations specified in section [ sec : om ] . \n the observations provided about the passengers are very different , and only considering them all allow a direct estimation of @xmath0 . \n we list in the subsections [ om - casual],[om - deparr ] and [ om - regular ] the different kind of observations . \n a casual commuter is defined as a single or return journey that is not repeated regularly ( e.g. daily ) . \n typically , people going to a once - in - a - year event will buy their ticket for that trajectory and will probably return on the same day . accordingly for single and day return tickets , we have complete information under the assumption that they take the next train after purchasing their ticket and that they take the shortest route . \n let @xmath5 be that matrix of measurements . \n each journey between major stations , the passenger has to validate his ticket through the machines at the entrance of the station , and do it again at the exit . between minor stations \n we assume they take the next train to arrive at the station they purchased their ticket at and assume they take the trio planners recommended route for that time . \n two scenarios are considered . in the first one , ( called @xmath6 ) , every station in the network have these machines . in the second case ( called @xmath7 ) only major stations have these machines . in any case \n , let call @xmath8 the vector corresponding to the departures at the stations , and @xmath9 the vector of arrivals . \n fortunately we can have regular passengers with specific departure and destination , and this matrix will be denoted @xmath10 , where the rows stand for the departure stations and the columns for the arrival stations . this matrix is observed , and assumed distributed according to a poisson probability function with mean @xmath11 . \n + the main part of the information , however , remains unknown . \n indeed most of the passengers will probably have a zone ticket for a period of time , from 1 week to 1 year . \n the nature of these tickets make the station of departure and arrival unknown , and is the main challenge of this paper . \n let call @xmath12 the matrix of zone passengers numbers . \n + to make a proper statistical inference , we need two assumptions ;    * the traveller will act independently of the validity duration of his ticket ; * the regular traveller commits to a return journey on each working day . \n the observations linked to this model are two - folds . for major stations \n , we have the total number of passengers that crossed the boom gates , in and out . for stations without boom gates , the observations have to estimated using a survey \n . we also have access to the total number of people with a valid zone ticket at time @xmath1 ( e.g. the day of the analysis ) , denoted @xmath13 , @xmath14 in the end , the total number of regular passenger at the time period @xmath1 will be denoted @xmath15 , and we have , @xmath16 \n with these very different observations , we need a good fitting model based on reasonable assumptions . sections [ mam - gm ] , [ mam - cm ] , [ mam - da ] and [ mam - rm ] presents these assumptions for each parameter in our model . \n recall that @xmath17 is a matrix of count , the main assumption on that matrix is that the number of passenger is the sum of the casual passengers ( @xmath18 ) plus the regular passengers ( @xmath15 ) plus a matrix stating the unusual big events such as major sporting events , or large concerts ( called @xmath19 ) ,    @xmath20      the casual commuter journey could be assumed to be poisson distributed i.e. @xmath21 is supposed to be drawn with a poisson distribution which parameter belong to the matrix @xmath22 . ] where @xmath22 is the matrix of means for the counts . \n + however , the variance of the counts are not expected to be equal to their mean and so the poisson counts assumption may be unrealistic . \n therefore , we decided to use a negative binomial regression model for @xmath23 , which can be over - dispersed in order to better describe the distribution of the counts . \n we specify that @xmath22 is distributed according to a gamma distribution , @xmath24 . for a purpose of simplicity , \n let @xmath23 be distributed as negative binomial with parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( we will denote @xmath27 ) .      according to the definition of the measurements , \n the following relationships hold : @xmath28 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the vectors of the total number of departures and arrivals at each station during time period @xmath1 .      for the same reasons as described for the casual matrix \n , we will use a negative binomial distribution to model the uncertainty around the regular traveller s information . \n however , unlike the casual commuter , we do not suspect an over - dispersion but an under - dispersion , so that , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . let @xmath31 and @xmath32 be the expectation of @xmath33 and @xmath34 . \n when the model is well defined , the estimation procedure is computationally straight forward , e.g. , between major stations where we have complete information of arrivals and departures . \n meaning that the maximum likelihood estimation method accuracy , practically depends on the efficient solving of the optimization problem . in this section , \n the stationary model parameters are estimated from the data . \n since the process is unlikely to be stationary , we present a second option ( section [ est : reg ] ) , a multivariate spatio - temporal model that we expect to fit the data better . \n the estimation procedure will be carried out in well - defined steps . \n if we ignore the time dependence , the successive observations can be considered independent , identical random counts from negative binomial or poisson distribution . \n this means that simple maximum likelihood estimation should work well , especially for large sample sizes . \n we observe @xmath18 for several realizations . given no space -

term tickets ) . \n we have information of the times they enter and departs at major stations but we do nt have complete information for the long term tickets either to or from minor stations . \n our assumption here is that only a proportion @xmath39 of the @xmath32 people will travel on day @xmath1 , where @xmath40 . \n @xmath39 is an additional parameter that reflects the passengers habit . \n it does exist because when performing the estimation , one may find a bigger estimation of travellers than what is observed . \n some of the difference is due to the randomness of @xmath41 , but it might also be explained by the fact that travellers with prepaid long term tickets will not necessary travel each of the working day of the week . \n + however , we may provide the same estimation for the @xmath31 parameters as we did in the previous section , that is , @xmath42 where @xmath43 stands for the same likelihood function as above . \n + this leads us to the final estimation , the contribution this paper makes to the literature . \n the aim is to estimate the matrix @xmath12 with the available departure and arrival data . \n the first step is to estimate the general shape of the @xmath10 matrix . \n the problem is to achieve this in a simple way given that @xmath12 is to be estimated with @xmath44 parameters , and only @xmath45 equations . \n the following paragraph presents an elegant solution to this problem . \n + recall @xmath32 as the expectation of @xmath46 . \n it is assumed symmetric , we can diagonalize it , so that , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a projection matrix of eigenvectors of @xmath32 and @xmath49 is a @xmath44 diagonal matrix , with terms equal to the respective eigenvalues . therefore , \n if the structure of @xmath32 is known ( i.e. the eigenvectors are known ) and constant , then we have reduced the problem to solving a system of @xmath45 unknown parameters with @xmath45 equations . \n [ eq : odeq ] and the previous estimations , we have the following system , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are obtained by simple subtraction . \n the probability density function of the observations @xmath53 can then be written , @xmath54 \\quad p \\big ( y_{di}^t \\vert r_z , p_{rz } \\big ) & \\sim & \\mathcal{nb } ( \\sum_j r^{ij}_z , p_{rz})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and @xmath56 . \n according to this equation , we then have @xmath57 likelihood equations ( @xmath58 $ ] ) but @xmath59 parameters to estimate ( @xmath32 being symmetric ) . to perform the estimation \n , we then need to reduce the number of parameters . according to eq . \n [ eq : diag ] , we have , @xmath60 then , if we knew @xmath48 , the maximum likelihood would be tractable and provide an estimation of @xmath32 ( with @xmath61 being the @xmath3th eigenvalue ) . the @xmath57 likelihoods would look like , @xmath62 \\quad l \\big ( y_{di}^t \\vert r_z , p_{rz } \\big ) & = & \\prod_t p \\big ( y_{di}^t \\vert r_z , p_{rz } \\big)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 . \n the maximum likelihood estimating equations are then , @xmath64 moreover , this complex equation can be simplified by assuming that the observations are independent conditionally on knowing the parameters ( e.g. the errors are independents ) , and then , @xmath65 the dimension of the parameter space is reduced according to the knowledge of @xmath48 . to estimate @xmath48 , \n remember that @xmath31 is symmetric , we have , @xmath66 then , we make the assumption that all the regular passengers behave identically over time , that is , @xmath48 is not a function of time . \n then we have , @xmath67 then @xmath48 can be estimated from @xmath68 , and introduced into equation [ eq : density ] to obtain eq . [ eq : mle ] . finally , we can use @xmath69 and @xmath70 to estimate @xmath71 . \n finding the solution of equation [ eq : mle ] is a classic optimization problem . \n the simple likelihood shape insures the existence of a solution , and it can be found by any standard optimization function . \n let this solution be @xmath72 . \n the problem with this estimator is that we can not guarantee that it will fulfil the underlying constraint of the density parameters . \n indeed , some values in the matrix will be negative , and there will be some element in the diagonal that wo nt be null . \n therefore , some constraints have to be added to the ml estimating equations . \n these are : + * constraint 1 * _ all the elements in the matrix @xmath73 are greater than or equal to zero , or equivalently , @xmath74 _ + * constraint 2 * _ all the diagonal elements in the matrix @xmath71 must be zero , or equivalently , @xmath75 _ + * constraint 3 * _ the last set of parameters to be estimated is the probability matrix @xmath76 . \n therefore , all the elements should belong to the interval @xmath77 $ ] , @xmath78 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] _ most of the optimization algorithms that deal with the constraint require an initialization which belong to the constrained space . \n one could be tempted to address as a starting point the mean value of the observations , according to the one - dimensional ( @xmath79 ) result . \n however , it is very unlikely that this initial point will satisfy the constraints . \n therefore , the best choice so far seems to be the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath80 , given that they naturally fill * constraint 1 * and * constraint 2*. +   + the complete optimization program therefore becomes , @xmath81 with the initial value @xmath82 . \n this optimization program can be replaced by an explicit expression of the estimator , subject to some constraints stated in [ ann : a ] . \n the main constraint is the poisson distribution assumption , so that we have , + * proposition 1 : * _ assume that @xmath83 , then @xmath84^{-1 } \\bar{y}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is the matrix of estimated eigenvalues of @xmath32 . _ \n + if now we consider a gaussian likelihood instead of poisson , the following maximum likelihood estimator is found , + * proposition 2 : * _ assume that @xmath86 , then @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the matrix of estimated eigenvalues of @xmath32 . _ + the proofs of propositions 1 and 2 are presented in [ ann : a ] . \n we can also derive the follwing theorem , that ensures us of the quality of the estimation , + * theorem 1 * + assume that @xmath89{\\ a.s.\\ } p$ ] ( see anderson @xcite,@xcite ) . \n then we have , @xmath90{\\ \\mathcal{p } \\ } \\lambda\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the proof is presented in [ ann : b ] . \n if we want to deal with a more realistic modelling , it seems obvious that we have to consider spatial , temporal and multivariate influences on the number of passengers , and then on the parameters of our modelling . \n + let @xmath91 be a set of exogenous features , and @xmath92 their corresponding ( unknown ) influence on the number of passengers . \n therefore , the regression model can be written , + @xmath54 \\quad p \\big ( y_{di}^t \\vert r_z , p_{rz } , ( x_i)_i \\big ) & \\sim & \\mathcal{nb } \\big ( \\sum_{k } \\lambda_k p_{ik } \\sum_j p_{jk } + \\sum_l x_l \\beta_l , p_{rz}\\big)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameters to be estimated are @xmath93 . \n the likelihood is expressed as in eq . \n [ eq : like ] , and we have , @xmath94 then , if we consider the projection matrix to be constant over time , then we have the following proposition ( proved in [ ann : c ] ) , + * proposition 3 : * _ if we apply the same methodology as before we obtain the following estimator , @xmath95^{-1 } y { } ^t x ( x { } ^t x)^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the matrix of the exogenous variables . _ + a more complex solution would be to perform the same technique as before , except that @xmath48 will no longer be constant . \n therefore , the varying @xmath97 estimated from @xmath31 will help in the recovery of the matrix @xmath32 . \n the reason why we can not perform a direct estimation of the @xmath98 s through this technique is because @xmath32 can be diagonalize , but we do nt know how the @xmath98 influence the @xmath99 . \n then a space - time model for the regular zone passenger is required . \n a further sensitivity analysis has to be run in order to figure out if the results are significantly affected by the increased uncertainty . \n the quality of the estimator will strongly depend on the survey sub - matrix @xmath31 . in section [ sec : est ] , we assume that the similarity between the matrix @xmath31 and @xmath32 relies on the projection matrix @xmath48 and @xmath100 . \n moreover , we assume @xmath101 ( eq . [ eq : ass1 ] ) , and this assumption is the key to derive the propositions @xmath102 . + it is however difficult to design and implement a survey that provides accurate information . therefore , eq . [ eq : ass1 ] is no longer valid . to overcome this \n , we propose to consider an ad hoc estimation of the o - d matrix . \n +      despite the survey having some unknown biases , it provides useful information that we need . \n let @xmath88 be the estimation based on the eigenvalues of @xmath32 , relying on the assumption @xmath101 . while inaccurate , this estimation looks like the perfect prior information . \n we define , @xmath103 now , given that the survey may be biased , we need to emphasize the influence of the observations @xmath104 , by building an observation - based matrix @xmath105 , such that , @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 . \n @xmath109 is symmetric , and roughly correspond to an equal partition of the passengers in the different stations . \n let @xmath110 . \n now , we need to integrate the information provided by @xmath109 . \n then we define the final ad hoc estimator @xmath111 , @xmath112      we define the robustness of our estimation as its ability to overcome biased survey results . \n to analyse the performance of the estimators , we considered that the parameter matrix of the survey was biased according to the following two equations , @xmath113 where @xmath114 $ ] stands for the scale of the survey , @xmath115 $ ] stands for the varying noise level , and @xmath116 means the poisson distribution , and , @xmath117 the difference between the two equations relies in the bias structure . in eq . \n [ eq : noise ] , integer values are randomly added regardless of the real value of the parameter . \n it is the kind of errors we expect to find in badly designed surveys or respondents responding randomly . in eq . \n [ eq : prop.noise ] , we consider that the bias keeps the same structure as the @xmath32 matrix . \n this is more an equivalent of a measurement error usually described in the literature with centred gaussian distributions . \n therefore , we expect the estimators to provide better estimates when the survey s parameters are driven by eq . \n [ eq : prop.noise ] . \n + figure [ fig : sensnoise ] shows the ml and ad hoc estimation results for the two kind of bias , with different number of observations and different strength of bias . as expected , the second type of error ( eq . [ eq : prop.noise ] ) is more easily overcome by the estimators . \n the important conclusion we can make from this result is that the ad hoc estimation performs better than the naive ml estimation , no matter what kind of noise we add . \n the ad - hoc estimation is plotted in green . \n the upper line stands for a bias designed according to eq . \n [ eq : noise ] , and the bottom line for eq . \n [ eq : prop.noise ] . \n the mse is calculated among @xmath118 simulations . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=226 ]   ci . \n the ad - hoc estimation is plotted in green . \n the upper line stands for a bias designed according to eq . \n [ eq : noise ] , and the bottom line for eq . \n [ eq : prop.noise ] . \n the mse is calculated among @xmath118 simulations . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=226 ] +   ci . \n the ad - hoc estimation is plotted in green . \n the upper line stands for a bias designed according to eq . \n [ eq : noise ] , and the bottom line for eq . \n [ eq : prop.noise ] . \n the mse is calculated among @xmath118 simulations . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=226 ]   ci . \n the ad - hoc estimation is plotted in green . \n the upper line stands for a bias designed according to eq . \n [ eq : noise ] , and the bottom line for eq . \n [ eq : prop.noise ] . \n the mse is calculated among @xmath118 simulations . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=226 ]    finally , and also very important , the ad hoc estimator seems more consistent and its performances are less affected by the number of available observations . \n for instance , we can observe that the log(mse ) profile is identical in fig . \n [ fig : sensnoise ] for @xmath119 observations and for @xmath120 . \n the importance of that being to allow some reliable time - dependency analysis ( on a monthly basis , it would mean @xmath121 observations ) , which would be more complicated with the ml estimation . \n let m be a @xmath122 matrix , representing departure and arrival stations ( origin and destination ) . \n we assume that any value of m is a random number , generated according to the matrix of parameters @xmath123 , and the probability @xmath124 . \n the matrix @xmath123 has the following values , @xmath125\\ ] ] let @xmath126 be an observed sub - sample of m , i.e. only a proportion @xmath127 of m is represented in @xmath126 . \n we assume that for every value of m , @xmath127 will be the same , only perturbed by some low - level additive noise . \n a realization of @xmath126 is the following matrix , @xmath128\\ ] ] the value of @xmath127 in this example is roughly equal to @xmath129 . the estimation of @xmath130 is performed with the observations of this matrix . \n then , @xmath130 being symmetric , we diagonalize it , and using the optimization program described in section [ sec : oi ] we are able to provide the following estimated @xmath131 matrix ( for @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 observations respectively ) , @xmath136 & \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccccc } 0 & 68 & 24 & 42 & 54 \\\\ 68 & 0 & 18 & 36 & 124 \\\\ 24 & 18 & 0 & 126 & 12 \\\\ 42 & 36 & 126 & 0 & 18 \\\\ 54 & 124 & 12 & 18 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ] \\\\ &   \\\\ \\left \n [ \\begin{array}{ccccc } 0 & 78 & 12 & 60 & 42 \\\\ 78 & 0 & 24 & 48 & 78 \\\\ 12 & 24 & 0 & 102 & 12 \\\\ 60 & 48 & 102 & 0 & 24 \\\\ 42 & 78 & 12 & 24 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ] & \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccccc } 0 & 72 & 12 & 54 & 48 \\\\ 72 & 0 & 24 & 42 & 78 \\\\ 12 & 24 & 0 & 96 & 12 \\\\ 54 & 42 & 96 & 0 & 24 \\\\ 48 & 78 & 12 & 24 & 0 \\end{array } \\right ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] table [ tble : mse_bin ] provides the mean square error of the estimator for different number of observations and different value of dispersion in the case of a negative binomial modelling . \n we also display in table [ tble : norm_test ] the p - values for the cramer - von mises normality test of @xmath137 estimation procedures for each eigenvalue . \n .[tble : mse_bin ] negative binomial modelling : values of the mean square error of the parameter estimation with different number of observations and different distribution assumption over @xmath137 replication of the simulation , and the according variance ( under brackets ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we consider as an example the passengers commuting from the sydney region ferry , according to five surveys organized in @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 by the bureau of transport statistics of new south wales . \n the overall survey could have been analysed , but in order to be understandable , we will focus our analysis on the eastern suburbs route , composed with @xmath141 different wharfs and @xmath142 different days . \n [ fig : lpw20xx ] represents the links between the wharfs , meaning that you can have a direct access by taking only one ferry . \n +    as we can see from the plots , all the wharfs seem to be able to be reached starting from any other wharf , except for darling point , watsons bay and garden island . \n + starting from this , the objective is the estimation of the od matrix , which is almost like the ferry links matrix presented in the figures except that instead of logical values , it will be filled by counts of passengers . \n however , this survey does not provide enough data to perform this estimation . \n in particular , it does nt give any observation on the ticket sales at the wharfs . \n then , to provide an estimation , we use a different survey from the same institute , which aimed at understanding the preferred mean of transport for people going to work . from this database , we only kept those who declared taking the ferry . \n +    before we could provide an analysis of these data , we had to consider that the origins and destination of the people in the second survey did nt correspond to the wharfs of the first survey . therefore , we decided to attribute to every passenger the starting point of their journey as the closest wharf to their home , and a destination point the closest wharf to their office . \n the distance have been calculated according to each wharf and location longitude and latitude values . \n this being done , we can provide a new origin - destination matrix . \n it is plotted in fig . \n [ fig : jw2006 ] . \n +    this od matrix is then supposed to have the same structure as the regular od of the barrier counts . \n therefore , we will apply the methodology presented in section [ sec : cpe ] to reconstruct the 2010 , 2011 and 2012 od matrix according to the barrier counts . \n the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are then calculated , and the reconstruction of the ferry passengers are presented in figs . \n [ fig : est1 ] and [ fig : est2 ] . \n we presented in this paper a new estimation technique for the od matrix . \n we use the information available from surveys to infer the correct projection matrix and reduce significantly the size of the parameter space . by using a maximum likelihood approach , \n we compute the estimating equations and provide an ad hoc estimator of the od matrix . \n we demonstrated its robustness in section [ sec : rob ] . \n + we also demonstrated that a regression analysis could be performed on this kind of data , and showed that this estimation procedure is also consistent . to the best of our knowledge , \n this is the first time that a such multivariate approach is used to estimate the od matrix . \n this approach will improve the prediction ability of passengers journeys . \n + we finally applied our techniques to simulated data and real - case scenario in sydney ferry transport using the data from the bureau of transport statistics . + the estimation of the od matrix is a first step for the analysis of the passengers flow over the transport network . \n then , beyond this estimation point , we may cite :    1 . \n [ monit ] monitoring the passengers count ; 2 .   [ forecast ] forecasting of the passengers count ( 1 week in advance for example ) ; 3 . \n [ predict ] predicting the passengers flow in case of spatio - temporal topological change in the network    in order to address the monitoring task ( [ monit ] ) , several strong assumptions have to be made , which will require ground verifications before being tested . among them \n , we can cite the time between ticket validation and getting into the train or the regularity at which people take their train if they are regular passengers . \n moreover , a real - time access to the data is necessary . \n while difficult , this seems achievable . \n + the forecasting of passenger counts ( [ forecast ] ) can be done without additional information ( if sufficient temporal information has been provided in a first place ) , even if more observation would probably mean smaller variances . \n these forecasts could be helpful for efficient scheduling the trains ( for example ) , but further study have to be done in order to understand the influence of complex variables such as the temperature or the humidity . \n + real - time prediction of passenger flows ( [ predict ] ) is more difficult , but is theoretically achievable . \n what we denote a spatio - temporal topological change is a change in the timetable , or in the public transport route .                                            _ to make it clear , we will explore a simple density example , where the poisson distribution will be used instead of the negative binomial . \n therefore , the pdf can be expressed as , @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the parameter we are interested in . \n then , if we make the assumption that the number of passengers in every station are independent , each @xmath145 is distributed according to a poisson distribution , with the parameter @xmath146 , which can be re - written according to eq . \n [ eq : diag2 ] , @xmath147 where the @xmath148 are the eigenvalues , and the @xmath149 the element of the matrix p. if we denote @xmath150 , the transformed density can then be written , @xmath151 + therefore , the log - likelihood can be expressed as follow , @xmath152 the maximum likelihood estimation is then equivalent to solve the following system , @xmath153 still under the constraint * c1 * and * c2*. * c3 * is excluded because this set of parameter does nt exist in the poisson modelling . if @xmath154 , @xmath155 and * c2 * does nt stand . \n then estimated value corresponds to the classical one dimensional poisson unbiased mean estimator @xmath156 . \n + the system of equations [ eq : sys_pois ] seems at first a quite complicated one . \n nevertheless , it can be simplify so as to become , @xmath157 where @xmath158 contains the unknown parameters . then , if we denote @xmath159 , then , @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 . then \n , we can keep simplifying the expression , @xmath163 finally , the same reasoning leads to the following estimator , @xmath164 where @xmath165 . \n this estimator will probably not be the best estimator given that it relies on the inversion of @xmath166 , but has the advantage to be asymptotically unbiased , with variance decreasing to zero . \n _      _ let @xmath167 be a probability density function . if @xmath168 denotes the pdf of @xmath169 , and @xmath170 the pdf of @xmath100 , we can write , @xmath171 let consider the estimator presented in eq . \n [ eq : linsol_lamfg ] , and make the assumption that we are in a large value case , meaning @xmath172 . \n then , @xmath173 where , @xmath174 \\tilde{s}_d^{-1 } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] and @xmath100 is an estimation of @xmath48 according to the first observations . \n +   + _      to prove the convergence in probability , we need to demonstrate that , @xmath175 where @xmath176 . \n starting with the left hand side , we have , @xmath177 and we know that @xmath178{\\ a.s.\\ } p s_d \\lambda $ ] . then , @xmath179 and we have , @xmath180 where @xmath181 stands for the probability density function of @xmath182 . \n + the first integral decreases towards @xmath183 as @xmath57 grows to infinity according to eq . \n [ eq : as ] . \n the argument for the second integral is the following . according to the assumption of strong convergence of @xmath100 , @xmath181 \n converge towards the dirac function @xmath184 as @xmath185 goes to infinity . \n @xmath186 being strictly positive , this ends the proof . @xmath187 .

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the estimation of the origin-destination (OD) matrix, crucial for analyzing transportation systems, particularly in public transport. The OD matrix estimates passenger or freight movement between different zones within a region, which is often challenging and expensive to obtain through direct measurements. This study focuses on innovative estimation methods using ticket records and survey data, aiming to refine the accuracy of these estimates in the context of public transport systems like CityRail in Sydney. It proposes a robust estimation method that considers various factors, including exogenous variables like weather and time variations, and enhances the estimation procedure using regression analysis. The approach uses maximum likelihood estimation and regression models to develop a comprehensive and accurate estimation of the OD matrix, potentially improving public transport management and planning."

coupled reflected field is composed of the uncorrelated sidebands within the linewidth and the reflected correlated sidebands outside of it . \n the consequence is the destruction of the correlation within the linewidth between the upper and lower quantum sidebands . \n this is analogous to the destruction of the correlation between electro - optically modulated coherent sidebands in pairs , in which the beat between the carrier and the upper or lower sideband can be measured only when either sideband is absorbed into the cavity , reflecting the carrier and other sideband . \n the beat could not be observed if all the fields were reflected . \n similar measurements could be done with the transmission of the squeezed vacuum field through the cavity . \n however , the signal - to - noise ratio would not be as good as in the reflection method because the background of the transmission signal is shot noise . \n it is convenient to define the test cavity linewidth @xmath83 , the quality factor @xmath0 , and the finesse @xmath84 , as @xmath85 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq & \\frac{1-\\sqrt{r_1r_2r_3}}{\\pi(r_1 r_2 r_3)^{1/4}}\\,\\omega_{\\rm fsr},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively . \n the approximations made in eqs . and are valid for high q cavities . \n @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath22 , and @xmath38 will be treated as free fitting parameters . \n we also assume the input mirror is lossless such that @xmath90 .      since we are interested in having as little light ( at the carrier frequency ) as possible in the test cavity , it is instructive to calculate the average photon number in the field we use . \n the average photon number in squeezed light with squeeze factor @xmath91 and squeeze angle @xmath92 is given by @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the coherent amplitude of the light . \n as the number of coherent photons becomes zero ( @xmath95 ) , resulting in squeezed vacuum , eq . \n becomes @xmath96 this is the average photon number in squeezed vacuum generated by squeezing . \n note that if the field is unsqueezed ( @xmath97 ) , @xmath98 . \n for a squeeze factor of 1.5 corresponding to the squeezed or anti - squeezed level of @xmath99  db which is the current experimental limit @xcite , @xmath100 . \n therefore , it is fair to say that the optical influence of ideal squeezed vacuum on cavities is negligible .     and @xmath101 are shown as solid and dashed curves , respectively , for different input states . \n ( a ) and ( b ) show the ( impure ) input state with @xmath102 db and @xmath103 db , _ in the absence of the cavity_.

[ setup ] . \n the nd : yag laser ( lightwave model 126 ) gives an output of cw 700 mw at 1064 nm , which is injected into the squeezed vacuum generator ( squeezer ) . \n the squeezer is composed of a second harmonic generator ( shg ) and an optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) , both using 5@xmath126 mgo : linbo@xmath29 nonlinear crystals placed within optical cavities ( hemilith for the shg and monolith for the opo ) in the type i phase - matching configuration . \n the shg pumped by the nd : yag laser generates 250 mw at 532 nm , which then pumps the opo below threshold with a vacuum seed . \n the resultant field generated by the opo is a squeezed vacuum field with a squeezing bandwidth of 66.2 mhz defined by the opo cavity linewidth . \n a sub - carrier field , frequency - shifted by an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) to a frequency that is coincident with the cavity tem@xmath127 mode , is injected into the other end of the opo cavity . the cavity is thus locked to the tem@xmath127 mode , offset by 220 mhz from the carrier frequency , using the pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) locking technique @xcite . \n the frequency - shift is necessary to ensure that no cavity transmitted light at the fundamental frequency is injected into the opo cavity since it acts as a seed and degrades broadband squeezing due to the imperfect isolation of the faraday isolator @xcite . \n this is especially important for high q cavities with linewidths as narrow as khz because low - frequency squeezing is difficult to achieve . \n the squeezed vacuum is injected into a triangular test cavity with the fsr of 713 mhz and fwhm of @xmath2 khz , both measured by traditional methods using light . \n the frequency shift , of the subcarrier is @xmath128 mhz so that the carrier frequency is detuned from the tem@xmath129 mode by @xmath130 mhz . as a result of this frequency shift , \n only the upper sidebands are within the cavity linewidth , destroying the correlation between the upper and lower sidebands and , therefore , destroying the squeezing or anti - squeezing . \n this cavity - coupled squeezed vacuum reflection is measured by balanced homodyne detection , where the field to be measured interferes with a local oscillator ( lo ) field and is detected by two ( nearly ) identical photodetectors . \n the difference of the two photodetector signals is sent to an hp4195a spectrum analyzer ( sa ) to measure the noise variance of the squeezed or anti - squeezed quadrature . \n the results are shown in fig . \n [ linewidth ] . \n the experimental data are exponentially averaged 100 times . \n the resolution bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer is 100 khz . \n since the squeezed vacuum does not carry any coherent amplitude , the noise - locking technique @xcite is employed to lock the homodyne angle to either the squeezed or anti - squeezed quadrature at 2 mhz . \n khz . ]    before fitting the experimental data points , the homodyne efficiencies @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and the quantum efficiency of the photo - detectors @xmath133 need to be taken into account . the sum of the homodyne efficiencies and the quantum efficiency were independently measured to be @xmath134 and @xmath135 respectively . the sum of the efficiencies @xmath136 in eq . is given by @xmath137 . \n we ignore @xmath132 since the cavity mode - matching efficiency is @xmath138 and hence @xmath139 , which yields @xmath140 . \n moreover , we have assumed that the input mirror m@xmath141 is lossless . \n this assumption is valid since it is a single - pass loss and does not influence the linewidth of the cavity . \n we then fit eq . to the measured data points with free parameters @xmath88,@xmath142 , and @xmath22 ; both the data and the fits are shown in fig . \n [ linewidth ] . \n the resulting fitting values are @xmath143 , and @xmath144 mhz . \n therefore , the fwhm linewidth of the cavity is found to be @xmath145 khz , which agrees with the classically measured linewidth of the cavity within the uncertainty ( @xmath2 khz ) . \n we note that @xmath38 can be determined from the fit , but here we have used the optically measured value to estimate the linewidth . \n this is valid because any loss in the cavity does not change the fsr . \n we have proposed and experimentally demonstrated a method for non - invasive measurements of optical cavity parameters by use of squeezed vacuum . \n the technique has the advantage over traditional optical methods that the injection of a squeezed vacuum field as a probe for cavity parameters does not excite any nonlinear processes in cavities , and is , therefore , useful for ultrahigh q cavities such as whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) cavities . \n we have shown that when a squeezed vacuum field is injected into a detuned cavity , the linewidth and @xmath0 factor of a test cavity can be determined by measuring the destruction of upper and lower quantum sidebands with respect to the carrier frequency . \n the linewidth of a test cavity is measured to be @xmath146 khz , which agrees with the classically measured linewidth of the cavity within the uncertainty ( @xmath147 khz ) . \n we have also show that the use of squeezed fields leads to better signal contrast , as expected . \n we would like to thank our colleagues at the ligo laboratory , especially thomas corbitt and christopher wipf , and stan whitcomb for his valuable comments on the manuscript . \n we gratefully acknowledge support from national science foundation grant nos . \n phy-0107417 and phy-0457264 .",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel method for measuring the quality factors (Q) of high-Q optical cavities using squeezed vacuum fields. High-Q cavities, like those based on whispering gallery modes, face challenges in accurately measuring Q due to nonlinear processes induced by high intensities within the cavities. The proposed method involves injecting a squeezed vacuum field into the cavity, which does not excite nonlinear responses, and measuring the Q factor by observing the correlation destruction between quantum sidebands. This technique provides a non-invasive and potentially more accurate measurement method compared to traditional optical methods, making it suitable for ultra-high-Q cavities where nonlinear effects are significant."

        "article": "to enhance chemical reactivity of cu surfaces with nitrogen oxides ( no@xmath0 ) is an important issue for development of new catalytic materials effective in the no@xmath0 reduction process @xcite . \n the dissociative adsorption of no@xmath0 , for example , was found to be less expected on cu , compared with highly reactive rh , ir , ru , co , and ni surfaces , although dissociative adsorption was reported at finite temperatures in experiments @xcite . in order to provide active surfaces for no dissociation , \n cu thin films and low index surfaces were considered on one hand @xcite . in several electronic structure calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) , on the other hand , dissociative adsorption of no was found to be possible but energetically un - favored compared with molecular adsorption @xcite . \n we note that the simulations were often performed with respect to reactions on stable bulk surfaces . \n although the theoretical data suggested less reactivity of cu bulk surfaces for no@xmath0 reduction , there could be remarkable reactivity on some surface - like atomic structures of cu . \n when we considered wider classes of nano - scale structures other than defined surfaces of bulk cu crystals , one could find another clue . in this line of approach , indeed , many theoretical investigations with computer simulations had been done intending to explore efficiency of _ \n e.g. _ step - like structures of various metals @xcite .    to explore possible no dissociation , we consider ultra thin cu structures . in this study , we focus on a cu atomic layer , that is the triangular lattice of cu . \n we adopted structural optimization simulations based on electronic structure calculations to find a stable cu triangular lattice ( cu - tl ) . on this thin structure \n , we adsorbed an no molecule and performed an optimization simulation . after finding molecular adsorbed structures , we searched possible dissociative adsorption on the cu structures . to find a possible reaction path and to conclude a reduction process , we performed simulations for reaction path estimation . in the discussion of this paper , by comparing the obtained adsorption energies with each other \n , we will discuss a possible no@xmath0 reduction mechanism by using cu nano - structures . \n we adopted the electronic structure calculation based on the density functional theory@xcite to estimate the electronic state , and to obtain inter - atomic forces . in this simulation , \n the kohn - sham wavefunctions were expanded in the plane - waves and the electron charge density was given both on a real space mesh and on the fourier mesh . \n an approximation for the exchange - correlation energy functional by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof@xcite in the scheme of the generalized gradient approximation was adopted . \n the ultra - soft pseudo - potential@xcite was utilized to describe the valence electron state . \n all of our simulations were done using the simulation package , the quantum espresso @xcite . \n the calculation conditions are summarized as follows . the energy cut - off for the wave function expansion was 30 [ ry ] , while the cut - off for the charge density was 240 [ ry ] . \n the brillouin zone integration was done using a @xmath1 mesh of 8@xmath28@xmath21 for the largest super cell adopted . \n these values were refined , if the computation facility allowed much accurate calculations . \n the convergence criterion for the force constant was that the simulation ended , when the absolute value of the total force vector became less than 1@xmath210@xmath3 [ ry / a.u . ] . \n to explore possible high reactivity of cu nano - structures , we considered atomic - layer structures . an important structure for our discussion is the cu triangular lattice ( cu - tl ) . in this section , \n we show data for structural and electronic properties of cu - tl . \n we obtained an optimized lattice structure using a cu atomic layer in a primitive super cell . \n major calculation conditions were the same as those given in section [ methods ] . \n the @xmath1-point mesh was 24@xmath224@xmath21 in this simulation . \n the cell was given in a hexagonal structure . \n the vacuum layer had thickness of 15  . in this simulation , \n the value of the lattice constant was optimized . \n the bond length was found to be 2.43  . \n [ fig : cu - tl - ene - a ] ) this value is rather small compared to the bond length 2.55 of the bulk fcc cu . \n the reason for shrink in the bond length is mainly to reduce the total band energy . \n the total energy of tl was energetically higher than the bulk cu by 1.2 ev per a cu atom .     of the triangular lattice of cu . \n the value of @xmath4 in rydberg is given as a function of the lattice constant @xmath5[ ] . , height=302 ]    starting from some initial conditions , we found appearance of cu - tl in optimized structures . \n as another evidence to show the local stability of cu - tl , we considered an atomic two - layer structure ( atls ) . \n this structure was obtained by cutting the bulk fcc cu crystal and was placed in a simulation super - cell . \n the layer structure was perpendicular to the ( 100 ) direction of bulk cu and thus was contained in an orthorhombic unit cell . \n energy difference between atls and cu - tl was 3.11 ev per a cu atom . \n an optimization calculation of the structure concluded local stability . \n but , atls was not kept against global reconstruction which was happened when an no molecule was adsorbed on it . \n furthermore , we found a strongly reacted structure starting from an no molecule adsorbed on atls . \n it means that using atls as an initial structure , naively speaking , we realized simulated annealing in our simulation . \n compared with this un - stable structure , cu - tl was found to be stable . \n once the molecule was adsorbed on atls , reconstruction of atls happened and formation of cu - tl was observed in our simulations . \n conversely , we can say that cu - tl is stable against distortion making corrugation toward atls . \n even when one observed local stability of an atomic structure in simulation , however , a final evidence of the structure would be requested to be given using real experiments . \n realization of an atomically thin layer , _ \n i.e. _ cu - tl , will need development of a fabrication method . \n recently , formation of an atomic layer of pb on the si(111 ) surface was reported @xcite . in this superconducting pb system , \n positions of pb atoms are affected by the atomic structure of the substrate and inter - atomic distance between pb atoms is not determined independently from the substrate . \n the most remarkable example of natural realization of the atomic layer is graphene @xcite . \n this unique flexible structure of carbon is possible to be supported in air according to the strong c - c sp@xmath6 bonding . peeling a graphene sheet and pasting it on a silicon - di - oxide surface \n , graphene is obtained efficiently from graphite .    in case of cu \n , we may expect formation of an atomic layer on a suitable inert substrate \n . we might be able to keep the atomic layer as a film pasted on a support with a nano - meter - scale hole . \n then , mechanical properties of the atomic layer would be paid attention like a graphene sheet @xcite . \n but for our consideration of no adsorption , a local structure of cu is important . \n so , we assume an atomic - scale local structure in a part of nano - scale cu .      the density of states ( dos ) of cu - tl is shown in fig . \n [ fig : cu111 - 1-tetra ] . \n the major peaks are characterized similarly to the bulk copper . \n looking dos from the low energy region , we see that the 4s band starts from -6.38 ev and spreads over above the fermi energy . \n sharp peaks of 3d levels are seen from -4.04 ev but the 3d bands end below the fermi level . \n thus , parfectly filled 3d band with the @xmath7 configuration is kept and the structure behaves as an @xmath8 metal . \n these characteristic features are seen in the electronic band structure of cu - tl , too . \n [ fig : cu-2d - band ] ) along the @xmath9-m line , or the k-@xmath9 line , we see hybridization of the 4s band and a 3d band . \n comparison with the cu ( 111 ) surface allows us to evaluate similarity and difference between cu - tl and the bulk cu surface . \n the density of states in the 4s band leveled almost around 0.2 owing to two - dimensional nature . \n dos in the 3d bands peaked well above 10 for cu - tl in the unit of states / ev per a unit cell , while the value is from 4 to 6 , except for a singularity at the top of the 3d bands , for the cu ( 111 ) surface . \n the shorter bond length of cu atoms , the height in dos should be lower in a fixed lattice structure . \n thus , the higher dos peak for cu - tl than for the bulk cu suggests that two - dimensional nature of cu - tl affects dos . \n since dos at the fermi level is almost the same for both cu - tl and the cu ( 111 ) surface , the chemical reactivity of no is expected to be similar , if the structure is kept undeformed . \n however , we should note that the top of cu 3d bands is much closer to the fermi energy for cu - tl than the cu ( 111 ) surface . \n this tendency suggests higher reactivity of cu - tl against no . \n when the stable adsorption site is the on - top site , similarity in characteristic energy like the adsorption energy would be expected . however , if a bridge site or a hollow site became stable for no on cu - tl , we could have difference even in the chemical reactivity from that on the cu ( 111 ) surface . \n this is because much easy deformation of the cu network structure is expected for cu - tl and the bond formation between no and cu - tl will create distortion . in the next section , \n we discuss occurrence of strong reactions between no and cu - tl . \n we consider adsorption of no on cu - tl and an atomic step like structure ( ass ) created on an cu atomic layer . \n the second structure was found in optimization simulations of no adsorption on atls . observing results of no - adsorbed structures starting from atls \n , we identified a stable substrate structure in a super cell as cu - tl with ass in our simulations . \n therefore , we regarded cu - tl and ass as typical atomic - scale layer structures of cu . \n several characteristic adsorption sites for no were found on these structures . \n molecular adsorbed structures were obtained by structural optimization . \n starting from an initial structure with a no molecule a little separated from a substrate , cu - tl , ass or atls , each adsorbed structure was determined . by a series of simulations \n , we found the next general rules for molecular adsorption . on cu - tl , adsorption on a hollow site \n is energetically most favorable . on ass , \n a bridge site on the cu array is energetically most favorable among sites including an on - top site , a hollow site in the back surface , and a bridge site in the back surface . \n thus , we treat these locally stable structures only in the following discussion . \n while , structures corresponding to dissociative adsorption were given by locating n and o atoms a little separated on the substrate and by optimizing the whole structure . \n we have found two locally stable dissociative adsorbed structures on cu - tl and on ass . \n the structures are depicted in fig . \n [ fig : ss - sideview ] . as typical structures \n , we consider these structures only . \n we define the adsorption energy by the next formula . \n @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the molecular adsorption energy , while @xmath12 is the dissociative adsorption energy . \n the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the total energy of a cu slab with no and that of another slab with a n atom and an o atom adsorbed on the cu slab , @xmath15 is the total energy of a cu slab without no , and @xmath16 is the total energy of the no molecule contained in a super cell with the same size as the other calculations . \n molecular dissociation energy is defined as , @xmath17    adsorbed structures found in our simulations are itemized in the next list . \n the adsorption energy is also shown in each parenthesis for convenience . \n molecular adsorption on cu - tl : :    in adsorption of a no molecule on a surface of cu - tl , a hollow site    ( -0.83 ev ) is selected . \n see the center figure of    fig . \n [ fig : ss - sideview ] ( a ) . \n molecular adsorption on ass : :    in adsorption of a no molecule on an atomic step - like structure , a    bridge site ( -1.32 ev ) is selected . \n see the center figure of    fig . \n [ fig : ss - sideview ] ( b ) . \n dissociative adsorption : :    dissociative adsorption of no is found on tl ( -1.92 ev ) and on ass    ( -1.69 ev ) . \n see the right figures of fig . \n [ fig : ss - sideview ] ( a ) and    ( b ) . \n now , dissociative adsorption structures are discussed . \n we have two typical dissociative adsorption structures on cu - tl and on ass . in the first structure , \n the nitrogen atom locates at a center of five surrounding cu atoms . \n ( see the right figures of fig .  [ \n fig : ss - sideview ] ( a ) . ) \n this structure may be regarded as a nitrogen interstitial impurity in a cu lattice . \n arrangement of cu is largely distorted from pure tl , so that the n atom is embedded in cu layer . \n the oxygen atom locates at a hollow site and it is embedded in cu layer . \n the local structure of these impurity sites are ncu@xmath18 and ocu@xmath19 . here \n , the ocu@xmath19 structure is planer . \n a reason for appearance of the high coordination numbers for n and o is that cu valence is not largely modified and that 3d@xmath20 configuration is almost kept . \n 4s electrons are in extended states so that the local n@xmath3 and o@xmath21 are efficiently screened by neighboring five and four copper atoms .    on ss \n , we have another dissociative adsorbed structure for no . \n the nitrogen atom is again embedded in the cu structure . \n ( see the right figure of fig . \n [ fig : ss - sideview ] ( b ) . ) in this structure , the oxygen atom is at a bridge site and keeps two - fold coordination , while the nitrogen atom has four - fold coordination . \n now we compare the obtained values of adsorption energy with those in the literature . the molecular adsorption energy is higher for ass than those on cu - tl . except for a case of a bond - center site on the back surface of ass \n , molecular adsorption favors the bridge site of the step - like structure . \n this general tendency is natural in comparison to the other examples known in the literature . \n the most notable feature of our results is the finding of the large dissociative adsorption energy . \n we conclude that the dissociative adsorption may happen , when the nitrogen atom can go to an interstitial site of a cu structure . \n the large value of @xmath12 ( -1.92 ev on tl and -1.69 ev on ass ) is actually possible , since these structures possess high coordination of cu around the nitrogen atom .    on the clean cu ( 111 ) surface , \n no favors the molecular adsorption ( with the adsorption energy of -1.22 ev estimated in ref . \n @xcite ) against the dissociation of no , where the dissociative adsorption energy is estimated to be -0.79 ev in ref . @xcite . \n the qualitative difference between data for known bulk surfaces and our result should be attributed on movement of cu atoms in the reconstruction process . in our simulation , \n positions of cu atoms are rather easily modified because the atomic structure of cu is just a single layer . even in the optimization simulation \n , we can reach the nitrogen insertion in the cu structures .    from the present result , \n we conjecture the following picture . \n if a cu structure allows large configurational distortion owing to the chemical reaction with no , the nitrogen atom can move into the cu structure and form the local ncu@xmath22 configuration . \n ( @xmath23 or 5 . ) owing to the energy reduction coming from the large formation energy of the local ncu@xmath22 structure , we can expect even the dissociative adsorption of no on cu . in the real cu nano - structures \n , there can happen large distortion of cu configuration owing to finite temperatures and possible local strain . \n therefore , our simulation , which is prepared using the atomic layer of cu , might have derived a hidden possible path of the no dissociative adsorption on cu structures .      to estimate a reaction path on the no reduction on cu - tl \n , we estimated the local structure and the energy of a transition state using the nudged - elastic - band method . \n the initial configuration was the molecular adsorbed structure on cu - tl and the final configuration was the dissociative adsorbed structure obtained in \n [ ads - structure ] . \n the dissociation reaction was determined by obtaining the transition state with an energy @xmath24 for the no reduction process . \n the activation energy for dissociation of no on the atomic layer is estimated using the next definition . \n @xmath25 an upper bound of the transition potential barrier is estimated to be 1.4 ev . in the initial state , \n the no molecule adsorbed on cu - tl with the nitrogen atom binding to the cu surface . in the transition state , \n the oxygen atom had local bond connections with surrounding cu atoms to reduce the total energy . to form this distorted structure in the transition state , \n the whole cu atomic configuration were optimized , creating drastic change in cu - tl . \n utilizing the dft - gga simulations , we have shown that no dissociative adsorption may happen on an atomic cu layer , which is the triangular lattice of cu atoms ( cu - tl ) . \n the reactivity of cu - tl against molecular adsorption of no was found to be similar to the cu(111 ) surface . \n some stable sites for no were found to give molecular adsorption . \n however , our optimization simulation revealed that there was a co - adsorbed structure of n and o atoms , which was energetically stabler by 1.08ev than the molecular adsorbed cu - tl structure . \n a reaction path estimation showed existence of a path with an energy barrier of 1.4ev . \n thus , we may conclude molecular dissociation of no on the cu atomic layer . \n the large dissociation energy appears owing to formation of local n - cu or o - cu bondings and creation of local n - cu@xmath26 and o - cu@xmath22 structures . \n we further considered an atomic step - like structure ( ass ) of cu , which was an atomic - scale wrinkle in the cu - tl structure . \n the absolute value of the molecular adsorption energy on the step was larger than the values found for cu - bulk surfaces or cu - tl . \n our simulation revealed that there existed a dissociative adsorbed structure in which a nitrogen impurity site embedded in a cu structure was created . \n the estimated dissociation energy of no became -0.37 ev on ass . \n flexibility against modification of this cu atomic structure in the nano - meter scale is decisive both to stabilize dissociative adsorption of no and to reduce the energy barrier on the no - reduction path . \n catalytic activity of cu to reduce no should appear on the atomically flexible cu networks . \n therefore , in order to realize cu - based no@xmath0 reduction catalysts , it is important to create atomic structures of cu , _ \n i.e. _ atomic layers , atomic scale clusters , and atomic scale networks , which allow conformational change . \n this work was supported by the elements science and technology project and also by grant -

  "abstract": "This paper investigates the potential for enhanced chemical reactivity of copper (Cu) surfaces with nitrogen oxides (NOx) for effective NOx reduction in catalytic processes. It focuses on the dissociative adsorption of NO on ultra-thin Cu structures, particularly Cu atomic layers in a triangular lattice (Cu-TL), which are theoretically studied using density functional theory (DFT). The study reveals that while bulk Cu surfaces exhibit limited reactivity, nano-scale Cu structures, especially Cu-TL, might show enhanced reactivity due to their unique atomic configurations. The paper discusses the stability of these structures, their electronic properties, and potential reaction paths for NO dissociation, suggesting that Cu nano-structures could be promising candidates for catalytic NOx reduction."

  "abstract": "This paper explores the hypothesis that ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) around the 'ankle' energy region are predominantly extragalactic protons. The study discusses the interaction of these protons with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which limits their propagation through processes like photopion production, resulting in the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff. Despite expectations of a decline in the cosmic ray spectrum beyond this cutoff, observations suggest a continuation, possibly indicating sources within 50 megaparsecs. The paper also speculates on alternative sources such as decaying superheavy particles or dark matter. It further examines the role of cosmogenic neutrinos, which could arise from these interactions, and their potential to contribute to the observed UHECRs, assuming enhanced neutrino-nucleon interactions. The analysis utilizes data from AGASA and HiRes cosmic ray detectors and discusses future prospects with the Pierre Auger Observatory."

        "article": "a multistable system is one that possesses a large number of coexisting attractors for a fixed set of parameters . \n there is ample evidence for such phenomena in the natural sciences , with examples coming from neurosciences and neural dynamics @xcite - @xcite , optics @xcite @xcite , chemistry @xcite @xcite @xcite , condensed matter @xcite and geophysics @xcite . \n multistability also seems to be an essential complexity - generating mechanism in a large class of agent - based models @xcite .    in view of this \n , it is important to identify the dynamical mechanisms leading to multistability and , in particular , to construct simple models where this phenomenon might be under control . \n the first mathematical result in this direction was obtained by newhouse @xcite \n @xcite @xcite who proved that , near a homoclinic tangency , a class of diffeomorphisms in a two - dimensional manifold has infinitely many attracting periodic orbits ( sinks ) , a result that was later extended to higher dimensions @xcite . \n it has also been proved @xcite that , in addition to infinitely many sinks , infinitely many strange attractors exist near the homoclinic tangencies . \n the stability of the phenomena under small random perturbations has been studied @xcite @xcite . \n a second dynamical mechanism leading to multistability is the addition of small dissipative perturbations to conservative systems . \n conservative systems have a large number of coexisting invariant sets , namely periodic orbits , invariant tori and cantori . by adding a small amount of dissipation to a conservative system one finds that some of the invariant sets become attractors \n . not all invariant sets of the conservative system will survive when the dissipation is added . however , for sufficiently small dissipation , many attractors ( mainly periodic orbits ) have been observed in typical systems @xcite @xcite @xcite . \n the problem of migration between attractors and their stability in multiple - attractor systems has also been studied by other authors @xcite @xcite . \n most of results are based on numerical evidence . however , using the techniques of deformation stability @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite some rigorous mathematical results @xcite may be obtained . \n finally , it has been found recently @xcite that , for parameter values near the feigenbaum period - doubling accumulation point , quadratic maps coupled by convex coupling may have a large number of stable periodic orbits . \n this is one of the phenomena we study in detail in this paper . \n the emphasis on quadratic maps near the feigenbaum accumulation point has a motivation close to the idea of control of chaos @xcite @xcite . \n the typical situation in control of chaos , is that of a strange attractor with an infinite number of embedded periodic orbits , all of them unstable . \n these orbits are then stabilized by several methods . if , instead of a large number of unstable periodic orbits , one has , for example , a large number of sinks , the controlling situation would seem more promising and robust , because the control need not be so accurate \n . it would suffice to keep the system inside the desired basin of attraction . at the period - doubling accumulation point the feigenbaum attractor , because of the properties of the flip bifurcations , coexists with an infinite set of unstable periodic orbits . by coupling , as we will show , an arbitrarily large number of orbits may become stable . \n the existence of a large number of stable periodic orbits for just two coupled quadratic maps , provides a simple model where multistability is well under control , in the sense that not only the nature of the phenomenon is completely understood as one may also compute the range of parameters that provides any desired number of stable orbits . \n this should be contrasted , for example , with concrete models for the newhouse phenomenon @xcite .    rather than merely focusing on multistability \n , we also study the phenomenology of two coupled quadratic maps , in particular the bifurcations of periodic orbits and the regime of synchronization .. the stabilization of orbits in the coupled system is similar to that obtained in higher dimensional coupled map lattices @xcite with the exception that , due to the restricted dimension of the phase space , the types of bifurcations are different in our system . the results concerning the multistability phenomenon at @xmath0 also considerably extend , and also correct , some imprecise statements in @xcite . \n coupled map lattices ( cml ) are discrete dynamical systems generated by the composition of a local nonlinearity and a coupling . \n the phase space of the cml considered in this letter is the square @xmath1^{2}$ ] and the dynamics is generated by the map @xmath2 defined as follows . given a point @xmath3 , its image by @xmath2 , denoted @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . \n the map @xmath9 maps @xmath1 $ ] into itself . \n therefore , the convex combination in ( [ def ] ) ensures that @xmath10^{2})\\subset [ -1,1]^{2}$ ] and the dynamics is well - defined . \n we denote the orbit issued from the initial condition @xmath11 by the sequence @xmath12 , that is to say , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for all @xmath15 .    for the sake of simplicity \n , we will often employ the variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 . \n the previous notation of orbits also applies to these variables for which relation ( [ def ] ) becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 . \n finally , note that the dynamics commutes with the symmetry @xmath20 or @xmath21 in the original variables . \n if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in this case , the orbit is said to be synchronized ( from @xmath25 on ) . \n more generally , an orbit is said to synchronize if @xmath26 and if all orbits synchronize , then we say to have synchronization of the map . \n synchronization is the simplest dynamical regime exhibited by two - dimensional cml .    to determine a sufficient condition for synchronization in our system \n , we note that for any orbit , one has @xmath27 for all @xmath15 . \n it follows from ( [ def2 ] ) that the condition @xmath28 ensures an exponential decay of @xmath29 , and hence synchronization .. since @xmath30 , the condition @xmath28 is equivalent to the following ones ( see figure 1 ) . \n @xmath31    from now on , we assume that @xmath32 . \n the condition @xmath33 is not necessary . indeed , \n if for instance @xmath34 , then @xmath9 has an attracting fixed point in @xmath1 $ ] , and one can prove that synchronization occurs . \n when @xmath35 is sufficiently small , this happens even though @xmath36 . \n starting from synchronization and modifying the parameters , non - synchronized ( periodic ) orbits appear from bifurcations of synchronized ( periodic ) ones . to understand this phenomenon , as well as the bifurcations of subsequent orbits , \n we now study analytically the periodic orbits of period 1 and 2 . \n let @xmath37 be the synchronized fixed point denoted in @xmath38-variables . \n it exists for any values of the parameters and @xmath2 has no other fixed point in @xmath1^{2}$ ] . in @xmath38-variables , \n the jacobian of @xmath39 at this fixed point is diagonal . \n one eigenvalue is @xmath40 and the corresponding eigendirection is the diagonal @xmath41 . \n the other eigenvalue is @xmath42 and the corresponding direction , orthogonal to the diagonal is referred as the anti - diagonal . \n the condition @xmath43 then determines a period - doubling bifurcation , which is of co - dimension 1 if @xmath44 . \n this is the well - known period - doubling bifurcation of @xmath9 which creates a synchronized period-2 orbit of @xmath2 . \n moreover , one checks that the derivative @xmath45 is negative for any @xmath46 . \n hence the conditions @xmath44 and @xmath47 , i.e.   @xmath48 determine another co - dimension 1 period - doubling bifurcation of the synchronized fixed point . \n indeed the conditions of the corresponding bifurcation theorem ( see e.g.  @xcite ) are satisfied when the curve @xmath49 is crossed upward .    the period-2 orbit created at this \n bifurcation is non - synchronized and symmetric . to show this , \n denote by @xmath50 and @xmath51 its components . since the multiplier @xmath42 is negative and \n the bifurcating direction is the anti - diagonal , we have @xmath52 ( sufficiently close to the bifurcation ) . \n because of the @xmath53 symmetry , the map @xmath2 also has a period-2 orbit with components @xmath54 and @xmath55 . consequently if @xmath56 , the system would have two periodic orbits created by a co - dimension 1 bifurcation . \n this is impossible by the unicity in the bifurcation theorem . \n therefore , sufficiently close to the bifurcation , we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 which is the desired conclusion .    by continuity in the parameters of @xmath2 , sufficiently close to the bifurcation , \n this symmetric orbit is stable with respect to perturbations in one direction ( the anti - diagonal direction at the bifurcation ) and since @xmath59 , it is unstable in the direction orthogonal to the latter . \n the bifurcations will now be computed . \n the orbit with @xmath60 and @xmath58 exists for any @xmath61 and is the unique ( up to time translations ) period-2 non - synchronized symmetric orbit of @xmath2 in @xmath1^{2}$ ] . \n computing the corresponding jacobian , one obtains the equation for the multipliers @xmath62 \\lambda + \\left ( 1 - 2\\varepsilon \\right ) ^{2}(s^{2}-d^{2})^{2}=0\\ ] ] where @xmath63 direct calculations show that , if @xmath64 , the multipliers , say @xmath65 and @xmath66 , have zero imaginary part iff @xmath67 . under this condition \n , we have @xmath68 if @xmath69 and @xmath70 iff @xmath71 . \n ( the inequality @xmath72 indeed holds if @xmath73 and @xmath74 , see figure 1 . ) \n consequently , by increasing @xmath46 , the symmetric orbit suffers an inverse pitchfork bifurcation at @xmath75 \n . this bifurcation is generic for a symmetric orbit in a system with symmetry @xcite and the conditions of the bifurcation theorem hold when the curve @xmath76 is crossed upward . \n this bifurcation creates two non - symmetric period-2 orbits ( one orbit and its symmetric ) . \n we have checked that these orbits exist for any @xmath77 and @xmath78 . for @xmath79 , \n their components are combinations of a fixed point of @xmath9 and the components of a period-2 orbit .    when the imaginary part of @xmath80 and @xmath81 is not zero , we have @xmath82 . \n ( once again , if @xmath73 and @xmath83 , the inequality @xmath84 is satisfied , see figure 1 . ) \n the symmetric orbit is thus stable in the interval @xmath85 . \n if @xmath44 and the curve @xmath86 is crossed upward , this orbit suffers a hopf bifurcation creating a locally stable invariant circle . \n a numerical calculation shows that the latter is destroyed when @xmath46 is sufficiently large or when @xmath87 is sufficiently small . obviously , \n if @xmath79 , it does not exist and the bifurcation at @xmath88 which is a period - doubling bifurcation of @xmath9 creates a period-4 orbit .    note that invariant circles in two - dimensional cml resulting from the destabilization of a symmetric orbit and their normal form had already been reported in @xcite . in that work , the system is also defined by ( [ def ] ) , but the local map is @xmath89 and @xmath35 may be larger than @xmath90 . \n figure 2 shows an example of the phenomenology described above . \n numerically , it is more convenient to follow the orbits from @xmath79 to increasing values of the coupling . in this picture , as well as in the following ones the map parameter is @xmath0 ( the accumulation point of the period - doubling cascade ) . in figure 2 , from @xmath79 ( the circle ) to @xmath91 ( the point labelled 1 ) , the symmetric orbit is unstable . \n the figure also shows the invariant circle for @xmath92 . between the points 1 and 2 , \n the symmetric orbit is stable . at point 2 , \n the pitchfork occurs , the symmetric orbit becomes unstable and the non - symmetric orbits are created . \n finally , the point 3 ( @xmath93 ) corresponds to the collapse on the synchronized fixed point . \n the previous phenomenology is not restricted to small periods but extend to any power of 2 . \n in particular , the synchronized period-@xmath94 orbit may destabilize to create a symmetric ( non - synchronized ) orbit of twice the period . \n given @xmath95 , let @xmath96 be the components of the period-@xmath94 orbit of @xmath9 . \n the points @xmath97 are the components of the synchronized period-@xmath94 orbit of @xmath39 . by the chain rule and \n since each jacobian at @xmath98 is diagonal , the corresponding multiplier along the anti - diagonal direction is @xmath99 the condition that this multiplier equals @xmath100 determines , if @xmath44 , a co - dimension 1 period - doubling bifurcation . applying the reasoning of the previous section to each component @xmath98 , \n we conclude that this bifurcation creates an orbit with the property @xmath101 and @xmath102 for all @xmath15 , which is called a phase - opposition period-@xmath103 orbit . \n since @xmath104 , this bifurcation occurs only if the bifurcation along the diagonal direction has occurred ( the local period - doubling bifurcation of @xmath96 ) . in other words , the phase opposition period-@xmath94 orbit exists only if the synchronized period-@xmath94 orbit does . \n moreover it follows from figure 3 that , at least for @xmath0 , the phase opposition period-@xmath103 orbit exists only if the phase opposition period-@xmath94 orbit does . \n this is confirmed analytically for the period@xmath105 orbit whose existence condition is the instability of the synchronized period@xmath106 orbit in the anti - diagonal direction . \n one obtains @xmath107 and @xmath108 if @xmath109 and @xmath110 and @xmath111 if @xmath112 ( see figure 1 ) . \n furthermore , a numerical calculation at @xmath0 , reported in figure 3 , shows that the succession of bifurcations of a phase opposition orbit does not depend on the period . on this picture , we have plotted the values of @xmath35 for the hopf bifurcation , the pitchfork bifurcation and the period - doubling bifurcation creating the orbit , versus the power of the period . for each period , the phenomenology is identical to that described in the previous section , with an adequate change of scale in @xmath87 . \n in addition , the picture shows that several phase opposition orbits may be stable for @xmath44 fixed . \n this stabilization is an effect of the coupling that will be discussed below . \n finally , since the phase opposition orbits are the first orbits to appear when the parameters are varied from synchronization and since the first such orbit that is created is of period 2 , it follows that a necessary and sufficient condition for synchronization is @xmath113 , the condition for the existence of the latter . \n we now analyze the existence and the stability of other period-@xmath94 orbits for @xmath0 . \n our interest for this value of @xmath46 is that the scaling properties of @xmath9 are reflected on scaling laws for the periods and values of @xmath35 at which the bifurcations occur ( see figure 3 and 8) . \n we only consider the orbits which for @xmath79 have the same period on projection to both axis @xmath114 and @xmath115 . \n these orbits are followed numerically when @xmath35 increases and are referred using the phase shift of their components at @xmath79 .    for @xmath0 , \n the map @xmath9 has a period-@xmath94 orbit for each @xmath116 , whose components for @xmath117 up to 5 are shown in figure 5 . in this picture , the numbers reflect the order in which the components are visited and the tree structure represents the origin of each component in the bifurcation cascade . an important notion is the dyadic distance @xmath118 between the components of an orbit . \n @xmath118 is the number of steps one has to go back in the bifurcation tree to meet a common component . \n the dyadic distance is used to characterize the families of periodic orbits that we are considering . for instance , the coordinates of each component of a synchronized orbit are at distance 0 , those of a phase - opposition orbit are at distance 1 . \n accordingly , when we speak of distance@xmath119 orbit we refer to the dyadic distance of the coordinates of its components .    for any @xmath120 \n , there are @xmath121 different orbits with distance @xmath118 which have coordinates out of phase by @xmath122 steps , with @xmath123 . \n the distance of a period-@xmath124 orbit is at most @xmath117 ( @xmath125 ) .    for @xmath79 , \n the only symmetric orbits are those at distance 0 and 1 . \n this property is preserved for @xmath44 as shows figure 6 for @xmath126 . \n the succession of bifurcations of orbits with distance @xmath127 should then differ from those with distance 1 . \n the differences are seen in figure 6 which shows the evolution of the eigenvalues . for @xmath79 , \n the orbit is unstable . \n when @xmath35 increases , it suffers two collisions with orbits of twice the period when the eigenvalues cross @xmath100 and then becomes stable . \n ( when decreasing @xmath35 , these collisions would be period - doubling bifurcations . ) if @xmath35 increases further , the orbit collides with an unstable one of the same period in a saddle - node bifurcation when the larger eigenvalue reaches 1 . for larger values of @xmath87 \n , the orbit does not exist . \n the unstable orbit with which it collides is the one that at @xmath79 has period @xmath94 in one projection and @xmath128 in the other . \n for higher dyadic distances , the overall variation of the eigenvalues is similar to the @xmath129 case . \n figure 7 shows a typical example of these phenomena for the case @xmath129 . between @xmath79 and the point \n labelled 1 in the figure , the orbit is unstable . \n the point 1 corresponds to the smaller eigenvalue crossing -1 ( see figure 6 ) . \n therefore , between the point 1 and 2 , the orbit is stable . \n it disappear at the point 2 when it collides with an unstable orbit of the same period . \n we have seen that the coupling stabilizes the orbits with distance larger than 0 at @xmath0 . \n there are indeed two mechanisms responsible for this stabilization .. the determinant of the jacobian of a period-@xmath94 orbit is @xmath130 the term @xmath131 coming from the coupling decreases when @xmath117 increases . \n however , there is yet a second stabilizing mechanism . \n denote by @xmath132 the remaining factor in the determinant @xmath133 without coupling , @xmath134 is simply the square of the multiplier of @xmath9 for the periodic orbit . from the properties of the feigenbaum - cvitanovic functional equation it follows @xcite that this factor converges to a fixed value around @xmath135 when @xmath117 increases . \n the coupling however , changes the position of the orbit components in such a way that this factor also decreases . \n it is the combined action of this decrease with the contraction of the coupling that brings the eigenvalues into the interior of the unit circle and stabilizes the orbits .    for small @xmath35 \n there is a simple geometrical interpretation for the variation of @xmath136 . \n the reason why in the one dimensional map the product @xmath137 remains constant , when @xmath117 grows , is because each time the period doubles , the doubling in the number of factors greater than one is compensated by the fact that the component of the orbit closest to zero approaches zero a little more .    for the unstable orbits along the period - doubling chain , the orbit components closest to zero alternate on each side of the origin . \n the contracting effect of the convex coupling tends to bring the orbits back in the period - doubling hierarchy . \n therefore , because the component closest to zero has to move across the origin for the orbit to approach the one with half the period , this implies that the product of the coordinates is going to decrease . the greater the dyadic distance between the orbit projections on the axis , the greater will be the perturbation that the original ( one - dimensional ) orbits suffer . \n therefore one expects the contracting effect in @xmath136 to increase with the dyadic distance . \n this effect is quite apparent on figure 8 which shows the stabilizing and destabilizing lines for orbits with distance from 1 to 4 . \n the shift downwards of the stable regions for successively larger dyadic distances implies that the smaller @xmath35 is , the larger the number of distinct stable orbits that are obtained . \n an accurate numerical estimate of the number of distinct orbits is obtained by computing the derivative @xmath138 at @xmath79 for each @xmath117 and dyadic distance @xmath139 . \n actually this derivative provides an accurate estimate of @xmath140 itself , because this one varies almost linearly with @xmath35 for most of the stable range of the orbits . on figure 9 , the scaling properties , \n when @xmath117 grows , of this derivative are shown . from these results \n one computes @xmath141 with @xmath142 notice that in figure 9 there is more than one data point for each pair @xmath143 which correspond to non - equivalent orbits with the same dyadic distance .      * the value of the smallest @xmath35 parameter that stabilizes an orbit of dyadic distance @xmath118 equal to the power @xmath117 @xmath144 * the value of the largest @xmath35 parameter for which a @xmath145 orbit is stable @xmath146    from this , one obtains the result that at least @xmath147 distinct stable orbits are obtained if @xmath148 @xmath147 is only a lower bound on the number of distinct stable periodic orbits , because here we have studied only orbits with the same period under projection in the two axis .    in conclusion : _ for sufficiently small _ \n @xmath35 _ _  an arbitrarily large number of distinct stable periodic orbits is obtained__. however , for any fixed @xmath35 , it is an arbitrarily large number that is obtained , not an infinite number . \n most orbits either synchronize ( and are then unstable ) or disappear as @xmath35 grows . as a result , \n a reasoning based on the implicit function theorem , as used in @xcite is misleading . given a sequence of orbits of different periods , even if they remain as orbits for a small perturbation , that does not mean that their ( smallest ) periods remain distinct .",

  "abstract": "This paper explores multistability in dynamical systems, a phenomenon where systems exhibit multiple stable states or attractors under a fixed set of parameters. Multistability has been identified in various fields such as neurosciences, optics, chemistry, condensed matter, and geophysics. The paper focuses on the dynamical mechanisms that lead to multistability, notably through the study of simple models. It discusses Newhouse's mathematical results on the existence of multiple attracting periodic orbits near homoclinic tangencies in dynamical systems and extends these findings to higher dimensions. Additionally, it explores the effects of small dissipative perturbations on conservative systems, which tend to create attractors from invariant sets. The stability of these attractors and their migration in multi-attractor systems are analyzed, mostly through numerical evidence. The paper introduces coupled quadratic maps near the Feigenbaum accumulation point as a model to control multistability, proposing that by understanding and manipulating these maps, it's possible to control chaos in practical scenarios. The model aims to simplify and provide insights into the behavior of multistable systems, potentially offering robust control methods in complex systems."

  "abstract": "This paper investigates macro-bending loss in solid-core photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) with air-silica microstructured cladding, which exhibit novel phenomena such as large-mode area (LMA) endlessly single-mode operation. PCFs typically differ from standard fibers but share some properties like attenuation due to macro-bending. The study revisits macro-bending loss predictions using empirical relations, avoiding the need for complex numerical Maxwell equation solutions and phenomenological parameters like effective core radius. The analysis applies antenna theory modified for high-index contrast PCFs and introduces an empirical formulation with no free parameters. It derives critical bending radius and bending loss predictions based on parameters like the effective area and a newly defined effective V-parameter. Results are validated against experimental data from fabricated LMA fibers, demonstrating that the model accurately predicts bending losses at specific radii without requiring numerical calculations. The findings are particularly relevant for practical applications where macro-bending losses are critical in designing optical systems using photonic crystal fibers."

markovian cases ) , the markov random flight in the three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath1 is , undoubtedly , the most difficult and hard to study . \n while in the low even - dimensional spaces @xmath9 and @xmath10 one managed to obtain the distributions of the motions in an explicit form ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) , in the important three - dimensional case only a few results are known . \n the absolutely continuous part of the transition density of the symmetric markov random flight with unit speed in the euclidean space @xmath1 was presented in ( * ? ? ? \n * formulas ( 1.3 ) and ( 4.21 ) therein ) . \n it has an extremely complicated form of an integral with variable limits whose integrand involves inverse hyperbolic tangent function . \n this formula has so complicated form that can not even be evaluated by means of standard computer environments . \n moreover , the lack of the speed parameter in this formula impoverishes somewhat the model because it does not allow to study the limiting behaviour of the motion under various scaling conditions ( under kac s condition , for example ) . \n the presence of both parameters ( i.e. the speed and the intensity of switchings ) in any process of markov random flight makes it , undoubtedly , the most adequate and realistic model for describing the finite - velocity diffusion in the euclidean spaces . \n these parameters can not be considered as independent because they are connected with each other through the time ( namely , the speed is the distance passed _ per unit of time _ and the intensity is the mean number of switchings _ per unit of time _ ) . \n another question concerning the density presented in @xcite is the infinite discontinuity at the origin @xmath11 . while the infinite discontinuity of the transition density on the border of the diffusion area is a quite natural property in some euclidean spaces of low dimensions ( see @xcite for the euclidean plane @xmath12 and ( * ? ? ? \n * the second term of formulas ( 1.3 ) and ( 4.21 ) ) , @xcite , ( * ? ? ? \n * formula ( 3.12 ) ) in the space @xmath1 ) , the discontinuity at the origin looks somewhat strange and hard to explain . \n the difficulty of analysing the three - dimensional markov random flight and , on the other hand , the great theoretical and applied importance of the problem of describing the finite - velocity diffusion in the space @xmath1 suggest to look for other methods of studying this model . \n that is why various asymptotic theorems yielding a good approximation would be a fairly desirable aim of the research . \n such asymptotic results could be obtained by using the characteristic functions technique . in the case of the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight \n some important results for its characteristic functions were obtained . in particular , the closed - form expression for the laplace transform of the characteristic function was obtained by different methods in ( * ? ? ? \n * formulas ( 1.6 ) and ( 5.8 ) ) ( for unit speed ) and in ( * ? ? ? \n * formula ( 45 ) ) , @xcite ( for arbitrary speed ) . a general relation for the conditional characteristic functions of the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight conditioned by the number of changes of direction , \n was given in ( * ? ? ? \n * formula ( 3.8 ) ) . \n the key point in these formulas is the possibility of evaluating the inverse laplace transforms of the powers of the inverse tangent functions in the complex right half - plane . \n this is the basic idea of deriving the series representations of the conditional characteristic functions corresponding to two and three changes of direction given in section 3 . \n based on these representations , an asymptotic formula , as time @xmath5 , for the unconditional characteristic function is obtained in section 4 and the error in this formula has the order @xmath6 . \n the inverse fourier transformation of the unconditional characteristic function yields an asymptotic formula for the transition density of the process which is presented in section 5 . \n this formula shows that the density is discontinuous on the border , but it is continuous at the origin @xmath11 , as it must be . \n the unexpected and interesting peculiarity is that the conditional density corresponding to two changes of direction contains a term having an infinite discontinuity on the border of the diffusion area . \n from this fact it follows that such conditional density is discontinuous itself on the border and this differs the 3d - model from its 2d - counterpart where only the conditional density of the single change of direction has an infinite discontinuity on the border . \n the error in the obtained asymptotic formula has the order @xmath6 . in section 6 \n we estimate the accuracy of the asymptotic formula and show that it gives a good approximation on small time intervals whose lengths depend on the intensity of switchings . \n finally , in appendices we prove a series of auxiliary lemmas that have been used in our analysis . \n consider the stochastic motion of a particle that , at the initial time instant @xmath13 , starts from the origin @xmath14 of the euclidean space @xmath1 and moves with some constant speed @xmath15 ( note that @xmath15 is treated as the constant norm of the velocity ) . \n the initial direction is a random three - dimensional vector with uniform distribution on the unit sphere @xmath16 the motion is controlled by a homogeneous poisson process @xmath17 of rate @xmath3 as follows . at each poissonian instant , \n the particle instantaneously takes on a new random direction distributed uniformly on @xmath18 independently of its previous motion and keeps moving with the same speed @xmath15 until the next poisson event occurs , then it takes on a new random direction again and so on . \n let @xmath19 be the particle s position at time @xmath20 which is referred to as the three - dimensional symmetric markov random flight . \n at arbitrary time instant @xmath20 the particle , with probability 1 , is located in the closed three - dimensional ball of radius @xmath21 centred at the origin @xmath22 : @xmath23    consider the probability distribution function @xmath24 of the process @xmath4 , where @xmath25 is the infinitesimal element in the space @xmath1 . \n for arbitrary fixed @xmath20 , the distribution @xmath26 consists of two components . \n the singular component corresponds to the case when no poisson events occur on the time interval @xmath27 and it is concentrated on the sphere @xmath28 in this case , at time instant @xmath29 , the particle is located on the sphere @xmath30 and the probability of this event is @xmath31    if at least one poisson event occurs on the time interval @xmath32 , then the particle is located strictly inside the ball @xmath33 and the probability of this event is @xmath34 the part of the distribution @xmath26 corresponding to this case is concentrated in the interior @xmath35 of the ball @xmath33 and forms its absolutely continuous component . \n let @xmath36 be the density of distribution @xmath37 . \n it has the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the density ( in the sense of generalized functions ) of the singular component of @xmath26 concentrated on the sphere @xmath30 and @xmath40 is the density of the absolutely continuous component of @xmath26 concentrated in @xmath41 . \n the singular part of density ( [ struc2 ] ) is given by the formula : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the dirac delta -

step function given by @xmath47    asymptotic behaviour of the transition density ( [ struc2 ] ) on small time intervals is the main subject of this research . since its singular part \n is explicitly given by ( [ denss ] ) , then our efforts are mostly concentrated on deriving the respective asymptotic formulas for the absolutely continuous component ( [ densac ] ) of the density . \n our main tool is the characteristic functions technique because , as it was mentioned above , some closed -

Unlike simpler two-dimensional models, the three-dimensional case presents unique challenges, such as the absence of a speed parameter which limits analysis under various scaling conditions. This paper explores the use of asymptotic theorems and characteristic functions to approximate the behavior of such random flights. Significant results include the derivation of asymptotic formulas for the characteristic functions related to the number of direction changes, and an effective method for estimating the transition density using inverse Fourier and Laplace transforms. The insights gained point towards an advanced understanding of finite-velocity diffusion processes in higher dimensions and suggest methods to handle the complex calculations required for such stochastic models."

based method @xcite , or the scaling analysis of probability density function of velocity increments @xcite , to name a few . \n each method has its owner advantages and shortcomings . \n for example , the classical sfs is found to mix information of the large- ( resp . known as infrared effect ) and small - scale ( resp . known as ultraviolet effect ) \n structures @xcite . \n the corresponding scaling exponent @xmath0 is thus biased when a large energetic structure is present @xcite . \n previously the influence of the large -

scale structure could be as large as two decades down to the small scales . \n blum et al . \n , @xcite studied experimentally the nonuniversal large - scale structure by considering both conditional eulerian and lagrangian sfs . \n they found that both sfs depend on the strength of large - scale structures at all scales . in their study , the large - scale structure velocity is defined as two - point average , i.e. , @xmath13/2 $ ] , in which @xmath14 is the vertical velocity in their experiment apparatus . \n note that they conditioned sfs on different intensity of @xmath15 . \n later , blum et al . \n , @xcite investigated systematically the large - scale structure conditioned sfs for various turbulent flows . \n they confirmed that in different turbulent flows the conditioned sfs depends strongly on large - scale structures at all scales .    in this paper , \n a detrended structure - function ( dsf ) method is proposed to extract scaling exponents @xmath0 . \n this is accomplished by removing a @xmath1st - order polynomial within a window size @xmath2 before calculating the velocity increment . \n this procedure is designated as detrending analysis ( da ) . by doing so , scales larger than @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath3 , are expected to be removed or constrained . \n hence , the da acts as a high - pass filter in physical domain . \n meanwhile , the intermittency is still retained . \n a velocity increment @xmath16 is then defined within the window size @xmath2 . \n a @xmath12th - order moment of @xmath16 is introduced as @xmath12th - order dsf . \n the dsf is first validated by using a synthesized fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) and a lognormal process with an intermittent parameter @xmath17 respectively for mono - fractal and multifractal processes . \n it is found that dsfs provide comparable scaling exponents @xmath0 and singularity spectra @xmath4 with the ones provided by the original sfs . \n when applying to a turbulent velocity with a reynolds number @xmath18 , the @xmath19rd - order dsf shows a clear inertial range @xmath7 , which is consistent with the one predicted by the fourier power spectrum @xmath20 , e.g. , @xmath8 . \n moreover , a compensated height of the @xmath19rd - order dsf is @xmath21 . \n this value is consistent with the famous kolmogorov four - fifth law . \n the directly measured scaling exponents @xmath0 ( resp . \n singularity spectrum @xmath4 ) agree very well with the lognormal model with an intermittent parameter @xmath9 . due to the large - scale effect , known as infrared effect , the sfs are biased . \n note that the scaling exponents are extracted directly without resorting to the extended - self - similarity ( ess ) technique . \n the method is general and could be applied to different types of data , in which the multiscale and multifractal concepts are relevant . \n we start here with a scaling process @xmath22 , which has a power - law fourier spectrum , i.e. , @xmath23 in which @xmath24 is the scaling exponent of @xmath25 . \n the parseval s theorem states the following relation , i.e. , @xmath26 in which @xmath27 is ensemble average , @xmath25 is the fourier power spectrum of @xmath22 @xcite . \n we first divide the given @xmath22 into @xmath28 segments with a length @xmath2 each . \n a @xmath29th - order detrending of the @xmath30th segment is defined as , i.e. , @xmath31 in which @xmath32 is a @xmath29th - order polynomial fitting of the @xmath33 . \n we consider below only for the first - order detrending , i.e. , @xmath34 . to obtain a detrended signal , i.e. , @xmath35 $ ] \n , a linear trend is removed within a window size @xmath2 . ideally , scales larger than @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath36 are removed or constrained from the original data @xmath22 . \n this implies that the da procedure is a high - pass filter in the physical domain . \n the kinetic energy of @xmath37 is related directly with its fourier power spectrum , i.e. , @xmath38 in which @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the fourier power spectrum of @xmath37 . \n this illustrates again that the da procedure acts a high - pass filter , in which the lower fourier modes @xmath41 ( resp . \n @xmath36 ) are expected to be removed or constrained . for a scaling process , i.e. , @xmath42 , it leads a power - law behavior , i.e. , @xmath43 the physical meaning of @xmath44 is quite clear . \n it represents a cumulative energy over the fourier wavenumber band @xmath45 $ ] ( resp . scale range @xmath46 $ ] ) . \n we emphasize here again that the da acts as a high - pass filter in physical domain and the intermittency nature of @xmath22 is still retained . \n the above mentioned detrending analysis can remove / constrain the large - scale influence , known as infrared effect . \n this could be utilized to redefine the sf to remove / constrain the large - scale structure effect as following . \n after the da procedure , , the velocity increment can be defined within a window size @xmath2 as , i.e. , @xmath47 in which @xmath30 represents for the @xmath30th segment . \n we will show in the next subsection why we define an increment with a half width of the window size . \n a @xmath12th - order dsf is then defined as , i.e. , @xmath48 for a scaling process , we expect a power - law behavior , i.e. , @xmath49 in which the scaling exponent @xmath0 is comparable with the one provided by the original sfs .    to access negative orders of @xmath12 ( resp . \n the right part of the singularity spectrum @xmath4 , see definition below ) , the dsfs can be redefined as , i.e. , @xmath50 in which @xmath51 is local average for the @xmath30th segment . \n a power - law behavior is expected , i.e. , @xmath52 . \n it is found experimentally that when @xmath53 , eqs . \n ( [ eq : dsf ] ) and  ( [ eq : rdsf ] ) provide the same scaling exponents @xmath0 . in the following \n we do not discriminate these two definitions for dsfs .       for different methods : structure - function @xmath54 ( dashed line ) , first - order detrending analysis @xmath55 ( thin solid line ) , and the detrended structure - function @xmath56 ( thick solid line ) . \n the detrended scale @xmath2 is demonstrated by a vertical solid line with @xmath39 . \n ideally , scales larger than @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath57 ( resp . \n @xmath41 ) are expected to be removed after the detrending process . ]    to understand better the filter property of the detrending procedure and dsfs , we introduce here a weight function @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath59 in which @xmath25 is the fourier power spectrum of @xmath22 , and @xmath60 is a second - order moment , which could be one of @xmath44 or @xmath61 , or @xmath62 , respectively . \n the weight function @xmath58 characterizes the contribution of the fourier component to the corresponding second - order moment . \n note that an integral constant is neglected in the eq . \n ( [ eq : weight ] ) . for the second - order sfs \n , one has the following weight function @xcite , i.e. , @xmath63 for a scaling process , one usually has a fast decaying fourier spectrum , i.e. @xmath42 with @xmath64 . \n hence , the contribution from small - scale ( resp . \n high wavenumber fourier mode ) is decreasing . \n the sfs might be more influenced by the large - scale part for large values of @xmath24 @xcite . \n for the detrended data , the corresponding weight function is ideally to be as the following , i.e. , @xmath65 the dsfs ( resp . \n the combination of the da and sf ) have a weight function , i.e. , @xmath66 comparing with the original sfs , the dsfs defined here can remove / constrain the large -

hopkins university with reynolds number @xmath18 . \n an probe array with four x - type hot wire anemometry is used to record the velocity with a sampling wavenumber of @xmath119khz at streamwise direction @xmath120 , in which @xmath121 is the size of the active grid . \n these probes are placed in the middle height and along the center line of the wind tunnel to record the turbulent velocity simultaneously for a duration of 30 second . \n the measurement is then repeated for 30 times . finally , we have @xmath122 data points ( number of measurements @xmath123 number of probes @xmath123 duration time @xmath123 sampling wavenumber ) \n . therefore , there are 120 realizations ( number of measurements @xmath123 number of probes ) . \n the fourier power spectrum @xmath20 of the longitudinal velocity reveals a nearly two decades inertial range on the wavenumber range @xmath8 with a scaling exponent @xmath124 , see ref . \n this corresponds to time scales @xmath7 . here \n @xmath125 is the kolmogorov scale . \n note that we convert our results into spatial space by applying the taylors frozen hypothesis @xcite . \n more detail about this database can be found in ref.@xcite .    to determine the inertial range in real space \n , we plot the measured compensated 3rd - order moments in fig.[fig : third ] for the sfs ( @xmath126 with ( @xmath80 ) and without ( @xmath81 ) absolute value ) , dsfs ( @xmath105 with ( @xmath106 ) and without ( @xmath107 ) absolute value ) , respectively . \n a horizontal solid line indicates the kolmogorovs four - fifth law . \n a plateau is observed for @xmath105 on the range @xmath7 , which agrees very well with the inertial range predicted by @xmath20 , i.e. , on the range @xmath8 . the corresponding height and scaling exponent \n are @xmath21 with absolute value ( resp . \n @xmath113 without absolute value ) and @xmath127 ( resp . \n @xmath128 ) , respectively . \n the statistical error is the standard deviation obtained from the range @xmath7 . \n note that the kolmogorovs four - fifth law indicates a linear relation @xmath129 . \n it is interesting to note that , despite of the sign , we have @xmath130 on nearly two - decade scales . for comparison \n , the 3rd - order sfs are also shown . \n roughly speaking , a plateau is observed on the range @xmath110 . this inertial range is shorter than the one predicted by the fourier analysis or dsfs , which is now understood as the large - scale influence . the corresponding height and scaling exponent are @xmath111 without absolute value ( resp . \n @xmath112 with absolute value ) and @xmath115 ( resp . \n @xmath131 ) . therefore , the dsfs provide a better indicator of the inertial range since it removes / constrains the large - scale influence . \n we therefore estimate the scaling exponents for the @xmath132 on the range @xmath7 for @xmath69 directly without resorting to the extended self - similarity technique @xcite . for the sfs \n , we calculate the scaling exponents @xmath0 on the range @xmath110 for @xmath82 directly . \n figure [ fig : singularity ] shows the measured singularity spectra @xmath4 for @xmath78 , in which the errorbar is a standard deviation from 120 realizations . \n the inset shows the corresponding scaling exponents @xmath0 . for comparison , \n the lognormal model @xmath133 with an intermittent parameter @xmath9 is shown as a solid line . \n visually , the dsfs curve fully recovers the lognormal curve not only on the left part ( resp . \n @xmath134 ) but also on the right part ( resp . \n @xmath135 ) . due to the large - scale contamination \n , the sfs underestimates the scaling exponents @xmath0 when @xmath134 @xcite . \n this leads an overestimation of the left part of singularity spectrum @xmath4 ( see @xmath80 in fig.[fig : singularity ] ) . however , \n if one resorts the ess algorithm when measuring the sf scaling exponent @xmath0 , the corresponding singularity spectrum @xmath4 is then horizontal shifted to the theoretical curve . \n this has been interpreted as that the ess technique suppresses the finite reynolds number effect . \n we show here that if one removes / constrains the effect of large - scale motions , one can retrieve the scaling exponent @xmath0 ( resp . \n singularity spectrum @xmath4 ) without resorting the ess technique . or in other words , the finite reynolds number effect manifests at large - scale motions , which is usually anisotropic too . \n in this paper , we introduce a detrended structure - function analysis to remove / constrain the influence of large - scale motions , known as the infrared effect . in the first step of our proposal , \n the @xmath1st - order polynomial trend is removed within a window size @xmath2 . by doing so , \n the scales larger than @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath136 , are expected to be removed / constrained . in the second step , a velocity increment is defined with a half of the window size . \n the dsf proposal is validated by the synthesized fractional brownian motion for the mono - fractal process and a lognormal random walk for the multifractal process . \n the numerical test shows that both sfs and dsfs estimators provide a comparable performance for synthesized processes without intrinsic structures . \n when applying to the turbulent velocity obtained from a high reynolds number wind tunnel experiment , the 3rd - order dsfs show a clearly inertial range on the range @xmath7 with a linear relation @xmath137 . \n the inertial range provided by dsfs is consistent with the one predicted by the fourier power spectrum . \n note that , despite of the sign , the kolmogorovs four - fifth law is retrieved for the 3rd - order dsfs . \n the corresponding 3rd - order sfs are biased by the large - scale structures , known as the infrared effect . \n it shows a shorter inertial range and underestimate the 3rd - order scaling exponent @xmath114 . \n the scaling exponents @xmath0 are then estimated directly without resorting to the ess technique . \n the corresponding singularity spectrum @xmath4 provided by the dsfs fully recovers the lognormal model with an intermittent parameter @xmath9 on the range @xmath69 . \n however , the classical sfs overestimate the left part singularity spectrum @xmath4 ( resp . \n underestimate the corresponding scaling exponents @xmath0 ) on the range @xmath138 . \n this has been interpreted as finite reynolds number effect and can be corrected by using the ess technique . here , to our knowledge , we show for the first time that if one removes / constrains the influence of the large - scale structures , one can recover the lognormal model without resorting to the ess technique . \n the method we proposed here is general and applicable to other complex dynamical systems , in which the multiscale statistics are relevant . \n it should be also applied systematically to more turbulent velocity databases with different reynolds numbers to see whether the finite reynolds number effect manifests on large - scale motions as well as we show for high reynolds number turbulent flows . \n this work is sponsored by the national natural science foundation of china under grant ( nos . \n 11072139 , 11032007,11161160554 , 11272196 , 11202122 and 11332006 ) , pu jiang project of shanghai ( no . \n 12pj1403500 ) , innovative program of shanghai municipal education commission ( no . \n 11zz87 ) and the shanghai program for innovative research team in universities . \n y.h . thanks prof . \n schmitt for useful comments and suggestions . \n we thank prof . \n meneveau for sharing his experimental velocity database , which is available for download at c. meneveau s web page : http://www.me.jhu.edu/meneveau/datasets.html . \n we thank the two anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions . \n f. schmitt , y. huang , z. lu , y. liu , and n. fernandez , _ analysis of velocity fluctuations and their intermittency properties in the surf zone using empirical mode decomposition _ , j. mar . \n 77 ( 2009 ) , pp . \n 473481 . \n j. muzy , e. bacry , and a. arneodo , _ multifractal formalism for fractal signals : the structure -

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a detrended structure-function (DSF) method for extracting scaling exponents in multiscale dynamics systems, such as turbulence. Unlike traditional methods that may be biased due to the infrared effect from large-scale structures, the proposed DSF approach uses a detrending analysis to act as a high-pass filter, removing influences from scales larger than a specified window size while retaining intermittency. The method is validated using synthesized fractional Brownian motion and lognormal processes, and applied to turbulent velocity data with high Reynolds numbers, confirming the effectiveness of DSFs in providing consistent scaling exponents and singularity spectra without the need for extended self-similarity techniques. This approach can potentially be applied across different data types where multiscale and multifractal processes are relevant."

        "article": "a fair number of astronomers and astronomy students have a physical challenge . \n it is our responsibility to learn the basics of accessibility to be able to help our library patrons to gain access to things that they need for their studies and work . \n astronomy is often seen as a very visual science . \n after all , its origins lie in looking at the skies . \n hence , it is a common belief that you need to use your sight to be able to study astronomy . \n this is strictly not true . in reality \n , we have been using assistive technologies  telescopes , sensors , computers  for a long time now to gain access to data that the human eye does not see unaided . \n visual information is coming to us as large streams of bytes . \n the modern astronomer is hardly bound by physical limitations . \n one can produce solid research sitting comfortably in front of one s personal computer . \n there are many examples of physically challenged individuals who have made successful careers in science . \n those who have seen the movie _ contact _ based on carl sagan s novel are familiar with the blind astronomer who is listening to radio signals instead of watching them on the screen . \n his character is based on a real scientist , dr . d. kent cullers . \n there are other success stories  in fact , too many to enumerate here . \n but , you ask , is nt the sheer amount of information a major hindrance to those who can not browse it easily ? yes , it is  to some degree . \n electronic textual materials provide both a possibility and a challenge for those with low vision . in theory , it is possible for almost anyone to access online information , but in practice , this requires know - how and proper tools . \n plenty of assistive technologies exist to overcome hindrances . \n the daisy standard for digital talking books has been an important tool for making electronic texts easy to browse . \n not all hindrances are in the visual domain . \n imagine an elderly astronomer who has the full use of his or her intelligence , but whose hands are shaking , and who might have some difficulty with pointing a mouse when navigating a webpage and filling out search forms .    it is a challenging task for librarians and information specialists to make our services and search forms accessible to people with a diversity of abilities so that they can do the research necessary for building careers as active contributors in their chosen fields of research . \n but what does accessibility look like ? \n there is a pervasive myth that it looks boring . \n this is strictly not true . \n accessible design should be functional enough , not just pretty . with proper html code and other techniques , we can make the text compliant with technological aids . \n if the html coding is poor , a document may be impossible to open with such aids or it could be impossible to navigate the text . \n the author of this paper was involved with an university - wide accessibility project that was undertaken by the university of helsinki in 20052006 , with a follow up in 20082009 . \n it was recognized that accessibility must cover not only our physical surroundings , but also the online environment as well .    in spring 2009 \n , we noticed that the new national online system for applying for university education was not accessible to blind students . \n the system was provided by the finnish ministry of education , and we challenged them to fix it . to our big surprise , they did , working in collaboration with us and the finnish federation of the visually impaired . \n figure 1 shows a page from the application system . \n it looks exactly the same both before and after accessibility changes were made . \n differences can be seen on the coding level , but otherwise one can not tell the old version from the new one by visual inspection alone . the change has resulted in a major functional improvement . the old version could not even be opened with assistive technology , and blind students could not use it . now they can . \n accessibility needs some muscle to drive it . \n it is not just about good people doing good deeds  it is also about ensuring that everyone has access to things that matter to them . \n we need guidelines and standards , preferably with legislation to back them up .    in the united states , section 508 of the rehabilitation act \n regulates purchases made with federal funding . \n it is about `` access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to others . '' \n a market for accessible products helps big publishers to take accessibility into account . when a publisher has a large enough number of customers who need to buy accessible products , they will be motivated to sell accessible products . \n we also need strong standards . the world wide consortium has updated its web content accessibility guidelines ( wcag )  version 2 dates back to 2008 . \n this new version of wcag is meant to be a practical tool , evidenced by its three levels of accessibility :    * a : minimum * aa : medium * aaa : as accessible as possible    you will find a good wcag2 checklist online . \n the ideal thing to do would be to make your website as accessible as possible , but in practice you need to read the guidelines and identify the accessibility level best suited to serving your users . \n let s look at a concrete example by applying an a - level guideline to an existing search form . \n the guideline states : `` form inputs have associated text labels or , if labels can not be used , a descriptive title attribute .

        "abstract": "This article explores the integration of accessibility in astronomy for individuals with physical challenges. It emphasizes the evolution of astronomy from a visually-dependent science to one that utilizes assistive technologies, enabling access to astronomical data in non-visual formats. Highlighting examples like Dr. D. Kent Cullers, a blind astronomer, it challenges the misconception that sight is necessary for studying astronomy. The article discusses the role of information specialists in facilitating accessibility and stresses the importance of inclusive design in educational and professional settings. It advocates for strong standards and legislation to ensure that accessibility in astronomy is comprehensive and effective."

        "article": "polluted white dwarfs ( typed with a suffix `` z '' ) provide an opportunity to investigate the ultimate fate of planetary systems . \n although planets have not yet been detected around white dwarfs , the evidence for the presence of planetary debris around these objects lies in their polluted atmospheres . \n approximately one quarter of white dwarfs show the presence of elements heavier than helium in their atmospheres @xcite and approximately one fifth of these have a mid - infrared ( ir ) excess that is consistent with a circumstellar , debris disc @xcite . more recently using the cosmic origins spectrograph on the _ hubble space telescope _ @xcite have shown that about half of da white dwarfs with effective temperatures ranging from 17000 k to 27000 k have polluted atmospheres . \n several detailed studies of polluted white dwarfs have uncovered large variations in the composition of the accreted material . based on a study of ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of a sample of white dwarfs ( 19000 < @xmath0 k ) \n , @xcite showed that the abundance diversity in the accreted material is similar to that observed among solar system meteorites , although the effect of selective radiative radiation pressure on accretion rate calculations was neglected . \n @xcite demonstrated that selective radiation pressure on trace elements , silicon for instance , shapes observed abundance patterns in hot white dwarfs ( @xmath1 k ) . after including this effect in their calculations , \n @xcite concluded that at least 27% of their white dwarf sample , which includes the @xcite sample , would be currently accreting , while in 29% of these objects , usually among the warmest in their sample , the effect of radiative levitation dominates the abundance pattern . \n the inclusion of this effect also leads to a reduction in the estimated accretion flow in some objects with @xmath2 k ( e.g. , wd0431 + 126 ) . \n an analysis of uv and optical spectra of two additional white dwarfs by @xcite show the accreting source to be of a rocky nature where the abundance of refractory elements is enhanced compared to volatile elements . \n also , @xcite showed that the cool , hydrogen - rich and magnetic white dwarf nltt  43806 ( typed dazh ) is enriched in aluminium but poor in iron which suggests that the accreting material is similar to the earth lithosphere . \n oxygen has been detected in several white dwarfs ( e.g. , galex  j1931 + 0117 ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , and , in some of these objects , the amount of oxygen with respect to the other heavier elements detected suggests that the accreted material contains significant amount of water . \n for example , in gd  61 @xcite found that the accreted material contains oxygen in excess of the amount expected to be carried by metal oxides , suggesting that the parent material contained water . a similar \n finding , but with a higher fraction of water , was found in the case of sdss  j124231.07@xmath3522626.6 @xcite . \n the material accreted at the surface of a white dwarf is subjected to diffusion processes : trace elements are quickly mixed in the convective envelope of cool white dwarfs , and diffuse - out below the convection zone in a period of time much shorter than evolutionary timescales @xcite . \n recent estimates @xcite of diffusion timescales show that relics of an accretion event remain visible in the photosphere of a cool ( 6000  k ) hydrogen - rich white dwarf for nearly @xmath4 years and much longer ( several @xmath5 years ) for cool helium - rich white dwarfs . however , the observed abundance would follow details of the accretion history , and the presence of heavy elements is likely transitory when compared to the cooling age of old white dwarfs ( @xmath6 years ) . \n we present a spectroscopic and photometric analysis of an hitherto unknown cool , polluted white dwarf ( nltt  19868 ) from the revised nltt catalogue of @xcite . \n we provide details of the new observations in section 2 : we obtained new low- and high - dispersion spectra as well as new and archival photometric measurements allowing to build a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . in section 3 , \n we analyse our new data and derive atmospheric parameters : temperature , surface gravity , and composition . \n next , in section 4 , we attempt to reconstruct recent accretion history onto this object . \n then , we draw a comparison with the sample of cool white dwarfs highlighting the peculiar photospheric composition of the cool white dwarf nltt  19868 , and , finally , we summarize our results . \n we present detailed spectroscopic and photometric observations of the newly identified white dwarf nltt  19868 . \n we first observed nltt  19868 with the eso faint object spectrograph and camera ( efosc2 ) attached to the new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla observatory on ut 2009 march 3 . using grism number 11 ( 300 lines / mm ) with the slit - width set to 1 arcsec \n , we obtained a resolution of @xmath7  . \n the two consecutive spectra of 1800 s each revealed a cool daz white dwarf with strong h&k lines . \n we followed up on our initial observations with four sets of echelle spectra of using the x - shooter spectrograph @xcite attached to the ut3 at paranal observatory on ut 2014 may 1 , 29 and june 1 . \n the slit - width was set to 0.5 , 0.9 and 0.6 arcsec for the uvb , vis and nir arms , respectively . \n this setup provided a resolving power of 9900 , 7450 and 7780 for the uvb , vis and nir arms , respectively . \n the exposure times for the uvb and vis arms were 2940 and 3000 s , respectively , and for the nir arm we obtained five exposures of 600 s each . \n we used the acquisition images from the efosc2 and x - shooter observations to obtain estimates of @xmath8 and @xmath9 magnitudes of nltt  19868 , respectively . \n first , we measured the instrumental magnitudes of nltt  19868 and of a brighter comparison star ( ra[j2000]=08h 36 m 03.44s , dec[j2000]=@xmath101005525 ) with published photometry ( @xmath11 mag ,  @xmath12 mag ,   @xmath13 mag , and @xmath14 mag ) from the aavso photometric all - sky survey ( apass ) . \n apass is an all - sky survey conducted in five filters ( johnson @xmath15 and @xmath9 , and sloan @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) with a magnitude range from approximately 10 up to 17 . \n we converted the sloan @xmath17 magnitude to the johnson @xmath8 magnitude using the transformation equations of lupton ( 2005):[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xmath19 or @xmath20 we calculated @xmath8 using both equations and used the average of the two measurements ( @xmath21 mag ) . finally , using the difference between the instrumental magnitudes of nltt  19868 and the comparison star , we calculated @xmath22 mag and @xmath23 mag for nltt  19868 . \n note that the uncertainties for @xmath9 and @xmath8 are statistical only and neglect any possible systematic effects . \n we obtained ir photometric measurements from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ? * ) and _ _ w__ide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ; * ? ? ? \n the measurements which are all on the vega system are listed in table  [ tbl_phot ] . \n the @xmath24 and @xmath25 measurements are not listed because only upper limits were available for this object . \n we have examined the _ wise _ images in combination with our x - shooter @xmath9 acquisition images . \n these images show that there is a nearby star 5.2 arcsec away at a position angle p.a . \n = 98@xmath26 . \n the crowded star does not share the white dwarf proper motion and , consequently , is not physically related . using the proper motion of nltt  19868 \n the distance between the nearby star and nltt  19868 would have been 5.2 arcsec at p.a . \n = 107@xmath26 at the time the _ wise _ images were obtained ( 2010 ) . since the point spread function ( psf ) of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are 6.1 and 6.4 arcsec , respectively \n , the _ wise _ photometric measurements listed in table  [ tbl_phot ] should combine both nltt  19868 and the nearby object . \n the amount of contamination is unknown since the spectral type of the nearby star is unknown , although its sed shows it to be a cool object ( @xmath29k ) . \n we have examined the 2mass images which show that nltt  19868 and the nearby object are clearly separated , and we conclude that the 2mass photometric measurements of nltt  19868 are not contaminated by the nearby star . \n the 2mass catalog did not contain any flags that would suggest problems with the @xmath30 photometry . \n .photometry and astrometry [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] \n abundance studies of cool , hence old white dwarfs allow to determine the frequency of planetary debris at an advanced cooling age , i.e. , long after the parent star left the main - sequence . \n also , because of the longer diffusion timescales predicted in cool white dwarfs , diffusion effects may become more apparent , particularly following a discrete accretion event . in this case , a spread of diffusion timescales within a group of elements would lead to time - dependent alteration to abundance ratios allowing for a critical examination of the physical conditions at the base of the convection zone ( see * ? ? ? * ) . \n the number of cool daz white dwarfs remains low compared to the number of their hot daz counterparts , or to the helium - rich dz white dwarfs . \n concentrating our efforts on the hydrogen - rich sample may help establish whether their environment is similar to the more common dzs . in this context , \n our analysis of the cool daz white dwarf nltt  19868 and similar objects is timely . \n nltt  19868 lies among the coolest known daz white dwarfs . only three other daz white dwarfs \n have temperatures below 5500 k : g174 - 14 ( @xmath31 k , @xcite ) , nltt  10480 ( @xmath32 k , @xcite ) and g77 - 50 ( @xmath33 k , @xcite ) . \n the effective temperature adopted for g77 - 50 is the weighted average of the two measurements from @xcite and @xcite .    fig . \n [ fig_ratio ] ( top panel ) plots the calcium abundance of all known cool daz white dwarfs with temperatures lower than 7000  k. the effective temperature for seven of these objects were updated with the results of @xcite . \n the calcium abundance varies by several orders of magnitudes , consistent with other studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n this range of abundances is possibly a result of large variations in the accreted mass and of a possible time lapse since the last accretion event resulting in a diffusion - induced decline in the observed abundance . \n [ fig_ratio ] ( bottom panel ) also shows the fe / ca abundance ratio for stars with a measurable iron abundance . even though the sample is small , a large dispersion ( @xmath34 ) in the fe / ca abundance ratio is observed .    within the small sample of objects depicted in fig . \n [ fig_ratio ] , @xmath35 averages @xmath36 , which is lower than the bulk - earth abundance ratio of @xmath37 @xcite but is still consistent given the @xmath38 of the sample . \n we compared our cool sample to the larger sample of 50 polluted white dwarfs presented by @xcite which includes white dwarfs with @xmath39 k to @xmath40 k. our cool sample has a slightly smaller average but a larger dispersion than what is observed in the @xcite sample which has an average of @xmath41 and a @xmath42 . \n the likely reason for the difference in the dispersion is that in the hotter sample the dispersion is smaller than in the cooler sample and hence bringing down the dispersion in the @xcite sample . \n hence , the extrema at @xmath43 ( nltt  888 ; * ? ? ? \n * ) and @xmath44 ( nltt  19868 ) are notable . \n the abundance ratio observed in the nltt  888 is only second to that of the cool dz white dwarf sdss  j1043 + 3516 ( @xmath45 , * ? ? ? \n * ) while fe / ca in nltt  19868 is slightly lower than in the cool daz nltt  43806 ( @xmath46 , * ? ? ? \n the observed abundance ratio @xmath47 in nltt  19868 is also the lowest known among known polluted white dwarfs , underlining the low relative abundance of fe with respect to the other detected elements . \n this abundance ratio is slightly lower than that of nltt  43806 ( @xmath48=-0.2 , * ? ? ? \n . finally , the abundance ratio @xmath49 is among the lowest in polluted white dwarf atmospheres , in fact it is the second lowest after the heavily polluted dbaz gd  362 ( @xmath50 , * ? ? ? \n * ) . a comparison with the population of the 60 polluted white dwarfs showing mg @xcite , for which the average is @xmath51 with a dispersion of 0.4 , clearly places nltt  19868 at the magnesium - deficient end of the distribution .        diffusion at the bottom of the convection zone alters the observed abundance pattern over a time period much shorter than cooling timescales \n . elements with short diffusion timescales relative to other elements are depleted faster and observed abundance ratios must vary over time . in a regime of steady state accretion , \n the hypothetical z1/z2 abundance ratio is simply given by @xmath52 while in the declining phase , i.e. , after mass accretion ceased , the time ( @xmath53 ) dependent abundance ratio is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the diffusion timescales at the bottom of the convection zone which is assumed to be homogeneously mixed . \n unfortunately , diffusion timescales are uncertain . \n few calculations are available for objects with effective temperatures below 6000  k. the abundance pattern in the accreted material @xmath56 is also uncertain and may , for example , correspond to solar ( see * ? ? ? \n * ) , bulk , core , or mantle earth @xcite . \n other types of material , based on an analogy with solar system bodies such as those of meteorites or asteroids can also be considered .    a study of the fe / ca abundance ratio in the extreme cases of nltt  888 ( @xmath57  k ) and nltt  19868 ( @xmath58 \n k ) and of applicable scenarios supports intrinsic abundance variations in the accreted material with likely alterations brought upon by diffusion effects . \n the observed fe / ca ratio is 58 in nltt  888 and 0.59 in nltt  19868 . in both cases , steady - state accretion regime does not significantly alter the observed ratio relative to the parent material ratio . \n first , we examine the case of nltt  888 . \n interpolating the tables of @xcite between 5000 and 6000  k , we find @xmath59 and the abundance ratio in both media are nearly identical . \n using timescales from @xcite , @xmath60 , leads to the same conclusion . \n therefore , the estimated ratio in the accreted material fe / ca @xmath61 largely exceeds that of bulk- ( @xmath6213.4 ) or mantle - earth ( @xmath621.8 ) suggesting that the accreted material in nltt  888 consists of 66% core material and 34% mantle using mass fractions converted to numbers fractions for these various media from @xcite and @xcite . considering that the fe / ca abundance ratio is likely to decrease over a diffusion time scale ( @xmath63 years ) in the eventuality that accretion is turned off , the inferred fraction of core material found in the parent body of the accreted material of nltt  888 must be considered a lower limit . \n the predominance of core iron material implies the likely presence of the , yet undetected , core elements such as nickel and sulfur @xcite . a significant amount of silicon ( 6% by mass , * ? \n * ) is also predicted to be present in the core , although if both core and mantle are to be accreted , most of the silicon would come from the mantle . among the larger population of polluted white dwarfs , \n including higher temperature stars , such as in the sample of @xcite iron - enrichment is also observed , for example , when compared to silicon , both pg  0843@xmath3516 and pg  1015@xmath3161 accrete material where the fe / si ratio is comparable to the core earth . however , a comparison of the fe / ca ratio for stars in their sample , galex  1931@xmath30117 is the one with the highest fe / ca ratio @xcite and is only slightly lower than that of nltt  888 . \n scenarios for nltt  19868 suggest that , on the contrary , core - type material is largely absent and that the accreted material is most likely composed of mantle - type material . \n assuming steady - state accretion , the low iron content in the atmosphere implies a similar deficiency in the parent material , i.e. , significantly lower than the earth s mantle composition . \n such a deficiency of iron in the parent material , i.e. , below that of the earth s mantle , may not be necessary . \n the observed fe / ca abundance ratio is well reproduced if the accretion of earth s mantle like material turned off @xmath64 years ago , allowing to further reduce the fe / ca abundance ratio in the convection zone to the observed level . \n note that diffusion timescales tabulated by @xcite are systematically longer than those tabulated by @xcite by up to a factor of three . \n the difference arises because the convection zone reaches deeper in envelope models used by @xcite where diffusion would operate in a denser medium . \n the depth of the convection zone at low temperatures ( @xmath65  k ) is not affected by the various treatments of the mixing length theory but , instead by different treatments of the equation - of - state and of the conductive opacity @xcite . \n interpolating the tables of @xcite and @xcite between 5000 and 6000  k , we find @xmath66 and 0.96 , respectively . \n assuming mantle composition in the source , the original fe / ca ratio of 1.8 would be reduced to the observed ratio of 0.59 in @xmath67 years following @xcite or a much longer time of @xmath68 years following @xcite . a longer elapsed time implied by the calculations of @xcite \n requires an unrealistically large accretion event ( @xmath69 ) . using the shorter elapsed time implied by the calculations of @xcite results we can calculate an initial iron abundance of fe / h @xmath70 using : @xmath71 where the elapsed time since the accretion event is @xmath72 years and \n the diffusion timescale is @xmath73 years . \n assuming that the mass of the convection zone is @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite , then @xmath76  g , and the total mass of iron accreted onto the white dwarf is @xmath77  g , or , assuming an iron mass fraction of 6% in the mantle , the original accretion event would have weighed @xmath78  g. this mass corresponds to less than one thousandth of the mass of the earth ( @xmath79 ) . the same diffusion scenario , but employing earth bulk material characterized by a higher fe / ca abundance ratio than in the mantle , would require a larger settling time scale ( elapsed time @xmath80 years ) to match the low , present - day fe / ca abundance ratio . \n assuming an accretion event as large as the convection zone itself , even calcium would have disappeared below the detection limit ( @xmath81 ) after @xmath80 years .    in summary , we have identified a new cool , polluted white dwarf showing strong lines of calcium among weaker lines of magnesium , aluminium , and iron . \n our model atmosphere analysis revealed the lowest iron to calcium abundance ratio of any cool polluted white dwarf . applying heavy element diffusion models \n , we found that the accretion event involving another peculiar daz white dwarf , nltt  888 , and that involving nltt  19868 are clearly distinguishable . \n the material accreted into the surface of nltt  888 is composed mainly of the iron - rich planetary core material , while the material accreted onto the surface of nltt  19868 is more akin to earth mantle material . in the case of nltt  19868 \n , the accretion event most likely occurred several diffusion timescales ago . \n although these scenarios appear reliable , details of the calculations rest upon uncertain diffusion timescale calculations . \n a.k . and s.v . \n acknowledge support from the grant agency of the czech republic ( 13 -

        "abstract": "Polluted white dwarfs provide key insights into planetary system evolution by analyzing planetary debris in their atmospheres. Approximately 25% of white dwarfs exhibit heavy elements, with some showing infrared excess linked to debris disks. This study focuses on NLTT 19868, a cool, polluted white dwarf, revealing a low iron-to-calcium abundance ratio indicative of mantle-like accretion material. Diffusion effects influence observed abundance patterns, offering clues to past accretion events. Comparisons with other white dwarfs suggest material composition ranging from iron-rich cores to mantle-like substances. This research highlights the potential of white dwarfs as archives of planetary system history and composition."

        "article": "the transformation , upon charge doping , of an antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulator into a superconducting ( sc ) metal and the role of af correlations in the appearance of superconductivity have challenged researchers since the discovery of high-@xmath12 superconductivity in cuprates . \n is the af order an indispensable component or a competitor for the high-@xmath12 phenomenon ? in a prototype high-@xmath12 cuprate la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 , \n the long - range af order is destroyed by doped holes way before the superconductivity sets in @xcite , which has led to a general belief that the spin frustration is a prerequisite for metallic conduction and superconductivity . \n the destructive impact of static spin order on superconductivity was further supported by the observation of sc suppression at a peculiar 1/8 doping in la@xmath6ba@xmath7cuo@xmath8 @xcite . on the other hand , spin excitations \n are often suggested to provide glue for sc pairing , implying the ultimate importance of af correlations , be they static or dynamic . besides , the incompatibility of static af order and sc may be not necessarily a general feature of cuprates . in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 \n ( @xmath1 is a rare - earth element ) , for instance , the long - range af order survives up to much higher doping levels than in la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 @xcite , though the possibility of its coexistence with superconductivity still remains to be clarified .    in strongly anisotropic high-@xmath12 cuprates \n , the @xmath0-axis charge transport appears to be remarkably sensitive to the spin ordering in cuo@xmath2 planes . in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals , for example , the @xmath0-axis resistivity @xmath13 exhibits a steep increase at the nel temperature @xmath14 @xcite . \n even relatively weak modifications of the spin structure such as spin - flop or metamagnetic transitions result in surprisingly large changes  by up to an order of magnitude  in the @xmath0-axis resistivity of both hole - doped la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 @xcite and electron - doped pr@xmath15la@xmath16ce@xmath17cuo@xmath8 @xcite and nd@xmath6ce@xmath17cuo@xmath8 crystals @xcite . \n this sensitivity of the interplane charge transport in cuprates to the spin order can be , and actually is , employed for tracing the evolution of the spin state with doping , temperature , or magnetic fields @xcite . \n while electrical resistivity measurements have proved to be a very convenient tool for mapping the magnetic phase diagrams in cuprates , their usage has an obvious limitation ; namely , they fail as the superconductivity sets in . \n because of this limitation , previous resistivity studies of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals @xcite could not clarify whether the long - range af order vanishes by the onset of superconductivity , or extends further , intervening the sc region . \n it sounds tempting to employ strong magnetic fields to suppress the superconductivity and to use the @xmath0-axis resistivity technique of detecting the spin order in otherwise inaccessible regions of the phase diagram . in the present paper , \n we use this approach to study the very region of the af - sc transformation in luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 and yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystals . \n @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystals with nonmagnetic rare - earth elements @xmath1@xmath5lu and y were grown by the flux method and their oxygen stoichiometry was tuned to the required level by high - temperature annealing with subsequent quenching @xcite . in order to ensure that no oxygen - enriched layer was formed at the crystal surface during the quenching process , \n one of the crystals was dissolved in acid in several steps ; resistivity measurements detected no considerable change in the sc transition upon the crystal s surface destruction . \n the @xmath0-axis resistivity @xmath13 was measured using the ac four - probe technique . to provide a homogeneous current flow along the @xmath0-axis \n , two current contacts were painted to almost completely cover the opposing @xmath18-faces of the crystal , while two voltage contacts were placed in small windows reserved in the current ones @xcite . \n the magnetoresistance ( mr ) was measured by sweeping temperature at fixed magnetic fields up to 16.5 t applied along the @xmath0 axis of the crystals . \n a representative @xmath13 curve obtained for a luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystal with a doping level slightly lower than required for the onset of superconductivity is shown in fig .  1 . \n in general , the @xmath0-axis resistivity in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals of non - sc composition exhibits two peculiar features upon cooling below room temperature , both of which can be seen in fig .  1 . \n the first one is a pronounced crossover at @xmath19 ( @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22k for the particular composition in fig .  1 ) , indicating a change  with decreasing temperature  of the dominating conductivity mechanism from some kind of thermally activated hopping to a coherent transport @xcite . \n it is worth noting that a similar coherent - incoherent crossover was observed in other layered oxides as well @xcite . \n the second feature is a sharp growth of the resistivity associated with the long - range af ordering @xcite . \n if the crystals were less homogeneous , the low - temperature resistivity upturn would be easy to confuse with a usual disorder - induced charge localization . however , this sharp resistivity anomaly with a characteristic negative peak in the derivative ( inset in fig . \n 1 ) is definitely related to the spin ordering at the nel temperature @xmath14 : it has been traced from the parent compositions @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath23 with well - known @xmath14 to avoid any doubt in its origin .    , of a luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath24 single crystal . \n the sharp growth of the resistivity upon cooling below @xmath25@xmath26k is caused by the af ordering . \n inset : anomaly in the normalized derivative @xmath27 associated with the nel transition.,width=287 ]    in carefully prepared crystals , the af transitions remain sharp for all compositions , including crystals with very low @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30k , that is @xmath3120 times lower than original @xmath32@xmath25@xmath33k in parent @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath23 . \n it is important to emphasize that the transitions at @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30k remain virtually as sharp as in undoped parent crystals even though spin freezing into a spin - glass state is usually expected for such low temperatures and high hole concentrations @xcite . \n moreover , the impact of the af ordering on @xmath13 does not weaken with decreasing nel temperature ; as can be seen in fig .  1 , the resistivity of the crystal with @xmath28@xmath29@xmath34k increases by more than 50% upon cooling below @xmath14 , while in crystals with @xmath28@xmath35@xmath36k the corresponding @xmath37 growth does not exceed 15 - 20% @xcite . \n what do these observations tell about the impact of doped holes on copper spins ? apparently , the sharp af transitions are hard to reconcile with strongly frustrated spin states and disordered spin textures in cuo@xmath2 planes that are usually expected to emerge in cuprates with doping @xcite . \n besides , a strong frustration - induced reduction of the staggered magnetization @xmath38 required to account for the decrease in @xmath14 would necessarily diminish the impact of the interplane spin ordering on @xmath37 , which again disagrees with observations . on the other hand , if the role of mobile doped holes is not to introduce a uniform spin frustration , but simply to break the long - range af order into two - dimensional domains in cuo@xmath2 planes , the observed behavior is easier to understand . in this case , it is the af domains in cuo@xmath2 planes that become the elementary magnetic units and the long - range af state should develop through ordering of their phases , which can occur rather abruptly . correspondingly , the @xmath14 evolution with doping should be governed by the decreasing af domain size , rather than @xmath38 . in turn , the ordering of af domains whose local staggered magnetization does nor change appreciably with hole doping leaves room for large changes in the @xmath0-axis resistivity even at low @xmath14 .    the @xmath14 and @xmath12 values determined from the @xmath0-axis resistivity of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals have been used to establish the doping - temperature phase diagram in fig .  2 . \n a peculiarity of @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals is that their doping level is determined both by the oxygen content and by the degree of its ordering @xcite . for characterizing the doping level , \n we use therefore the in - plane conductivity @xmath39 instead of the oxygen content ; the former is a good measure of the hole density given that the hole mobility stays almost constant in the doping region under discussion @xcite . \n ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ( @xmath1 = lu , tm , y ) crystals near the af - sc transformation . the af and sc transition temperatures , @xmath14 and @xmath12 , are presented as a function of the in - plane conductivity @xmath39 which is a good measure of the hole density in the shown doping region @xcite . \n the nel temperature was determined either at the position of the jump ( middle point ) in the derivative @xmath40 ( open circles ) , or at the position of the negative peak in @xmath40 ( solid circles).,width=326 ]    as can be seen in fig .  2 \n , the long - range af order in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 appears to be much more stable than in la@xmath6sr@xmath7cuo@xmath8 where it vanishes well in advance before the onset of superconductivity . in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 , \n the af phase boundary flattens upon approaching the sc compositions and hits the sc region , crossing the @xmath12 line at @xmath25@xmath41k . \n the observed overlap of the sc and af regions is very close to the area where @xmath42sr studies of yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 ceramics revealed the coexistence of superconductivity with spontaneous static magnetism @xcite . given that the @xmath0-axis resistivity studied here is sensitive to the _ interlayer _ spin ordering , the static magnetism detected by @xmath42sr @xcite should in fact be related to the three - dimensional af order . \n the superconductivity in @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 thus develops directly from the af - ordered state without any intervening paramagnetic or spin - glass region . \n cu@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystal for two oxygen concentrations near the af - sc transformation . for the superconducting composition @xmath43 , \n the data were taken at several magnetic fields  from zero up to 16.5 t  applied along the @xmath0 axis . \n the sharp upturn in the resistivity associated with the nel transition shows up as the superconductivity is suppressed with the magnetic field.,width=326 ]    according to the established phase diagram ( fig . \n 2 ) , an increase of the hole density in cuo@xmath2 planes by @xmath441% per cu ( from @xmath215% to @xmath256% , assuming the onset of superconductivity at @xmath255% doping ) turns an af @xmath1ba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystal without any sign of superconductivity into a bulk superconductor with @xmath9@xmath44@xmath45k . what happens with the af order upon entering the sc region , does it vanish abruptly ? \n zero - field @xmath13 curves measured on the same luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystal for two hole doping levels ( that differ by @xmath250.5 - 0.6% per cu ) indeed demonstrate a switch from an af state with @xmath13 sharply growing below @xmath14 to a sc state ( fig . \n however , when the superconductivity is suppressed with the magnetic field @xmath46@xmath47@xmath48 , the steep increase in @xmath37 associated with the af ordering is recovered back ( fig .  3 ) . moreover , the recovered nel temperature is merely several kelvin lower than for the non - sc composition ( upper curve in fig .  3 ) and \n the resistivity increase is not reduced appreciably either . as long as the sc in luba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 and yba@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 crystals is weak enough to be killed by the 16.5-t field , \n the unveiled @xmath13 curves keep demonstrating the anomalous growth below 15 - 20@xmath49k associated with the nel transition . \n this behavior indicates that , at least when superconductivity is suppressed with magnetic fields , the af order extends to considerably higher doping levels than the sc onset . \n consequently , at zero magnetic field the af and sc orders either coexist with each other in a certain range of doping , or the af order is frustrated in the sc state but revives as the superconductivity is destroyed with the magnetic field . \n a switching between the af and sc orders was indeed suggested based on early @xmath42sr studies @xcite , yet no further proofs were collected . \n the close location and even overlapping of the af and sc orders on the phase diagram raise another question of whether the af and sc orders reside in nanoscopically separated phases in cuo@xmath2 planes or coexist on the unit - cell scale , which calls for local microscopic tools to be clarified . \n j. m. tranquada , a. h. moudden , a. i. goldman , p. zolliker , d. e. cox , g. shirane , s. k. sinha , d. vaknin , d. c. johnston , m. s. alvarez , a. j. jacobson , j. t. lewandowski , and j. m. newsam , phys . rev . \n b * 38 * , 2477 ( 1988 ) .",
        "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between antiferromagnetic (AF) order and superconductivity (SC) in cuprates, particularly focusing on LuBa2Cu3O6+δ and YBa2Cu3O6+δ crystals. Using c-axis resistivity measurements under high magnetic fields, it is shown that AF order persists and overlaps with the superconducting region in the phase diagram. The findings challenge the traditional view that AF and SC orders are mutually exclusive and suggest potential coexistence or competition between them. The results indicate that superconductivity in these materials emerges directly from an AF-ordered state, emphasizing the need for further microscopic studies to clarify the interplay of these phases."

ray powder diffraction . \n the diffraction lines ( shown in fig.[xrd ] ) can be indexed with a tetragonal thcr@xmath3si@xmath3 type unit cell with lattice parameters @xmath58  and @xmath59  , in good agreement with those reported in ref .. the ac - susceptibility measurements were performed on heating with an ac field of 10 oe at 1111 hz . the real component ( fig.[chiac ] ) reveals the onset of diamagnetism and of bulk superconductivity below @xmath60 k.@xcite \n first - principles dft calculations of the electronic structure were performed using the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave method as implemented in the elk package  @xcite . for the exchange - correlation functional we used the generalized gradient approximation of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof  @xcite . \n the atomic positions used in the calculation are those obtained from room temperature x - ray diffraction . in order to calculate the electric field gradient ( efg ) tensor components @xmath61 we solved the poisson equation for the charge distribution to determine the electrostatic potential @xmath62 and derived @xmath61 from @xmath63 where @xmath64 runs over the nuclei at @xmath65 . \n since the efg tensor is extremely sensitive to the charge distribution a well converged basis set is needed to grant the convergence with respect to the efg tensor components . \n we used muffin tin radii of 2.6 @xmath66 for rb and 2.4 @xmath66 for fe and as , with @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the smallest muffin tin ( mt ) radius inside the mt spheres and @xmath69 the magnitude of the reciprocal space vectors . \n we choose 9 for the cut off of the angular momentum quantum number in the lattice harmonics expansion inside the mts . \n reciprocal space was sampled with the monkhorst - pack  @xcite scheme on a @xmath70 grid . \n a smearing of 270 mev was used within the methfessel - paxton scheme  @xcite and convergence of the efg components with respect to all these parameters has been carefully checked . \n once the efg tensor components are known the nqr frequency at @xmath0as and @xmath1rb can be calculated from eq . 1 in the main article . the obtained values , ( @xmath71)@xmath72 14.12 mhz and ( @xmath73)@xmath72 6.7 mhz are in good agreement with the experimental values ( @xmath71)@xmath7414.6 mhz and ( @xmath73)@xmath74 6.2 mhz and the discrepancy represents an estimate of the accuracy of the dft calculation which \n is known to not properly account for the electronic correlations . \n @xmath0as nqr and @xmath1rb nmr spectra were derived by recording the integral of the echo signal after a @xmath75 pulse sequence as a function of the irradiation frequency . at a few temperatures \n the @xmath0as nqr spectra was also obtained by merging the fourier transforms of half of the echo recorded at different frequencies but no relevant additional features appeared in the spectra . \n we point out that any tiny amount of spurious phases as feas and fe@xmath3as ( not detected in x - ray diffraction ) will not affect the @xmath0as nqr spectra since these materials are magnetically ordered and the internal field shifts the resonance frequency to much higher values . \n also in feas@xmath3 the @xmath0as nqr line is in a completely different frequency range.@xcite    the narrow @xmath13rb nqr spectra were obtained from the fourier transform of half of the echo signal obtained after the same echo pulse sequence . @xmath1rb \n nmr powder spectrum for the central @xmath76 transition is displayed in fig.[rbnmr ] . \n the spectrum is fully compatible with the @xmath1rb quadrupole frequency determined from the nqr spectra . \n @xmath0as spin - spin relaxation rate @xmath40 was derived in nqr by recording the decay of the echo amplitude @xmath77 after a @xmath75 pulse sequence . \n the decay could be fit in general with @xmath78 with @xmath79 . \n a value of @xmath80 lower than 2 and the slight temperature dependence of @xmath81 ( fig.[figt2 ] ) should be associated with redfield contribution to the relaxation @xmath82 . \n then one can write @xmath83 , with @xmath40 the spin - spin relaxation rate . in case of an anysotropic spin - lattice relaxation rate , \n et al_. @xcite calculated a general expression for @xmath84 . in case of a nuclear spin @xmath16 , with the @xmath85 axes of the efg along the @xmath86 axes one should have : @xmath87 where the symbols @xmath88 and @xmath89 refers to the external field orientation with respect to the crystallographic @xmath86 axis . \n in particular , @xmath90 corresponds to @xmath0as nqr @xmath14 . \n @xmath91 was determined by assuming an anisotropy in @xmath14 equal to the one found in electron - doped bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 @xcite . \n once the data have been corrected by redfield contribution one finds that @xmath0as @xmath40 is temperature independent ( fig.[figt2 ] ) , with @xmath92 . \n the deviation of @xmath93 from 2 , as it is expected in the case of nuclear dipolar interaction in a dense system @xcite is likely a consequence of the partial irradiation of the nqr spectrum . \n taking into account of @xmath94 corrections we have measured the @xmath95-dependence of @xmath0as nqr spectrum amplitude below 50 k and did not observe any significant change . \n @xmath1rb nmr @xmath14 was measured in a @xmath96 tesla magnetic field by irradiating just the high frequency shoulder of the powder spectrum of the central line shown in fig.[rbnmr ] , corresponding to grains with the @xmath86-axes perpendicular to @xmath97 . \n the recovery of @xmath1rb nmr central line magnetization after a saturation recovery pulse sequence was fit according to @xmath98 the recovery is shown in fig.[t1rbnmr ] and one observes , similarly to what one finds in @xmath0as nqr , two components appearing at low temperature . \n the long component were measured just in nmr since in nqr the very long @xmath1rb relaxations and the much lower signal intensity make the measurements quite demanding . \n the fast component , the only one present at @xmath99 k , was measured in nqr irradiating either @xmath1rb @xmath100 transition or @xmath2rb @xmath101 . \n the recovery of nuclear magnetization was fit according to the recovery laws expected for a magnetic relaxation mechanism @xcite @xmath102 for @xmath1rb and      for @xmath2rb . \n the ratio between the @xmath14 of the two nuclei for the fast relaxing component was measured at a few selected temperatures between 4 and 25 k and @xmath104 ( fig.[t1rbnqr ] ) , in good agreement with the ratio between the square of the gyromagnetic ratios of the two nuclei @xmath43 , confirming the adequacy of the recovery laws we have used to estimate @xmath14 and the fact that the relaxation is driven by electron spin fluctuations . \n notice that if the relaxation was driven by efg fluctuations @xmath14 should scale with the square of the nuclear electric quadrupole moment and one should have @xmath105 a value about 50 times smaller than the experimental one . \n we have measured the frequency dependence of @xmath0as @xmath14 across the nqr spectrum by decreasing the intensity of the radiofrequency field so that we irradiated a width of about 30 khz in the spectrum . \n we found that the recovery laws did not change significantly across the spectrum ( fig.[t1vsfreq ] ) . \n namely , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 show a negligible frequency dependence . \n it should be mentioned that @xmath32 and @xmath31 appear to slightly depend on the thermal history ( i.e. on the cooling rate ) , an aspect that will be the subject of future studies . \n finally , we have checked that @xmath32 , the amplitude of the slow relaxing component , is zero above 20 k by recording the recovery up to more than @xmath106 @xmath39 ( fig.[t1vsfreq ] ) .",
        "abstract": "This study investigates the synthesis, characterization, and analysis of the electronic and magnetic properties of the superconducting material RbFe2As2. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental techniques such as NQR and NMR spectroscopy, the research reveals key insights into the material's electronic structure, quadrupole interactions, and spin dynamics. The findings highlight the influence of annealing conditions on material stability, the sensitivity of the electric field gradient to charge distribution, and the temperature-dependent behavior of spin relaxation rates. These results provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between structural and electronic factors in superconducting compounds."

        "article": "the statistical mechanics of pure systems \n most prominently the topic of phase transitions and their associated surface phenomena  has been a subject of fairly intensive research in recent years . \n several physical principles for pure systems ( the gibbs phase rule , wulff construction , etc . ) have been put on a mathematically rigorous footing and , if necessary , supplemented with appropriate conditions ensuring their validity . \n the corresponding phenomena in systems with several mixed components , particularly solutions , have long been well - understood on the level of theoretical physics . \n however , they have not received much mathematically rigorous attention and in particular have not been derived rigorously starting from a local interaction . \n a natural task is to use the ideas from statistical mechanics of pure systems to develop a higher level of control for phase transitions in solutions . \n this is especially desirable in light of the important role that basic physics of these systems plays in sciences , both general ( chemistry , biology , oceanography ) and applied ( metallurgy , etc . ) . \n see e.g. @xcite for more discussion \n .    among the perhaps most interesting aspects of phase transitions in mixed systems is a dramatic _ phase separation _ in solutions upon freezing ( or boiling ) . \n a well - known example from `` real world '' is the formation of brine pockets in frozen sea water . here , two important physical phenomena are observed :    1 . \n migration of nearly all the salt into whatever portion of ice / water mixture remains liquid . \n clear evidence of _ facetting _ at the water - ice boundaries . \n quantitative analysis also reveals the following fact :    1 . \n salted water freezes at temperatures lower than the freezing point of pure water . \n this is the phenomenon of _ freezing point depression_.    phenomenon  ( 1 ) is what `` drives '' the physics of sea ice and is thus largely responsible for the variety of physical effects that have been observed , see e.g.  @xcite . \n notwithstanding , ( 13 ) are not special to the salt - water system ; they are shared by a large class of the so called _ non - volatile _ solutions . \n a discussion concerning the general aspects of freezing / boiling of solutions  often referred to as _ colligative _ properties  can be found in  @xcite .    of course , \n on a heuristic level , the above phenomena are far from mysterious . \n indeed , ( 1 ) follows from the observation that , macroscopically , the liquid phase provides a more hospitable environment for salt than the solid phase . \n then ( 3 ) results by noting that the migration of salt increases the entropic cost of freezing so the energy - entropy balance forces the transition point to a lower temperature . \n finally , concerning observation  ( 2 ) we note that , due to the crystalline nature of ice , the ice - water surface tension will be anisotropic . therefore , to describe the shape of brine pockets , a wulff construction has to be involved with the caveat that here the crystalline phase is on the outside . in summary \n , what is underlying these phenomena is a phase separation accompanied by the emergence of a crystal shape . in the context of pure systems , \n such topics have been well understood at the level of theoretical physics for quite some time @xcite and , recently ( as measured on the above time scale ) , also at the level of rigorous theorems in two  @xcite and higher  @xcite dimensions . \n the purpose of this and a subsequent paper is to study the qualitative nature of phenomena ( 13 ) using the formalism of equilibrium statistical mechanics . \n unfortunately , a microscopically realistic model of salted water / ice system is far beyond reach of rigorous methods . \n ( in fact , even in pure water , the phenomenon of freezing is so complex that crystalization in realistic models has only recently  and only marginally  been exhibited in computer simulations  @xcite . ) \n thus we will resort to a simplified version in which salt and both phases of water are represented by discrete random variables residing at sites of a regular lattice . \n for these models we show that phase separation dominates a non - trivial _ region _ of chemical potentials in the phase diagram  a situation quite unlike the pure system where phase separation can occur only at a single value ( namely , the transition value ) of the chemical potential . \n the boundary lines of the phase - separation region can be explicitly characterized and shown to agree with the approximate solutions of the corresponding problem in the physical - chemistry literature . \n the above constitutes the subject of the present paper . in a subsequent paper @xcite \n we will demonstrate that , for infinitesimal salt concentrations scaling appropriately with the size of the system , phase separation may still occur dramatically in the sense that a non - trivial fraction of the system suddenly melts ( freezes ) to form a pocket ( crystal ) . \n in these circumstances the amount of salt needed is proportional to the _ boundary _ of the system which shows that the onset of freezing - point depression is actually a surface phenomenon . on a qualitative level \n , most of the aforementioned conclusions should apply to general non - volatile solutions under the conditions when the solvent freezes ( or boils ) . \n notwithstanding , throughout this and the subsequent paper we will adopt the _ language _ of salted water and refer to the solid phase of the solvent as ice , to the liquid phase as liquid - water , and to the solute as salt .      our model will be defined on the @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice  @xmath1 . \n we will take the ( formal ) nearest - neighbor hamiltonian of the following form : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the inverse temperature ( henceforth incorporated into the hamitonian ) ,  @xmath4 and  @xmath5 are sites in  @xmath1 and  @xmath6 denotes a neighboring pair of sites . \n the quantities  @xmath7 ,  @xmath8 and  @xmath9 are the ice ( water ) , liquid ( water ) and salt variables , which will take values in  @xmath10 with the additional constraint @xmath11 valid at each site  @xmath4 . \n we will say that  @xmath12 indicates the _ presence of ice _ at  @xmath4 and , similarly ,  @xmath8 the _ presence of liquid _ at  @xmath4 . \n since a single water molecule can not physically be in an ice state , it is natural to interpret the phrase  @xmath12 as referring to the collective behavior of many particles in the vicinity of  @xmath4 which are enacting an ice - like state , though we do not formally incorporate such a viewpoint into our model . \n the various terms in are essentially self - explanatory : an interaction between neighboring ice points , similarly for neighboring liquid points ( we may assume these to be attractive ) , an energy penalty  @xmath13 for a simultaneous presence of salt and ice at one point , and , finally , fugacity terms for salt and liquid . for simplicity ( and tractability ) , there is no direct salt - salt interaction , except for the exclusion rule of at most one salt `` particle '' at each site . \n additional terms which could have been included are superfluous due to the constraint . \n we will assume throughout that  @xmath14 , so that the salt - ice interaction expresses the negative affinity of salt to the ice state of water . \n this term is entirely  and not subtly \n responsible for the general phenomenon of freezing point depression . \n we remark that by suitably renaming the variables , the hamiltonian in would just as well describe a system with boiling point elevation . \n as we said , the variables  @xmath7 and  @xmath8 indicate the presence of ice and liquid water at site  @xmath4 , respectively . \n the assumption  @xmath15 guarantees that _ something _ has to be present at  @xmath4 ( the concentration of water in water is unity ) ; what is perhaps unrealistic is the restriction of  @xmath7 and  @xmath8 to only the extreme values , namely  @xmath16 . suffice it to say that the authors are confident ( e.g. , on the basis of @xcite ) that virtually all the results in this note can be extended to the cases of continuous variables . \n however , we will not make any such mathematical claims ; much of this paper will rely heavily on preexisting technology which , strictly speaking , has only been made to work for the discrete case . \n a similar discussion applies , of course , to the salt variables . \n but here our restriction to  @xmath17 is mostly to ease the exposition ; virtually all of our results directly extend to the cases when  @xmath9 takes arbitrary ( positive ) real values according to some _ a priori _ distribution . \n it is not difficult to see that the `` ice - liquid sector '' of the general hamiltonian reduces to a ferromagnetic ising spin system . on a formal level \n , this is achieved by passing to the ising variables @xmath18 , which in light of the constraint gives @xmath19 by substituting these into , we arrive at the interaction hamiltonian : @xmath20 where the new parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 we remark that the third sum in is still written in terms of `` ice '' indicators so that  @xmath24 will have a well defined meaning even if  @xmath25 , which corresponds to prohibiting salt entirely at ice - occupied sites . \n ( notwithstanding , the bulk of this paper is restricted to finite  @xmath13 . ) \n using an appropriate restriction to finite volumes , the above hamitonian allows us to define the corresponding gibbs measures . \n we postpone any relevant technicalities to section  [ sec2.1 ] . \n the hamiltonian as written foretells the possibility of fluctuations in the salt concentration . \n however , this is _ not _ the situation which is of physical interest . \n indeed , in an open system it is clear that the salt concentration will , eventually , adjust itself until the system exhibits a pure phase . on the level of the description provided by it \n is noted that , as grand canonical variables , the salt particles can be explicitly integrated , the result being the ising model at coupling constant  @xmath21 and external field  @xmath26 , where @xmath27 in this context , phase coexistence is confined to the region  @xmath28 , i.e. , a simple curve in the @xmath29-plane . unfortunately , as is well known  @xcite , not much insight on the subject of _ phase separation _ is to be gained by studying the ising magnet in an external field . \n indeed , under ( for example ) minus boundary conditions , once  @xmath22 exceeds a particular value , a droplet will form which all but subsumes the allowed volume . \n the transitional value of  @xmath22 scales inversely with the linear size of the system ; the exact constants and the subsequent behavior of the droplet depend on the details of the boundary conditions . \n the described `` failure '' of the grand canonical description indicates that the correct ensemble in this case is the one with a fixed amount of salt per unit volume . \n ( the technical definition uses conditioning from the grand canonical measure ; see section  [ sec2.1 ] . ) \n this ensemble is physically more relevant because , at the moment of freezing , the salt typically does not have enough `` mobility '' to be gradually released from the system . \n it is noted that , once the total amount of salt is fixed , the chemical potential  @xmath30 drops out of the problem  the relevant parameter is now the salt concentration . as will be seen in section  [ sec2 ] , in our ising - based model of the solvent - solute system , fixing the salt concentration generically leads to _ sharp _ phase separation in the ising configuration . \n moreover , this happens for an _ interval _ of values of the magnetic field  @xmath22 . \n indeed , the interplay between the salt concentration and the actual external field will demand a particular value of the magnetization , even under conditions which will force a droplet ( or ice crystal , depending on the boundary condition ) into the system . \n [ rem0 ] we finish by noting that , while the parameter @xmath22 is formally unrelated to temperature , it does to a limited extent play the role of temperature in that it reflects the _ a priori _ amount of preference of the system for water _ vs _ ice . thus the natural phase diagram to study is in the @xmath31-plane . \n the reasoning which led to formula allows for an immediate heuristic explanation of our principal results . \n the key simplification  which again boils down to the absence of salt - salt interaction  is that for any ising configuration , the amalgamated contribution of salt , i.e. , the gibbs weight summed over salt configurations , depends only on the overall magnetization and not on the details of how the magnetization gets distributed about the system . in systems of linear scale \n @xmath32 , let  @xmath33 denote the canonical partition function for the ising magnet with constrained overall magnetization  @xmath34 . \n the total partition function  @xmath35 at fixed salt concentration  @xmath36 can then be written as @xmath37 where  @xmath38 denotes the sum of the salt part of the boltzmann weight  which only depends on the ising spins via the total magnetization  @xmath34over all salt configurations with concentration  @xmath36 . \n as usual , the physical values of the magnetization are those bringing the dominant contribution to the sum in . \n let us recapitulate the standard arguments by first considering the case @xmath39 ( which implies @xmath40 ) , i.e. , the usual ising system at external field @xmath22 . \n here we recall that  @xmath41 can approximately be written as @xmath42},\\ ] ] where  @xmath43 is a suitably chosen constant and  @xmath44 is a ( normalized ) canonical free energy . \n the principal fact about @xmath44 is that it vanishes for  @xmath45 in the interval  @xmath46 $ ] , where  @xmath47 denotes the spontaneous magnetization of the ising model at coupling  @xmath21 , while it is strictly positive and strictly convex for  @xmath45 with  @xmath48 . \n the presence of the `` flat piece '' on the graph of  @xmath44 is directly responsible for the existence of the phase transition in the ising model : for  @xmath49 the dominant contribution to the grand canonical partition function comes from  @xmath50 while for  @xmath51 the dominant values of the overall magnetization are  @xmath52 . \n thus , once  @xmath53which happens for  @xmath54 with  @xmath55 whenever  @xmath56a phase transition occurs at  @xmath57 . \n the presence of salt variables drastically changes the entire picture . \n indeed , as we will see in theorem [ thm1 ] , the salt partition function @xmath38 will exhibit a nontrivial exponential behavior which is characterized by a _ strictly convex _ free energy . the resulting exponential growth rate of @xmath58 for @xmath59 is thus no longer a function with a flat piece  instead , for each  @xmath22 there is a _ \n unique _ value of  @xmath45 that optimizes the corresponding free energy . \n notwithstanding ( again , due to the absence of salt - salt interactions ) once that  @xmath45 has been selected , the spin configurations are the typical ising configurations with overall magnetizations  @xmath60 . in particular , whenever  @xmath35 is dominated by values of  @xmath60 for an  @xmath61 , a _ \n macroscopic droplet _ develops in the system . \n thus , due to the one - to - one correspondence between  @xmath22 and the optimal value of  @xmath45 , phase separation occurs for an _ interval _ of values of  @xmath22 at any positive concentration ; see fig . \n [ fig1 ] . \n we finish with an outline of the remainder of this paper and some discussion of the companion paper  @xcite . in section  [ sec2 ] \n we define precisely the model of interest and state our main results concerning the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding measure on spin and salt configurations with fixed concentration of salt . \n along with the results comes a description of the phase diagram and a discussion of freezing - point depression , phase separation , etc . , \n see section  [ sec2.3 ] . \n our main results are proved in section  [ sec3 ] . in  @xcite \n we investigate the asymptotic of infinitesimal salt concentrations . \n interestingly , we find that , in order to induce phase separation , the concentration has to scale at least as the inverse linear size of the system . \n with the ( formal ) hamiltonian in mind , we can now start on developing the _ mathematical _ layout of the problem . to define the model , we will need to restrict attention to finite subsets of the lattice . \n we will mostly focus on rectangular boxes @xmath62 of @xmath63 sites centered at the origin . \n our convention for the boundary ,  @xmath64 , of the set @xmath65 will be the collection of sites outside  @xmath66 with a neighbor inside  @xmath66 . \n for each @xmath67 , we have the water and salt variables , @xmath68 and @xmath17 . on the boundary \n , we will consider fixed configurations  @xmath69 ; most of the time we will be discussing the cases @xmath70 or  @xmath71 , referred to as plus and minus boundary conditions . since there is no salt - salt interaction , we may as well set  @xmath72 for all  @xmath73 . \n we will start by defining the interaction hamiltonian . \n let  @xmath65 be a finite set . for a spin configuration  @xmath69 and the pair  @xmath74 of spin and salt configurations \n , we let @xmath75 here , as before ,  @xmath6 denotes a nearest - neighbor pair on  @xmath1 and the parameters  @xmath21 ,  @xmath22 and  @xmath13 are as discussed above . \n ( in light of the discussion from section  [ sec1.3 ] the last term in has been omitted . ) the probability distribution of the pair  @xmath74 takes the usual gibbs - boltzmann  form : @xmath76 where the normalization constant ,  @xmath77 , is the partition function . the distributions in  @xmath78 with the plus and minus boundary conditions will be denoted by  @xmath79 and  @xmath80 , respectively .    for reasons discussed before we will be interested in the problems with a fixed salt concentration @xmath81 $ ] . in finite volume \n , we take this to mean that the total amount of salt , @xmath82 is fixed . to simplify future discussions \n , we will adopt the convention that `` concentration  @xmath36 '' means that @xmath83 , i.e. , @xmath84 . we may then define the finite volume gibbs probability measure with salt concentration  @xmath36 and plus ( or minus ) boundary conditions denoted by  @xmath85 ( or  @xmath86 ) . in light of , \n these are given by the formulas @xmath87 both measures  @xmath88 depend on the parameters  @xmath21 and  @xmath13 in the hamiltonian . \n however , we will always regard these as fixed and suppress them from the notation whenever possible .      in order to describe our first set of results \n , we will need to bring to bear a few standard facts about the ising model . \n for each spin configuration @xmath89 let us define the overall magnetization in  @xmath78 by the formula @xmath90 let @xmath91 denote the magnetization of the ising model with coupling constant  @xmath21 and external field  @xmath92 . \n as is well known , cf the proof of theorem  [ thm3.1 ] , @xmath93 continuously ( and strictly ) increases from the value of the spontaneous magnetization @xmath94 to one as @xmath22 sweeps through @xmath95 . \n in particular , for each @xmath96 , there exists a unique @xmath97 such that @xmath98 . \n next we will use the above quantities to define the function  @xmath99 , which represents the canonical free energy of the ising model in  . as it turns out \n see theorem  [ thm3.1 ] in section  [ sec3]we simply have @xmath100 as already mentioned , if  @xmath101 , where  @xmath102 is the critical coupling constant of the ising model , then @xmath103 and thus @xmath104 for @xmath105 $ ] . \n ( since  @xmath106 only for  @xmath56 , the resulting `` flat piece '' on the graph of  @xmath107 appears only in dimensions  @xmath56 . ) from the perspective of the large - deviation theory , cf  @xcite , @xmath107 is the large - deviation rate function for the magnetization in the ( unconstrained ) ising model ; see again theorem  [ thm3.1 ] . \n let @xmath108 denote the entropy function of the bernoulli distribution with parameter  @xmath109 . \n ( we will set @xmath110 whenever @xmath111 $ ] . ) for each @xmath112 , each @xmath81 $ ] and each @xmath113 $ ] , let @xmath114 as we will show in section  [ sec3 ] , this quantity represents the entropy of configurations with fixed salt concentration  @xmath36 , fixed overall magnetization  @xmath45 and fixed fraction  @xmath115 of the salt residing `` on the plus spins '' ( and fraction @xmath116 `` on the minus spins '' ) . \n having defined all relevant quantities , we are ready to state our results . \n we begin with a large - deviation principle for the magnetization in the measures  @xmath88 :    [ thm1 ] let @xmath117 and @xmath14 be fixed . for each @xmath118 , \n each @xmath119 and each @xmath112 , we have @xmath120 here @xmath121 is given by @xmath122}{\\mathscr{g}}_{h , c}(m,\\theta),\\ ] ] where @xmath123 the function @xmath121 is finite and strictly convex on  @xmath124 with @xmath125 . \n furthermore , the unique minimizer @xmath126 of @xmath121 is continuous in both  @xmath36 and  @xmath22 and strictly increasing in  @xmath22 .    on the basis of the above large - deviation result \n , we can now characterize the typical configurations of the measures  @xmath88 . \n consider the ising model with coupling constant  @xmath21 and zero external field and let  @xmath127 be the corresponding gibbs measure in volume  @xmath78 and  @xmath128-boundary condition . \n our main result in this section is then as follows :    [ thm2 ] let  @xmath117 and  @xmath14 be fixed . \n let @xmath118 and @xmath119 , and define two sequences of probability measures  @xmath129 on  @xmath130 $ ] by the formula @xmath131\\bigr)=p_l^{\\pm , c , h}(m_l\\le ml^d ) , \\qquad m\\in[-1,1].\\ ] ] the measures @xmath129 allow us to write the spin marginal of the measure  @xmath88 as a convex combination of the ising measures with fixed magnetization ; i.e. , for any set \n @xmath132 of configurations @xmath133 , we have @xmath134 moreover , if  @xmath126 denotes the unique minimizer of the function  @xmath121 from , then the following properties are true :    1 .   given the spin configuration on a finite set @xmath65 , the salt variables on  @xmath66 are asymptotically independent . explicitly , for each finite set @xmath65 and any two configurations @xmath135 and @xmath136 , @xmath137 where the numbers  @xmath138 $ ] are uniquely determined by the equations @xmath139 2 . \n the measure  @xmath129 converges weakly to a point mass at  @xmath126 , @xmath140 in particular , the ising - spin marginal of the measure  @xmath88 is asymptotically supported on the usual ising spin configurations with the overall magnetization  @xmath141 , where  @xmath45 minimizes  @xmath121 . \n the fact that conditioning @xmath88 on a fixed value of magnetization produces the ising measure under same conditioning  which is the content of  is directly related to the absence of salt - salt interaction . \n the principal conclusions of the previous theorem are thus parts  ( 1 ) and  ( 2 ) , which state that the presence of a particular amount of salt _ forces _ the ising sector to choose a particular value of magnetization density . \n the underlying variational principle provides insight into the physical mechanism of phase separation upon freezing of solutions . \n ( we refer the reader back to section  [ sec1.4 ] for the physical basis of these considerations . ) \n we will proceed by discussing the consequences of these results for the phase diagram of the model and , in particular , the phenomenon of freezing point depression . \n theorems  [ thm1 ] and  [ thm2 ] are proved in section  [ sec3.2 ] . \n [ fig1 ]    . \n the horizontal axis marks the concentration of the salt in the system , the vertical line represents the external field acting on the ising spins  see formula  . for positive concentrations @xmath142 , the system stays in the liquid - water phase throughout a non - trivial range of negative values of  @xmath22a manifestation of the freezing - point depression . for  @xmath143 in the shaded region , a non - trivial fraction of the system is frozen into ice . \n once @xmath143 is on the left of the shaded region , the entire system is in the ice state . for moderate values of  @xmath13 , \n the type of convexity of the transition lines may change from concave to convex near  @xmath144 ; see the companion paper  @xcite . \n , width=336 ]    . \n the horizontal axis marks the concentration of the salt in the system , the vertical line represents the external field acting on the ising spins  see formula  . for positive concentrations @xmath142 , the system stays in the liquid - water phase throughout a non - trivial range of negative values of  @xmath22a manifestation of the freezing - point depression \n . for  @xmath143 in the shaded region , a non - trivial fraction of the system \n is frozen into ice . \n once @xmath143 is on the left of the shaded region , the entire system is in the ice state . for moderate values of  @xmath13 , \n the type of convexity of the transition lines may change from concave to convex near  @xmath144 ; see the companion paper  @xcite . \n , width=336 ]      the representation along with the asymptotic allow us to characterize the distribution  @xmath88 in terms of the canonical ensemble of the ising ferromagnet . indeed \n , these formulas imply that the distribution of ising spins induced by  @xmath88 is very much like that in the measure  @xmath127 conditioned on the event that the overall magnetization  @xmath145 is near the value  @xmath146 . as a consequence , the asymptotic statements ( e.g. , the wulff construction ) that have been ( or will be ) established for the spin configurations in the ising model with fixed magnetization will automatically hold for the spin - marginal of the  @xmath88 as well . \n a particular question of interest in this paper is phase separation . \n recall that  @xmath47 denotes the spontaneous magnetization of the ising model at coupling  @xmath21 . \n then we can anticipate the following conclusions about typical configurations in measure  @xmath88 :    1 .   if @xmath147 , then the entire system ( with plus boundary condition ) will look like the plus state of the ising model whose external field is adjusted so that the overall magnetization on the scale @xmath148 is roughly @xmath146 . \n 2 .   if @xmath149 , then the system ( with minus boundary condition ) will look like the ising minus state with similarly adjusted external field . \n if @xmath150 , then , necessarily , the system exhibits phase separation in the sense that typical configurations feature a large droplet of one phase inside the other . the volume fraction taken by the droplet is such that the overall magnetization is near @xmath151 . \n the outer phase of the droplet agrees with the boundary condition .    the cases ( 1 - 2 ) with opposite boundary conditions  that is , the minus boundary conditions in  ( 1 ) and the plus boundary conditions in  ( 2)are still as stated \n ; the difference is that now there has to be a large contour near the boundary flipping to the `` correct '' boundary condition . \n [ rem1 ] we have no doubt that the aforementioned conclusions ( 1 - 3 ) hold for all @xmath56 and all @xmath101 ( with a proper definition of the _ droplet _ in part  ( 3 ) , of course ) . however , the depth of conclusion  ( 3 ) depends on the level of understanding wulff construction , which is at present rather different in dimensions  @xmath152 and  @xmath153 . \n specifically , while in @xmath152 the results of  @xcite allow us to claim that for all @xmath101 and all magnetizations @xmath61 , the system will exhibit a unique large contour with appropriate properties , in @xmath153 this statement is known to hold  @xcite only in `` @xmath154-sense '' and only for @xmath61 which are near the endpoints . \n ( moreover , not all values of  @xmath101 are , in principle , permitted ; cf  @xcite for a recent improvement of these restrictions . ) \n we refer to  @xcite for an overview of the situation .    notwithstanding the technical difficulties of wulff construction , \n the above allows us to characterize the phase diagram of the model at hand . as indicated in fig . \n [ fig1 ] , the @xmath155 and @xmath156 quadrant splits into three distinct parts : the _ liquid - water _ \n region , the _ ice _ region and the _ phase separation _ region , which correspond to the situations in  ( 1 - 3 ) , respectively . \n the boundary lines of the phase - separation region are found by setting @xmath157 which in light of strict monotonicity of @xmath158 allows us to calculate  @xmath22 as a function of  @xmath36 . \n the solutions of can be obtained on the basis of the following observation :    [ prop2b ] let @xmath105 $ ] and @xmath81 $ ] and define the quantities  @xmath159 by  . \n let  @xmath22 be the solution to @xmath160 . \n then we have : @xmath161 in particular , there exist two continuous and decreasing functions @xmath162 $ ] with @xmath163 for all @xmath142 , such that @xmath164 is equivalent to @xmath165 for all @xmath142 . \n proposition  [ prop2b ] is proved at the very end of section  [ sec3.2 ] . \n here is an informal interpretation of this result : the quantities @xmath166 represent the _ mole fractions _ of salt in liquid - water and ice , respectively . in mathematical terms ,  @xmath167 is the probability of having a salt particle on a given plus spin , and  @xmath168 is the corresponding quantity for minus spins , see  . \n formula quantifies the shift of the chemical potential of the solvent ( which is given by @xmath169 in this case ) due to the presence of the solute . \n this is a manifestation of _ freezing point depression _ , see also remark  [ rem0 ] . in the asymptotic when @xmath170 we have @xmath171 this relation , derived in standard chemistry and physics books under the auspicies of the `` usual approximations \n , '' is an essential ingredient in the classical analyses of colligative properties of solutions  @xcite . here \n the derivation is a direct consequence of a microscopic ( albeit simplistic ) model which further offers the possibility of systematically calculating higher - order corrections . \n the proofs of our main results are , more or less , straightforward exercises in large - deviation analysis of gibbs distributions . \n we first state and prove a couple of technical lemmas ; the actual proofs come in section  [ sec3.2 ] . \n the starting point of the proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] ( and , consequently , theorem  [ thm2 ] ) is the following large - deviation principle for the ising model at zero external field :    [ thm3.1 ] consider the ising model with coupling constant @xmath172 and zero external field . \n let  @xmath127 be the corresponding ( grand canonical ) gibbs measure in volume  @xmath78 and  @xmath128-boundary conditions . \n then for all @xmath173 $ ] , @xmath174 where  @xmath145 is as in and  @xmath175 is as defined in . \n proof the claim is considered standard , see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? \n * section  ii.1 ) , and follows by a straightforward application of the thermodynamic relations between the free energy , magnetization and external field . for completeness ( and reader \n s convenience ) we will provide a proof .    consider the function  @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the expectation with respect to  @xmath127 , and let  @xmath178 . \n the limit exists by subadditivity arguments and is independent of the boundary condition . \n the function  @xmath179 is convex on  @xmath180 , real analytic ( by the lee - yang theorem  @xcite ) on  @xmath181 , and hence it is strictly convex on  @xmath180 . by the  @xmath182 symmetry \n there is a cusp at  @xmath57 whenever  @xmath183 . \n it follows that for each  @xmath184 there is a unique  @xmath185 such that  @xmath186 , with  @xmath187 increasing continuously from  @xmath188 to  @xmath189 as  @xmath45 increases from  @xmath190 to  @xmath191 . \n the plus - minus symmetry shows that a similar statement holds for the magnetizations in  @xmath192 $ ] . \n let  @xmath193 denote the legendre transform of  @xmath194 , i.e. ,  @xmath195 $ ] . by the above properties of  @xmath179 we infer that  @xmath196 when  @xmath197 and  @xmath198 , while  @xmath199 for  @xmath105 $ ] . applying the grtner - ellis theorem ( see ( * ? ? ? \n * theorem  v.6 ) or  ( * ? ? ? \n * theorem  2.3.6 ) ) , we then have with  @xmath200 for all  @xmath201$]which is the set of so called exposed points of  @xmath193 . since @xmath202 and the derivative of  @xmath203 is  @xmath187 , this  @xmath175 is given by the integral in . to prove when  @xmath105 $ ] , we must note that the left - hand side of is nonpositive and concave in  @xmath45 . \n ( this follows by partitioning  @xmath78 into two parts with their own private magnetizations and disregarding the interaction through the boundary . ) \n since  @xmath44 tends to zero as  @xmath45 tends to  @xmath204 we thus have that for  @xmath105 $ ] as well . \n the `` first '' part of the grtner - ellis theorem ( * ? ? ? \n * theorem  v.6 ) actually guarantees the following _ large - deviation principle _ : @xmath205 for any closed set  @xmath206 while @xmath207}\\phi^\\star(m)\\ ] ] for any open set  @xmath208 . \n ( here  @xmath209 for  @xmath173 $ ] and @xmath210 otherwise . ) \n the above proof follows by specializing to @xmath211-neighborhoods of a given  @xmath45 and letting  @xmath212 . \n the  @xmath105 $ ] cases  i.e , the non - exposed points  have to be dealt with separately . \n the above is the core of our proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] . \n the next step will be to bring the quantities  @xmath36 and  @xmath22 into play . \n this , as we shall see , is easily done if we condition on the total magnetization . \n ( the cost of this conditioning will be estimated by . ) indeed , as a result of the absence of salt - salt interaction , the conditional measure can be rather precisely characterized . \n let us recall the definition of the quantity  @xmath213 from which represents the total amount of salt in the system . \n for any spin configuration  @xmath89 and any salt configuration  @xmath214 , let us introduce the quantity @xmath215 representing the total amount of salt `` on the plus spins . '' \n then we have :    [ lemma3.2 ] for any fixed spin configuration  @xmath216 , all salt configurations @xmath217 with the same  @xmath213 and  @xmath218 have the same probability in the conditional measure  @xmath219 . \n moreover , for any  @xmath220 with @xmath221 and for any  @xmath173 $ ] , @xmath222 where the normalization constant is given by @xmath223 here  @xmath177 is the expectation with respect to  @xmath127 . \n proof the fact that all salt configurations with given  @xmath213 and  @xmath218 have the same probability in  @xmath219 is a consequence of the observation that the salt - dependent part of the hamiltonian depends only on  @xmath218 . \n the relations ( [ 3.3][3.4 ] ) follow by a straightforward rewrite of the overall boltzmann weight . \n the characterization of the conditional measure @xmath224 from lemma  [ lemma3.2 ] allows us to explicitly evaluate the configurational entropy carried by the salt . \n specifically , given a spin configuration  @xmath89 and numbers  @xmath225 , let @xmath226 the salt entropy is then the rate of exponential growth of the size of  @xmath227 which can be related to the quantity @xmath228 from as follows :    [ lemma3.3 ] for each  @xmath229 and each  @xmath230 there exists a number  @xmath231 such that the following is true for any @xmath225 , any  @xmath112 that obey @xmath232 , @xmath233 and any  @xmath234 : if @xmath89 is a spin configuration with @xmath235 , then @xmath236    proof we want to distribute  @xmath237 salt particles over  @xmath238 positions , such that exactly @xmath239 of them land on  @xmath240 plus sites and  @xmath241 on @xmath242 minus sites . \n this can be done in latexmath:[\\[\\label{3.8a }    number of ways . \n now all quantities scale proportionally to  @xmath238 which , applying stirling s formula , shows that the first term is within , say ,  @xmath244 multiples of @xmath245 once  @xmath234 , with  @xmath246 depending only on  @xmath247 . \n a similar argument holds also for the second term with  @xmath115 replaced by  @xmath116 and  @xmath45 by  @xmath248 . combining these expressions \n we get that  @xmath249 is within  @xmath250 multiples of  @xmath251 once  @xmath32 is sufficiently large .    for the proof of theorem  [ thm2 ] \n , we will also need an estimate on how many salt configurations in  @xmath227 take given values in a finite subset  @xmath252 . \n to that extent , for each  @xmath253 and each  @xmath135 we will define the quantity @xmath254 as a moment s thought reveals ,  @xmath255 can be interpreted as the probability that  @xmath256 occurs in ( essentially ) any homogeneous product measure on  @xmath214 conditioned to have  @xmath257 and  @xmath258 . \n it is therefore not surprising that , for spin configurations  @xmath259 with given magnetization ,  @xmath260 will tend to a product measure on  @xmath261 . \n a precise characterization of this limit is as follows :    [ lemma3.4 ] for each  @xmath262 , each  @xmath263 and each  @xmath230 there exists  @xmath231 such that the following holds for all  @xmath234 , all  @xmath252 with  @xmath264 , all  @xmath45 with  @xmath232 and all  @xmath265 $ ] for which @xmath266 satisfy  @xmath267 $ ] : if  @xmath89 is a spin configuration such that  @xmath235 and  @xmath135 is a salt configuration in  @xmath66 , then @xmath268    proof we will expand on the argument from lemma  [ lemma3.3 ] . \n indeed , from   we have an expression for the denominator in . as to the numerator , introducing the quantities @xmath269 and the shorthand @xmath270 the same reasoning as we used to prove allows us to write the object  @xmath271 as @xmath272 , where the various parameters are as follows : the quantities @xmath273 represent the total number of pluses and minuses in the system , respectively , @xmath274 are the numbers of salt particles on pluses and minuses , and , finally , @xmath275 are the corresponding quantities for the volume  @xmath66 , respectively .    since   and the restrictions on  @xmath232 and @xmath265 $ ] imply that  @xmath276 ,  @xmath277 ,  @xmath278 ,  @xmath279 ,  @xmath280 and  @xmath281 all scale proportionally to  @xmath238 , uniformly in  @xmath259 and  @xmath282 , while  @xmath283 and  @xmath284 are bounded by  @xmath285which by our assumption is less than  @xmath286we are in a regime where it makes sense to seek an asymptotic form of quantity  @xmath287 . using the bounds @xmath288 which are valid for all integers  @xmath289 and  @xmath290 with  @xmath291 \n , we easily find that @xmath292 since  @xmath293 and  @xmath294 as  @xmath295 , while  @xmath283 , @xmath296 , @xmath284 and  @xmath297 stay bounded , the desired claim follows by taking  @xmath32 sufficiently large . \n the reader may have noticed that , in most of our previous arguments , @xmath115 and  @xmath45 were restricted to be away from the boundary values . \n to control the situation near the boundary values , we have to prove the following claim :    [ lemma3.5 ] for each  @xmath298 and each  @xmath299 , let  @xmath300 be the event @xmath301 then for each  @xmath118 and each  @xmath119 there exists an  @xmath262 such that @xmath302    proof we will split the complement of @xmath300 into four events and prove the corresponding estimate for each of them . \n we begin with the event  @xmath303 . \n the main tool will be stochastic domination by a product measure . \n consider the usual partial order on spin configurations defined by putting  @xmath304 whenever  @xmath305 for all  @xmath4 . \n let @xmath306 be the conditional probability that  @xmath307 occurs given a spin configuration  @xmath308 in @xmath309 and a salt configuration  @xmath310 in  @xmath78 , optimized over all  @xmath308 , @xmath310 and also  @xmath311 and the system size . \n since  @xmath312 reduces to ( the exponential of ) the local interaction between  @xmath313 and its ultimate neighborhood , we have  @xmath314 . \n using standard arguments it now follows that the spin marginal of  @xmath88 stochastically dominates the product measure  @xmath315 defined by  @xmath316 for all  @xmath4 . \n in particular , we have @xmath317 let @xmath318 . \n then  @xmath319namely , the expectation of  @xmath313 with respect to  @xmath315exceeds the negative of  @xmath320 and so cramr s theorem ( see ( * ? ? ? \n * theorem  i.4 ) or ( * ? ? ? * theorem  2.1.24 ) ) implies that the probability on the right - hand side decays to zero exponentially in  @xmath238 , i.e. , @xmath321 the opposite side of the interval of magnetizations , namely , the event @xmath322 , is handled analogously ( with  @xmath323 now focusing on  @xmath324 instead of  @xmath325 ) . \n the remaining two events , marking when  @xmath218 is either less than  @xmath211 or larger than  @xmath320 times the total number of plus spins , are handled using a similar argument combined with standard convexity estimates . \n let us consider the event  @xmath326which contains the event  @xmath327and let us emphasize the dependence of the underlying probability distribution on  @xmath13 by writing  @xmath88 as  @xmath328 . \n let  @xmath329 denote the expectation with respect to  @xmath328 and note that  @xmath330 . \n we begin by using the chernoff bound to get @xmath331 a routine application of jensen s inequality gives us @xmath332 it thus suffices to prove that there exists a  @xmath333 such that @xmath334 is positive . \n ( indeed , we take  @xmath211 to be strictly less than this number and set  @xmath335 to observe that the right - hand side decays exponentially in  @xmath238 . ) to show this we write @xmath336 as the sum of  @xmath337 over all  @xmath311 . \n looking back at , we then have @xmath338 , where  @xmath323 is now evaluated for  @xmath339 , and so @xmath340 thus , once  @xmath341 , the probability  @xmath342 decays exponentially in  @xmath238 .    as to the complementary event , @xmath343 \n , we note that this is contained in  @xmath344 , where  @xmath345 counts the number of plus spins with no salt on it . \n since we still have  @xmath346 , the proof boils down to the same argument as before .      on the basis of the above observations , the proofs of our main theorems \n are easily concluded . \n however , instead of theorem  [ thm1 ] we will prove a slightly stronger result of which the large - deviation part of theorem  [ thm1 ] is an easy corollary . \n [ thm3.5 ] let  @xmath117 and  @xmath347 be fixed . for each  @xmath348 , \n each  @xmath119 and each  @xmath112 , let  @xmath349 be the set of all @xmath350 for which @xmath351 and @xmath352 hold \n . then @xmath353 \\end{subarray } } { \\mathscr{g}}_{h , c}(m',\\theta'),\\ ] ] where  @xmath354 is as in . \n proof since the size of the set  @xmath227 depends only on the overall magnetization , let  @xmath355 denote this size for the configurations  @xmath259 with  @xmath356 . \n first we note that , by lemma  [ lemma3.2 ] , @xmath357 where @xmath358 here  @xmath359 is the normalization constant from which in the present formulation can also be interpreted as the sum of @xmath360 over the relevant ( discrete ) values of  @xmath45 and  @xmath115 . \n let  @xmath361 denote the sum of  @xmath362 over all  @xmath363 and  @xmath364 for which  @xmath365 and  @xmath366 are integers and @xmath367 and  @xmath368 . \n ( this is exactly the set of magnetizations and spin - salt overlaps contributing to the set  @xmath369 . ) \n applying to extract the exponential behavior of the last probability in , and using to do the same for the quantity @xmath355 , we get @xmath370 where  @xmath247 is as in . as a consequence of the above estimate we have @xmath371 for any  @xmath112 and any  @xmath372 . \n next we will attend to the denominator in . \n pick  @xmath373 and consider the set latexmath:[\\[{\\mathcal m}_\\delta=\\bigl\\{(m,\\theta)\\colon    write  @xmath359 as a sum of two terms , @xmath375 , with  @xmath376 obtained by summing @xmath377 over the admissible  @xmath378 and  @xmath379 collecting the remaining terms . by lemma  [ lemma3.5 ] we know that  @xmath380 decays exponentially in  @xmath238 and so the decisive contribution to  @xmath359 comes from  @xmath376 . assuming that  @xmath381 , let us cover @xmath382 by finite number of sets of the form  @xmath383\\times[\\theta_\\ell'-\\epsilon,\\theta_\\ell'+\\epsilon]$ ] , where  @xmath384 and  @xmath385 are such that  @xmath386 and  @xmath387 are integers . \n then  @xmath376 can be bounded as in @xmath388 moreover , the right - hand side is bounded by the left - hand side times a polynomial in  @xmath32 . taking logarithms , dividing by  @xmath238 , taking the limit  @xmath295 , refining the cover and applying the continuity of  @xmath389 allows us to conclude that @xmath390}{\\mathscr{g}}_{h , c}(m,\\theta).\\ ] ] combining these observations , is proved . \n proof of theorem  [ thm1 ] the conclusion follows from by similar arguments that prove . \n the only remaining thing to prove is the strict convexity of  @xmath121 and continuity and monotonicity of its minimizer . \n first we note that  @xmath391 is strictly convex on the set of  @xmath115 where it is finite , which is a simple consequence of the strict convexity of  @xmath392 . \n hence , for each  @xmath45 , there is a unique  @xmath393 which minimizes  @xmath391 . \n our next goal is to show that , for  @xmath394 , the solution  @xmath393 will satisfy the inequality @xmath395 ( a heuristic reason for this is that  @xmath396 corresponds to the situation when the salt is distributed independently of the underlying spins . \n this is the dominating strategy for  @xmath397 ; once  @xmath14 it is clear that the fraction of salt on plus spins _ must _ increase . ) \n a formal proof runs as follows : we first note that  @xmath398 solves for  @xmath115 from the equation @xmath399 where  @xmath228 is as in . but  @xmath400 is strictly concave and its derivative vanishes at  @xmath401 . \n therefore , for  @xmath394 the solution  @xmath393 of must obey . \n let  @xmath402 be the set of  @xmath403 for which holds and note that  @xmath402 is convex . \n a standard second - derivative calculation now shows that  @xmath354 is strictly convex on  @xmath402 . \n ( here we actually differentiate the function @xmath404which is twice differentiable on the set where it is finite  and then use the known convexity of  @xmath44 . \n the strict convexity is violated on the line  @xmath401 where  @xmath389 has a flat piece for  @xmath105 $ ] . ) \n now , since  @xmath405 minimizes  @xmath354 for a given  @xmath45 , the strict convexity of  @xmath354 on  @xmath402 implies that for any  @xmath406 , @xmath407 hence ,  @xmath121 is also strictly convex . \n the fact that  @xmath408 diverges as  @xmath409 is a consequence of the corresponding property of the function  @xmath107 and the fact that the rest of  @xmath410 is convex in  @xmath45 .    as a consequence of strict convexity and the abovementioned `` steepness '' at the boundary of the interval  @xmath124 \n , the function  @xmath121 has a unique minimizer for each  @xmath119 and  @xmath142 , as long as the quantities from satisfy  @xmath411 . \n the minimizer is automatically continuous in  @xmath22 and is manifestly non - decreasing . \n furthermore , the continuity of  @xmath412 in  @xmath36 allows us to conclude that  @xmath405 is also continuous in  @xmath36 . \n what is left of the claims is the _ strict _ monotonicity of  @xmath45 as a function of  @xmath22 . \n writing  @xmath413 as  @xmath414 and noting that  @xmath415 is continuously differentiable on  @xmath124 , the minimizing  @xmath45 satisfies @xmath416 but  @xmath417 is also strictly convex and so  @xmath418 is strictly increasing . \n it follows that  @xmath45 has to be strictly increasing with  @xmath22 . \n theorem  [ thm3.1 ] has the following simple consequence that is worth highlighting :    [ cor3.6 ] for given  @xmath119 and  @xmath118 , let  @xmath419 be the minimizer of  @xmath354 . \n then for all  @xmath262 , @xmath420    proof on the basis of and the fact that  @xmath354 has a unique minimizer , a covering argument  same as used to prove implies that the probability on the left - hand side decays to zero exponentially in  @xmath238 . \n before we proceed to the proof of our second main theorem , let us make an observation concerning the values of  @xmath421 at the minimizing  @xmath45 and  @xmath115 :    [ lemma3.7 ] let  @xmath119 and  @xmath118 be fixed and let  @xmath419 be the minimizer of  @xmath354 . \n define the quantities  @xmath159 by and  @xmath422 by . \n then @xmath423 moreover ,  @xmath166 are then related to  @xmath22 via whenever  @xmath105 $ ] . \n proof first let us ascertain that  @xmath166 are well defined from equations . \n we begin by noting that the set of possible values of  @xmath424 is the unit square  @xmath425 ^ 2 $ ] . \n as is easily shown , the first equation in corresponds to an increasing curve in  @xmath425 ^ 2 $ ] connecting the corners  @xmath426 and  @xmath427 . on the other hand , \n the second equation in is a straight line with negative slope which by the fact that  @xmath428 intersects both the top and the right side of the square . \n it follows that these curves intersect at a single point  the unique solution of . \n next we will derive equations that  @xmath421 have to satisfy . \n let  @xmath419 be the unique minimizer of  @xmath354 . \n the partial derivative with respect to  @xmath115 yields @xmath429 and from the very definition of  @xmath421 we have @xmath430 noting that  @xmath431 , we now see that  @xmath421 satisfies the same equations as  @xmath166 and so , by the above uniqueness argument , must hold .    to prove relation , let us also consider the derivative of  @xmath354 with respect to  @xmath45 . for solutions in  @xmath46 $ ] \n we can disregard the  @xmath175 part of the function ( because its vanishes along with its derivative throughout this interval ) , so we have @xmath432 a straightforward calculation then yields . \n now we are ready to prove our second main result :    proof of theorem  [ thm2 ] the crucial technical step for the present proof has already been established in lemma  [ lemma3.2 ] . in order to plug into the latter result , \n let us note that the sum of  @xmath433 over all salt configurations  @xmath214 with  @xmath221 is a number depending only on the total magnetization  @xmath434 . \n lemma  [ lemma3.2 ] then implies @xmath435 where  @xmath436 is a positive number depending on  @xmath45 , the parameters  @xmath36 ,  @xmath22 ,  @xmath21 and the boundary condition  @xmath128 but not on the event  @xmath132 . noting that  @xmath129 is simply the distribution of the random variables  @xmath437 in measure  @xmath88 , this proves  .    in order to prove the assertion \n , we let  @xmath438 , pick  @xmath252 and fix  @xmath439 . \n since lemma  [ lemma3.2 ] guarantees that , given  @xmath440 , all salt configurations with fixed  @xmath218 and concentration  @xmath36 have the same probability in  @xmath219 , we have @xmath441 where  @xmath442 is defined in . pick  @xmath230 and assume , as in lemma  [ lemma3.4 ] , that  @xmath443 $ ] , @xmath444 $ ] and  @xmath445 for some  @xmath45 with  @xmath232 . then the aforementioned lemma tells us that @xmath446 is within  @xmath211 of the probability that  @xmath447 occurs in the product measure where the probability of  @xmath448 is  @xmath449 if  @xmath450 and  @xmath451 if  @xmath452 . \n let  @xmath419 be the unique minimizer of  @xmath354 . \n taking expectation of over  @xmath453 with  @xmath454 fixed , using corollary  [ cor3.6 ] to discard the events  @xmath455 or  @xmath456 and invoking the continuity of  @xmath421 in  @xmath45 and  @xmath115 , we find out that @xmath457 indeed converges to @xmath458 with  @xmath421 evaluated at the minimizing  @xmath419 . \n but for this choice lemma  [ lemma3.7 ] guarantees that @xmath459 , which finally proves ( [ 2.7][2.8 ] ) . \n the last item to be proved is proposition  [ prop2b ] establishing the basic features of the phase diagram of the model under consideration :    proof of proposition  [ prop2b ] from lemma  [ lemma3.7 ] we already know that the set of points  @xmath160 for  @xmath105 $ ] is given by the equation . by the fact that  @xmath460 is strictly increasing in  @xmath22 and that  @xmath461 as  @xmath462 we thus know that defines a line in the  @xmath143-plane . \n specializing to  @xmath463 gives us two curves parametrized by functions  @xmath464 such that at  @xmath143 satisfying  @xmath165 the system magnetization  @xmath460 is strictly between  @xmath465 and  @xmath190 , i.e. , @xmath143 is in the phase separation region .    it remains to show that the above functions  @xmath466 are strictly monotone and negative for  @xmath142 . \n we will invoke the expression which applies because on the above curves we have  @xmath467 $ ] . \n let us introduce new variables @xmath468 and , writing  @xmath22 in in terms of  @xmath469 , let us differentiate with respect to  @xmath36 . \n ( we will denote the corresponding derivatives by superscript prime . ) \n since gives us that  @xmath470 , we easily derive @xmath471 thus ,  @xmath472 and  @xmath473 have opposite signs ; i.e. , we want to prove that  @xmath474 . but \n that is immediate : by the second equation in we conclude that at least one of  @xmath475 must be strictly positive , and by  @xmath470 we find that both  @xmath476 . \n it follows that  @xmath466 are strictly decreasing , and since  @xmath477 , they are also negative once  @xmath142 . \n the

        "abstract": "This study explores the statistical mechanics of mixed systems, focusing on phase transitions and phase separation in solutions using a simplified lattice-based model. By incorporating concepts from pure systems, such as the Ising model and Gibbs measures, the work rigorously investigates phenomena like freezing-point depression and phase separation driven by salt concentration. Key findings reveal that salt suppresses the freezing temperature due to entropic effects, and phase separation occurs over a range of external field values, unlike in pure systems. The research provides insights into the interplay between magnetization, salt concentration, and external fields, with implications for understanding colligative properties in general non-volatile solutions."

        "article": "compact symmetric objects ( csos ) are a family of extragalactic radio sources comprising roughly 3% of flux - limited samples selected at high frequencies ( taylor , readhead , & pearson 1996 ; peck & taylor 2001 ) . \n their defining characteristic is the presence of high luminosity radio components on both sides of a central engine on sub - kiloparsec scales with little or no extended emission present . \n csos typically exhibit terminal hotspots which move apart at subluminal speeds ( owsianik & conway 1998 ; gugliucci et al . \n jet components en route between the core and the hot spots where they terminate , appear to move faster , and superluminal speeds in the jets are seen in a few sources ( taylor , readhead & pearson 2000 ) . \n the jets can be similar or much brighter than the counterjets . \n csos on the whole exhibit weak radio variability , have low radio polarization and low core luminosities . \n their hosts are in general elliptical galaxies ( readhead et al . \n 1996 ) though there are a few notable exceptions identified with seyferts and quasars . \n the general picture that has emerged is that csos are young radio galaxies , with ages between 100 and 10000 years . \n since they are selected on the basis of relatively unbeamed hot - spots and lobes , their orientation on the sky is random \n . orientation may still affect the presence of detectable linear polarization ( gugliucci et al . 2007 ) , or absorption from atomic gas associated with the hypothesized gas and dust torus that surrounds the central engine and is thought to be oriented perpendicular to the jet axis ( peck et al . 2000 ; pihlstrm et al . \n 2003 ) . however , as doppler boosting effects are less dominant , we have the added benefit of studying the emission from both sides of the nucleus . \n csos provide a unique opportunity to determine the hubble constant , as a direct measurement of the distance to an object can be obtained by observing angular motion in it , if the intrinsic linear velocity can be ascertained independently . basically , one has the time derivative of a standard ruler , with the additional constraint that no intrinsic motion can be faster than light . \n from five epochs of observations of the cso 1946 + 708 at 5 ghz taylor & vermeulen ( 1997 ) placed a lower limit of h@xmath4 @xmath2 37 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 . \n we explore what can be learned from continuing this analysis using more comprehensive observations . \n we also use this symmetric system , for which the geometry of the jets can be precisely determined , to probe the details of jet propagation . \n kinematic ages for the radio emission in csos can be obtained by measuring the separation speed between the hot spots over time and comparing this to the overall spatial separation ( owsianik & conway 1998 ; gugliucci et al . \n 2005 ) . at the moment \n , the cso age distribution seems to be disproportionally stacked towards younger sources . however , there are a number of selection effects that need to be addressed before the meager data collected can be properly analyzed . \n larger sources are over - resolved by vlbi observations so that measuring the expansion becomes difficult ; more slowly expanding sources require longer time baselines to obtain age estimates . in this work we present observations of the cso 1946 + 708 spanning 16 years . \n it is of considerable interest to pursue this line of research to address the evolution of radio galaxies . \n we assume @xmath1 = 71 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 and the standard cosmology so that 1= 1.835 kpc and an angular velocity of 1 mas / y = 5.98 c at the redshift ( 0.1008 ) of the radio galaxy 1946 + 708 ( peck & taylor 2001 ) . \n the observations were carried out at 8.4 ghz and 15.4 ghz over the course of eight epochs , taken on 1995 march 22 , 1996 july 07 , 1998 february 06 , 1999 july 11 , 2001 may 17 , and at 8.4 ghz only on 2003 jan 24/2003 feb 10 , 2006 feb 18 , and 2008 mar 9 ( see table 1 ) . observations in 1995 , 1998 , and 2001 were observed using all ten elements of the vlba of the nrao , and observations from 2003 on were observed using a global array including all ten elements of the vlba , and five elements from the european vlbi network ( evn ) including the 100 m telescope at effelsberg , the westerbork phased array , onsala , medicina , and in 2003 only , the telescope at noto . due to problems at the st . \n croix and north liberty stations , epochs in 1996 and 1999 were performed using nine vlba antennas each . \n problems in 2003 prevented effelsberg from participating . \n both right and left circular polarizations were recorded for the first 5 epochs , while the last three where observed only in right circular polarization . \n all epochs employed 2 bit sampling across if bandwidths of 8 mhz . \n the vlba correlator produced 16 frequency channels across each if during every 2 s integration . \n we also include in our analysis the 5 ghz observations acquired between 1992 and 1995 by taylor & vermeulen ( 1997 ) , some of which are contemporaneous with the 8.4 and 15 ghz observations reported here . \n parallactic angle effects resulting from the altitude - azimuth antenna mounts were removed using the aips task clcor . \n amplitude calibration for each antenna was derived from measurements of antenna gain and system temperatures during each run . \n delays between the stations clocks were determined using the aips task fring ( schwab & cotton 1983 ) . \n calibration was applied by splitting the multi - source data set immediately prior to preliminary editing , imaging , deconvolution and self - calibration in difmap ( shepherd , pearson , & taylor 1994 , 1995 ) . \n multiple iterations of phase self - calibration and imaging were applied to each source before any attempt at amplitude self - calibration was made . \n the preliminary models developed in difmap were subsequently applied in aips to make phase corrections , to determine the leakage terms between the rcp and lcp feeds and to correct for residual phase differences between polarizations . final imaging and self - calibration were performed in difmap . \n model fitting of gaussian components to the self - calibrated visibility data was also performed in difmap . \n the shapes of the components were fixed after fitting to the 1995 epoch ; in the rest of the epochs each component was allowed only to move and to vary in flux density in order to fit the independently self - calibrated visibility data . \n each frequency band ( 5 , 8.4 and 15.4 ghz ) was modelfit independently in order to allow for differences in component shapes between frequencies . for our last three epochs from 2003 to 2008 , all global 8.4 ghz observations , an additional pair of components had to be fit on either side of the core ( see  4.1 ) . \n uncertainties in the sizes and positions for components were derived from signal - to - noise ratios and component sizes ( fomalont 1999 ) . \n this assumes that parameters are not covariant , which should be the case for the strong , well - separated components that we present in this analysis of 1946 + 708 . \n while one of the first objects to be confirmed as a bona - fide compact symmetric object , 1946 + 708 is in a few ways unusual for this class . \n the source is remarkably `` rotation '' symmetric ( see figures 1 and 2 ) . \n narrow , well collimated jets emerge from a compact , flat spectrum core and bend gradually before terminating in well defined hot spots . \n faint `` lobes '' of emission are evident at 90  angles to the jets \n . distinct components in the jet are seen to move out from the core to the hot spots on both the northern ( jet ) side and the southern ( counter - jet ) side . \n our most uniform , sensitive , and highest resolution sequence of images is that at 8.4 ghz . \n the 8.4 ghz images cover the period from march 1995 to march 2008 , and have noise levels ranging from 163 @xmath5jy / beam down to 38 @xmath5jy / beam ( table 1 ) . \n no polarized flux has been detected from 1946 + 708 at either 8.4 or 15.4 ghz in any epoch . \n typical 2@xmath6 limits on the linearly polarized flux density are @xmath7100 @xmath5jy at 8.4 ghz and @xmath7170 @xmath5jy at 15.4 ghz . \n this source is quite steady in the production of strong and distinct jet components . \n in addition to the previously studied pairs n2/s2 and n5/s5 , we report here on the discovery of a new set of components which we name n6/s6 ( fig .  2 ) . \n like the previous sets , these new components appear to have been launched simultaneously as a pair , and appear to be moving away from the core in opposite directions . \n the angular separation between the new pair ( n6 and s6 ) observed in our 2008 epoch is 1.288 mas . the apparent proper motion between n6 and s6 and the core is difficult to determine owing to possible blending of these components with the core , but \n the total separation can be compared with the 2006 epoch in which it was 1.045 mas . \n the total apparent expansion speed between the pair over the past two years is thus 0.238 mas / y or 0.72 c. this puts the ejection age for the new pair at 1997.3 . \n indeed evidence of the new component set can be seen in the 2003 epoch , and to a lesser extent in 2001 . \n the sum of the core flux density and the flux density of the new components n6 and s6 during this period ( fig . \n 3 ) was rising steadily , and only seems to be declining later on , as the new components move well away from the core .      in fig . \n 4 we plot the positions of the 4 strongest jet components ( n2 , n5 , s5 and s2 ) derived from modelfitting elliptical gaussians to the visibility data at 8.4 ghz . \n the well - tracked jet components close to the core , n5 and s5 , appear to move out with the highest apparent velocity ( table 2 and fig .  5 ; and see also the moviegbtaylor/ ] ) , with n5 being the fastest at an apparent velocity of 1.088 c , and s5 being about one third that in very nearly the opposite direction . \n note that these are apparent velocities projected in the plane of the sky , as opposed to intrinsic , three - dimensional velocities . \n the more distant pair of components ( n2/s2 ) appear to be moving at roughly half the apparent velocity of the inner ( n5/s5 ) pair . from this fact \n one might be tempted to assert that the jet starts out fast and decelerates with time . \n if this was the case , and the deceleration is uniform , then we would expect to see the n5/s5 pair slowing down , but this is not observed . even after 12 years of monitoring and a distance covered corresponding to 10% of the length of the jet , there is no compelling evidence for slowing of any of the components . \n the @xmath8 values indicate reasonably good fits to a straight line for all components ( the @xmath8 values may be systematically better in declination than in right ascension owing to the north - south orientation of most of the components ) . \n if current velocities remain unchanged then the n5/s5 pair will catch up with the n2/s2 pair in @xmath075 years , close to the time that they enter the hot spots . \n alternatively , it could be that there is a sudden deceleration of the jet components at a distance from the core between 3.5 and 9 mas ( on the northern side ) . \n this gap is defined by the minimum distance of 9 mas for n2 in 1995 and the maximum distance for n5 observed in 2008 . \n this is in the region where the jet bends the most ( @xmath9 ) towards the northern hot spot , so a deceleration region should not be ruled out prematurely . \n considering the newest pair of components , n6/s6 , their total apparent separation speed is 0.72c , more like that of the n2/s2 pair ( 0.63 c ) , than the n5/s5 pair ( 1.4 c ) . \n observations over the next @xmath05 years should settle the issue of whether components emerge with their own , intrinsic set of velocities , or if they partake in some fixed pattern of acceleration and deceleration . \n if there is a fixed , repeating pattern , then it might be possible to relate it to a helical jet model . in a helical model , \n the intrinsic velocity could be constant while the orientation changes in time to produce the observed variations in the projected apparent velocities . \n such a model naturally reproduces the rotational symmetry of 1946 + 708 and has been found to explain observations over many years of the galactic jet in ss433 ( roberts et al . \n 2008 , hjellming & johnston 1981 ) . \n the path of the inner jet components of 1946 + 708 ( n5 and s5 ) both appear fairly straight to within the errors in the measurements . \n there is a suggestion of a bend in the trajectory of n5 after the 2006 epoch ( epoch 9 in fig .  4 ) , but this relies almost entirely on the position at the 2008 epoch . for the more distant northern component ( n2 ) \n there are kinks in the apparent motion near epochs 1994 , 2001 and 2006 ( epochs 2 , 7 and 9 in fig .  4 ) . \n there also appears to be an offset in the 15 ghz positions ( see fig . \n this suggests a flatter spectrum on the eastern side of this component . \n a similar offset is suggested by the multi - frequency trajectory plot of s2 based on the 5 and 8 ghz observations , but since the motions are smaller and the component is weaker it is difficult to be sure if the spectral gradient is real . \n a kink is observed in component s2 near the 2003 epoch ( epoch 8 in fig . \n 4 ) .    in \n well studied core - jet sources , such as 3c345 ( zensus et al . \n 1995 , unwin et al . \n 1997 ) , jet components are found to travel along curved trajectories and to change their speeds . \n this acceleration has been taken as justification for magnetically driven jets , as opposed to purely hydrodynamical structures ( vlakhis & konigl 2004 ) . by analogy with these core - jet sources , \n we draw a similar conclusion that the jets of 1946 + 708 are likely to be magnetically driven . \n note , however , that intrinsic velocities of jet components in core - jet agns are typically in the range @xmath10 , considerably larger than we observe in the cso 1946 + 708 of 1.3 @xmath11 2.3 ( see below ) .    even before the core of 1946 \n + 708 was identified based on 15 ghz observations , the first two epochs at 5 ghz suggested its location by exhibiting bi - directional motions away from the center of the source . \n given these motions and the symmetry of the source ( figs .  1 and 2 ) \n , it is reasonable to assert that n5 and s5 were ejected at the same time , and likewise n2 and s2 . \n indeed , we are fortunate enough to witness the ejection of n6 and s6 in @xmath01997 as discussed above . \n sensitive observations at 8.4 ghz ( see fig . \n 2 ) , reveal that there is continuous emission from the core out to both hot spots . \n the jet is probably not made up of discrete blobs that can be well described by the elliptical gaussian components that we identify and modelfit . \n rather the jet appears to be a continuous flow , with features of enhanced emission ( shocks ? ) that propagate down the jet .    under the assumption that components are ejected in pairs , and that all differences are due to doppler boosting and light travel time effects , we can use the observed apparent velocity ratios and differences to solve for the intrinsic component velocity and orientation . \n for simultaneously ejected components moving in opposite directions at an angle @xmath12 to the line of sight at an intrinsic velocity @xmath13 , it follows directly from the light travel time difference that the ratio of apparent projected distances from the origin ( @xmath14 for the approaching side , @xmath15 for the receding side ) as well as the ratio of apparent motions ( approaching : @xmath16 , receding : @xmath17 ) is given at any time by ( taylor & vermeulen 1997 ) : @xmath18    our other important constraint on the two parameters @xmath13 and @xmath12 can be obtained from the separation rate @xmath19 , is not subject to the uncertainty in the reference point . from geometry and the conversion of angular to linear velocity we have : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the projected separation velocity , @xmath22 is the angular size distance to the source , and @xmath23 is the redshift . \n note that eq . \n 2 has a distance dependence , while eq . \n 1 does not , so we can solve the system jointly for the distance and hence the hubble constant .    for the n5/s5 pair \n we find an apparent velocity ratio @xmath24 of 3.50 @xmath25 0.44 . \n this leads to @xmath26 = 0.56 @xmath25 0.04 . at the same time \n , the apparent separation speed of the n5/s5 pair is 1.40 @xmath25 0.01 c. the two relations above are shown graphically in fig . \n 6 ( bottom panel ) . assuming a standard cosmology and h@xmath4 = 71 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 we find a common solution for an intrinsic velocity of 0.88 @xmath25 0.03 c , at an inclination of 50 @xmath25 5 . \n a similar analysis for the n2/s2 pair ( top panel of fig . \n 6 ) , yields in intrinsic velocity of 0.57 @xmath25 0.11 c and with an inclination of 36 @xmath25 10 . \n the intrinsic velocity therefore changes from 0.9 c for n5/s5 to 0.6 c for n2/s2 ( a change of 2.7 @xmath6 ) . \n there is no single intrinsic velocity that can fit the observations for both pairs , and can be used to directly measure the hubble constant . \n we can , however , place a lower limit on the hubble constant based on the fact that the intrinsic velocity must be less than the speed of light . \n we find that h@xmath4 @xmath2 57 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 in order to achieve a valid solution for the n5/s5 pair , and the weaker constraint that h@xmath4 @xmath2 28 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 in order to achieve a valid solution for the n2/s2 pair . \n since the velocities of n2/s2 differ from those of n5/s5 anyway , we see no reason why the latter should be particularly close to c , so for the rest of this discussion we adopt h@xmath4 = 71 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 . \n the solutions discussed above using equations 1 and 2 are based on assuming that the components in a pair , as observed , are oppositely directed and equally fast . \n we derive angles near 45 ; the line of sight depth difference between the components in a pair would therefore be an appreciable fraction of their total distance along the connecting line through the core , and roughly equal to the distance projected onto the plane of the sky . \n we derive component speeds that are an appreciable fraction of the speed of light . in combination , the speed and angle solutions imply that the receding component , due to a significant light travel time difference , should be observed at a rather younger age ( 25%-75% ) than its approaching counterpart , and at a correspondingly smaller projected distance from the core \n . however , the observed arm length ratios ( @xmath27 ) are lower by a factor of about 2 compared to the apparent velocity ratios ( 1.33 vs.  2.76 for n2/s2 ; and 1.80 vs.3.50 for n5/s5 ) . \n this requires that currently the light travel time differences between the approaching and receding components are less significant with respect to the ages of the components than our simple speed and angle solutions suggest . \n the arm length ratios depend on the entire history of motion of the components , and the greater degree of symmetry in arm lengths seems to imply that for a significant part of their lifetime the components were slower and/or moving more along the plane of the sky than they are now . a fully self - consistent solution therefore will incorporate a model for the true core location and for this evolution in velocity , since , inevitably , it implies that the receding component is seen at a younger age and therefore with a different velocity than its counterpart . \n this leads to an extension of equations 1 and 2 , into a set where the arm length ratio is directly incorporated ; helical jet models may provide a framework for this extension . \n however , it is beyond the scope of this paper . to properly verify such a model in the case of 1946 + 708 will require observations spanning several decades . \n nevertheless , we believe the velocities we have derived , while not fully self - consistent , are indicative of the fact that the jets of this source contain features that move with speeds that are an appreciable fraction of the speed of light , and certainly much faster than the advance speeds of the hot spots . \n furthermore , the differences in angle ( by at least 15 degrees ) as well as in speed ( by at least 50% ) between the n2/s2 and n5/s5 pairs are good indications of the kinds of changes in component velocity that are evidently occurring in and along the jets . \n both the discrepant arm length ratios and the observed bending in projection of the overall jets on the plane of the sky provide interesting constraints . \n the time evolution of the flux densities of the n2/s2 and n5/s5 pair is shown in fig . \n the n2 component has shown a steady rise by @xmath020% over 13 years of monitoring at 8.4 ghz . during that same time s2 \n has only slightly decreased . \n meanwhile both n5 and s5 have been declining though that appears to have leveled off starting in 2006 . \n the amount of the decline was 75% for n5 and 57% for s5 . \n we are currently in the unbalanced situation where s5 appears to be brighter than n5 , which would at first sight seem contrary to the expectations from doppler boosting . \n however , we have to keep in mind that the light from s5 is delayed compared to the light that we see from n5 ( by 27 years for the 2008 epoch according to the geometry derived above ) so that the history of variability must be taken into account when attempting to interpret flux density ratios between component pairs . \n a more detailed analysis of the flux density ratios , taking into account the time variability , should eventually be possible . \n even so , it may not be possible to explain the very significant changes in flux density shown in fig .  7 . given the stability of the component velocities ( see fig .  5 ) . \n local circumstances ( e.g. , variations in magnetic field strength or particle populations ) , and possible interactions of the jet components with their environments , may influence the synchrotron emissivity of the jet components . \n the curvature in the jets of 1946 + 708 ( fig . \n 1 ) could be explained by either ( 1 ) ballistic motion from a precessing nucleus ; or ( 2 ) helical confinement of the components . in the first case \n we would expect components to travel in straight lines at constant apparent velocities . in the latter case \n we would expect that components might travel along helical trajectories at apparent velocities that changed in time . \n although there is no strong evidence yet for deviations from constant apparent velocities , there do appear to be some wiggles or kinks in the jets , and in particular if one considers also the earliest 5 ghz measurement ( c1 in fig . \n 4 ) , then there appears to have been a change in direction of several degrees . \n this favors the second explanation of a helically confined jet . \n likewise , the presence of continuous emission along the jet , well confined , even if traveling at different intrinsic velocities ( n5 vs n2 ) , supports the notional model of an intrinsically helical jet .      from the modelfit analysis it is difficult to ascertain the expansion of the source . \n certainly it is clear that the motion is much slower than the jet components . \n unfortunately the southern hot spot is fairly faint and diffuse , so is correspondingly less amenable to modelfitting than the compact jet components . \n the northern hot spot does have a bright and compact feature , and one can measure with considerable accuracy its position relative to the core . the observed motion is @xmath70.01 mas / y , at the level that one has to be concerned about possible motions of the core component due to the ejection of the n6/s6 pair . \n since the modelfit results are referenced to the core component , any apparent proper motion of the core translates into the addition of a systematic apparent velocity to all components . \n an alternative approach is to compute a difference map between two images , well separated in time . \n apparent motions then show up as alternating positive and negative structures . \n 8 shows such an image constructed by differencing the images from the 1996 and 2008 epochs - both of which are of very high quality and low noise , and were convolved with the same restoring beam . \n lighter regions in fig . \n 8 indicate where the source was brighter in 2008 . in fig . \n 8 one can see a relatively clear signature of motion away from the core of the southern hot spot , which appears as a positive ( dark ) structure ( closer to the core ) and a negative ( whiter ) structure ( further from the core ) in the difference image . \n the more rapidly moving jet components show similar structures . from measuring the advance of the edge of the southern hot spot we estimate this apparent motion to be 0.008 @xmath25 0.002 mas / y . \n since the apparent motion measured is relative to the northern hot spot , this is the overall apparent expansion rate of the source , and the apparent motion of the southern hot spot would presumably be half this value , or 0.004 mas / y , corresponding to a projected intrinsic velocity of 0.024 c ( 7000 km / s ) . \n based on the measurement of the overall expansion rate , we can derive a kinematic age for 1946 + 708 assuming a constant expansion rate . the velocity measurement derived above yields a kinematic age of 4000 @xmath25 1000 years . \n this is on the long end of cso ages measured to date ( gugliucci et al . 2005 ) , which have been measured between 100 and 3000 years , though the statistics are admittedly still poor . \n furthermore , there is a selection effect that slow expansions take longer to measure . \n the ratio of 15:1 for the northern to southern hot spot flux densities ( derived from modelfitting ) , is difficult to explain in terms of doppler boosting given the very low apparent velocities measured for the hot spots . \n a more likely explanation is that the interstellar medium may be enhanced on the northern side , consistent with the observation of greater hi opacity to the north ( peck & taylor 2001 ) . the arm length ratio between northern and southern hot spots is close to parity , 0.94:1 , with the northern hot spot being a little closer to the core . in the case of \n doppler boosting we would expect the northern hot spot to be further away from the core , thus we favor a denser medium on the northern side to be responsible for the difference in flux densities and arm length ratios between the two hot spots . \n the low observed polarization ( less than 0.4% for the core , less than @xmath00.3% for the jet components , and less than 0.1% for the northern hot spot at 8.4 ghz in 1996 ) , can be explained by faraday depolarization due to ionized gas and a magnetic field tangled on scales smaller than the angular resolution of the observations . \n this situation could naturally arise due to magnetic fields and free electrons associated with the accretion disk . \n detection of polarization has only been found in a few csos to date ( gugliucci et al . \n those few incidents of detected polarization occur in the approaching jets of csos which are more asymmetric and core - dominated than typical csos , probably indicating a smaller angle to the line - of - sight , and therefore a more shallow faraday screen . \n after a detailed , multi - frequency , multi - epoch study of the compact symmetric object 1946 + 708 , we find the kinematic age of the extant radio emission to be @xmath04000 years . on timescales of @xmath010 years , \n outbursts occur producing symmetric components that emerge from the core and travel at intrinsic speeds between 0.6 and 0.9 c towards the hot spots . \n some of the individual jet components are observed to move along slightly bent , or kinked paths , but no components have yet been observed to change their speed . \n the jet components in general appear to be well confined , and to lie within the overall `` s - symmetric '' shape of the jets . \n we suggest that the jets are helically confined , rather than ballistic in nature . \n no linear polarization from the jets or hot - spots is detected down to quite low levels ( 0.1 to 0.4% ) , consistent with observations of csos in general . \n future observations over the next decade should allow for a detailed analysis of the newly ejected component pair n6/s6 . \n together with continued observations of n2/s2 and n5/s5 it should be possible to measure accelerations in the jet components , and to tell if each component pair has an intrinsic velocity that is established upon ejection . a more sophisticated analysis , taking into account the flux history of the jet components , \n could provide a more stringent test of doppler boosting in 1946 + 708 and thereby ascertain the extent to which interactions with the environment are important . \n we thank h. smith for help with the data

        "abstract": "Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) like 1946+708 are a rare class of extragalactic radio sources exhibiting high luminosity on sub-kiloparsec scales with minimal extended emission. Observations over 16 years reveal symmetric jets with components moving at velocities up to 0.9c. CSOs are likely young radio galaxies with kinematic ages around 4,000 years. Their jets, which may exhibit helical confinement, provide insights into intrinsic velocities, environmental interactions, and the evolution of radio galaxies. These studies also contribute to estimating the Hubble constant by measuring jet separations and intrinsic velocities. Future observations promise further understanding of jet dynamics and polarization properties."

        "article": "in @xcite the problem of how to give an explicit combinatorial definition of weak higher categories was solved , and the development of a conceptual framework for their further analysis was begun . in the aftermath of this , the expository work of other authors , most notably street @xcite and leinster @xcite , contributed greatly to our understanding of these ideas . \n the central idea of @xcite is that the description of any @xmath0-dimensional categorical structure @xmath2 , may begin by starting with just the underlying @xmath0-globular set , that is , the sets and functions @xmath3^{t }   \\ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s } & { x_2 } \\ar@<1ex>[l]^{t }   \\ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s } & { x_3 } \\ar@<1ex>[l]^{t }   \\ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s } & { ... } \\ar@<1ex>[l]^{t }   \\ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s } & { x_n } \\ar@<1ex>[l]^{t }   \\ar@<-1ex>[l]_{s}}\\ ] ] satisfying the equations @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which embody the the objects ( elements of @xmath6 ) , arrows ( elements of @xmath7 ) and higher cells of the structure in question . at this stage \n no compositions have been defined , and when they are , one has a globular set with extra structure . in this way \n the problem of defining an n - categorical structure of a given type is that of defining the monad on the category @xmath8 of @xmath0-globular sets whose algebras are these structures . \n as explained in the introduction to @xcite , this approach works because the monads concerned have excellent formal properties , which facilitate their explicit description and further analysis . \n the @xmath0-operads of @xcite can be defined from the point of view of monads : one has the monad @xmath9 on @xmath8 whose algebras are strict @xmath0-categories , and an @xmath0-operad consists of another monad @xmath1 on @xmath8 equipped with a cartesian monad morphism @xmath10 . \n the algebras of this @xmath0-operad are just the algebras of @xmath1 . \n strict @xmath0-categories are easily defined by iterated enrichment : a strict @xmath11-category is a category enriched in the category of strict @xmath0-categories via its cartesian product , but are too strict for the intended applications in homotopy theory and geometry . for @xmath12 the strictest structure one can replace an arbitrary weak @xmath13-category with  and not lose vital information  is a gray category , which is a category enriched in @xmath14 using the gray tensor product of 2-categories instead of its cartesian product @xcite . \n this experience leads naturally to the idea of trying to define what the higher dimensional analogues of the gray tensor product are , so as to set up a similar inductive definition as for strict @xmath0-categories , but to capture the appropriate semi - strict @xmath0-categories , which in the appropriate sense , would form the strictest structure one can replace an arbitrary weak @xmath0-category with and not lose vital information . \n crans in @xcite attempted to realise this idea in dimension 4 , and one of our main motivations is to obtain a theory that will deliver the sort of tensor product that crans was trying to define explicitly , but in a conceptual way that one could hope to generalise to still higher dimensions . \n our examples([ex : gray ] ) and ( [ ex : crans ] ) embody the progress that we have achieved in this direction in this paper . in @xcite the theory of the present paper \n is used to show that the _ funny tensor product _ of categories  which is what one obtains by considering the gray tensor product of @xmath15-categories but ignoring what happens to 2-cells  generalises to give an analogous symmetric monoidal closed structure on the category of algebras of any higher operad . from these developments \n it seems that a conceptual understanding of the higher dimensional analogues of the gray tensor product is within reach . \n fundamentally , we have two kinds of combinatorial objects important for the description and study of higher categorical structures \n @xmath0-operads and tensor products . in @xcite \n a description of the relationship between tensor products and @xmath0-operads was begun , and @xmath11-operads whose algebras involve no structure at the level objects were canonically related with certain lax tensor products on @xmath8 . under this correspondence the algebras of the @xmath11-operad coincide with categories enriched in the associated lax tensor product . \n sections([sec : eg - lmc])-([sec:2-functoriality ] ) of the present paper continue this development by studying , for a given category @xmath16 , the passage @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the category of graphs enriched in @xmath16 , in a systematic way . \n this analysis culminates in section([sec:2-functoriality ] ) where the above assignment is seen as the object part of a 2-functor @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a sub 2-category of the 2-category of lax monoidal categories , and @xmath21 is as defined by the formal theory of monads @xcite . \n from this perspective , one is able to describe in a more efficient and general way , many of the previous developments of higher category theory in the globular style . \n for instance , in section([ssec : induction ] ) we give a short and direct explicit construction of the monads @xmath9 for strict @xmath0-categories from which all their key properties are easily witnessed . in sections([ssec : general - op - mult ] ) and ( [ ssec : induction ] ) we give shorter and more general proofs of some of the main results of @xcite . in section([ssec : monmonad - distlaw ] ) using a dual version of our 2-functor @xmath22 and the formal theory of monads @xcite , we obtain a satisfying general explanation for how it is that monad distributive laws arise in higher category theory \n see @xcite @xcite . in sections([ssec \n : tci ] ) and ( [ ssec : tcii ] ) we apply our theory to simplifying many aspects of @xcite .    the correspondence between @xmath11-operads and certain lax monoidal structures on @xmath8 given in @xcite , associates to the 3-operad @xmath23 for gray categories , a lax tensor product on the category of 2-globular sets . \n however the gray tensor product itself is a tensor product of 2-categories . \n any lax monoidal structure on a category @xmath16 comes with a `` unary '' tensor product , which rather than being trivial as is the usual experience with non - lax tensor products , is in fact a monad on @xmath16 . for the lax tensor product induced by @xmath23 , \n this is the monad for 2-categories . in section([sec : lift - mult ] ) we solve the general problem of lifting a lax monoidal structure , to a tensor product on the category of algebras of the monad defined by its unary part . \n this result , theorem([thm : lift - mult ] ) , is the main result of the paper , and provides also the sense in which these lifted tensor products are unique . in practical terms \n this means that in order to exhibit a given tensor product on some category of higher dimensional structures as arising from our machinery , it suffices to exhibit an operad whose algebras are categories enriched in that tensor product . in this way , one is able see that the usual gray tensor product and that of crans , do so arise \n .    moreover applying this lifting to the lax tensor products on @xmath8 associated to general @xmath11-operads ( over @xmath24 ) , one exhibits the structures definable by @xmath11-operads as enriched categories whose homs are some @xmath0-dimensional structure . in this way \n the globular approach is more closely related to some of the inductive approaches to higher category theory , such as that of tamsamani @xcite .    in section([ssec : \n a - infinity ] ) we describe two applications of the lifting theorem . in theorem([thm : a - infinity - app ] ) we construct a tensor product of @xmath25-algebras . as explained in @xcite \n the problem of providing such a tensor product is of relevance to string theory , and it proved resistant because of the negative result @xcite which shows that no `` genuine '' tensor product can exist . \n however this result does not rule out the existence of a _ lax _ tensor product , which is what we were able to provide in theorem([thm : a - infinity - app ] ) . \n it is possible to see the identification by joyal and street @xcite , of braided monoidal categories as monoidal categories with a multiplication as an instance of theorem([thm : a - infinity - app ] ) . \n another instance is our second application given in corollary([cor : coh - bm2c ] ) , namely an analogous result to that of joyal and street but for braided monoidal 2-categories . \n a weak @xmath0-category is an algebra of a _ \n contractible _ @xmath0-operad . in section([sec : contractibility ] ) we recall this notion , give an analogous notion of contractible lax monoidal structure and explain the canonical relationship between them .    in this paper we operate at a more abstract level than in much of the previous work on this subject . in particular , instead of studying monads on the category of @xmath0-globular sets , or even on presheaf categories , we work with monads defined on some category @xmath18 of enriched graphs . as our work shows , the main results and notions of higher category theory in the globular style can be given in this setting . \n so one could from the very beginning start not with @xmath24 as the category of @xmath26-categories , but with a nice enough @xmath16 . \n for all the constructions to go through , such as that of @xmath9 , the correspondence between monads and lax tensor products , their lifting theorem , as well as the very definition of weak @xmath0-category , it suffices to take @xmath16 to be a locally c - presentable category in the sense defined in section([ssec : lcpres ] ) .    proceeding this way one obtains then the theory of @xmath0-dimensional structures enriched in @xmath16 . \n that is to say , the object of @xmath0-cells between any two @xmath27-cells of such a structure would be an object of @xmath16 rather than a mere set . \n some alternative choices of @xmath16 which could perhaps be of interest are : ( 1 ) the ordinal @xmath28=\\{0<1\\}$ ] ( for the theory of locally ordered higher dimensional structures ) , ( 2 ) simplicial sets ( to obtain a theory of higher dimensional structures which come together with a simplicial enrichment at the highest level ) , ( 3 ) the category of sheaves on a locally connected space , or more generally a locally connected grothendieck topos , ( 4 ) the algebras of any @xmath0-operad or ( 5 ) the category of multicategories ( symmetric or not ) . the point is , the theory as we have developed it is actually _ simpler _ than before , and the generalisations mentioned here come at _ no _ extra cost . \n given a topological space @xmath2 and points @xmath29 and @xmath30 therein , one may define the topological space @xmath31 of paths in @xmath2 from @xmath29 to @xmath30 at a high degree of generality . in recalling the details \n let us denote by @xmath32 a category of `` spaces '' which is complete , cocomplete and cartesian closed . \n we shall write @xmath33 for the terminal object . \n we shall furthermore assume that @xmath32 comes equipped with a bipointed object @xmath34 playing the role of the interval . \n a conventional choice for @xmath32 is the category of compactly generated hausdorff spaces with its usual interval , although there are many other alternatives which would do just as well from the point of view of homotopy theory . \n let us denote by @xmath35 the reduced suspension of @xmath2 , which can be defined as the pushout @xmath36 { i{\\times}x}=\"tr \" [ d ] { \\sigma{x}.}=\"br \" [ l ] { 1{+}1}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tr\":\"br\",:\"bl\":\"br \" ) \" br \" [ u(.3)l(.3 ) ] ( : @{-}[r(.15)],:@{-}[d(.15)])}\\ ] ] writing @xmath37 for the category of bipointed spaces , that is to say the coslice @xmath38 , the above definition exhibits the reduced suspension construction as a functor @xmath39 in a sense this functor is the mother of homotopy theory  applying it successively to the inclusion of the empty space into the point , one obtains the inclusions of the @xmath27-sphere into the @xmath0-disk for all @xmath40 , and its right adjoint @xmath41 is the functor which sends the bipointed space @xmath42 , to the space @xmath31 of paths in @xmath2 from @xmath29 to @xmath30 . \n this adjunction @xmath43 is easy to verify directly using the above elementary definition of @xmath44 as a pushout , and the pullback square @xmath45 { x^i}=\"tr \" [ d ] { x^{1{+}1}}=\"br \" [ l ] { 1}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tr\":\"br\"^{x^i},:\"bl\":\"br\"_-{(a , b ) } ) \" tl \" [ d(.3)r(.3 ) ] ( : @{-}[l(.15)],:@{-}[u(.15)])}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the inclusion of the boundary of @xmath34 . \n the collection of spaces @xmath31 is our first example of an enriched graph in the sense of    [ def : enriched - graph ] let @xmath16 be a category . \n graph @xmath2 enriched in @xmath16 _ consists of an underlying set @xmath6 whose elements are called _ objects _ , together with an object @xmath31 of @xmath16 for each ordered pair @xmath47 of objects of @xmath2 . \n the object @xmath31 will sometimes be called the _ hom _ from @xmath29 to @xmath30 . \n a morphism @xmath48 of @xmath16-enriched graphs consists of a function @xmath49 together with a morphism @xmath50 for each @xmath47 . \n the category of @xmath16-graphs and their morphisms is denoted as @xmath18 , and we denote by @xmath51 the obvious 2-functor @xmath52 with object map as indicated .    the 2-functor @xmath51 is the mother of higher category theory in the globular style  applying it successively to the inclusion of the empty category into the point ( ie the terminal category ) , \n one obtains the inclusion of the category of @xmath27-globular sets into the category of @xmath0-globular sets . in the case \n @xmath53 this is the inclusion with object map @xmath54 { ... } = \" m \" [ r ] { x_{n{-}1}}=\"r \" \" r\":@<1ex>\"m\":@<1ex>\"l \" \" r\":@<-1ex>\"m\":@<-1ex>\"l \" } } & \\mapsto & { \\xygraph{{x_0}=\"l \" [ r ] { ... } = \" m \" [ r ] { x_{n{-}1}}=\"r \" [ r ] { \\emptyset}=\"rr \" \" rr\":@<1ex>\"r\":@<1ex>\"m\":@<1ex>\"l \" \" rr\":@<-1ex>\"r\":@<-1ex>\"m\":@<-1ex>\"l \" } } \\end{array}\\ ] ] and when @xmath55 this is the functor @xmath56 which picks out the empty set . \n thus there is exactly one @xmath57-globular set which may be identified with the empty set . \n it is often better to think of @xmath51 as taking values in @xmath58 . by applying the endofunctor @xmath51 to the unique functor @xmath59 for each @xmath16 , \n produces the forgetful functor @xmath60 which sends an enriched graph to its underlying set of objects . \n this manifestation @xmath61 has a left adjoint which we shall denote as @xmath62 for reasons that are about to become clear . \n the functor @xmath62 is a variation of the grothendieck construction . to a given functor \n @xmath63 it associates the category @xmath64 with objects triples @xmath65 where @xmath29 is an object of @xmath1 , and @xmath66 is an ordered pair of objects of @xmath67 . \n maps are just maps in @xmath1 which preserve these base points in the obvious sense . \n it is interesting to look at the unit and counit of this 2-adjunction . given a category @xmath16 , @xmath68 is the category of bipointed enriched graphs in @xmath16 . \n the counit @xmath69 sends @xmath42 to the hom @xmath31 . \n when @xmath16 has an initial object @xmath70 has a left adjoint given by @xmath71 . \n given a functor @xmath63 the unit @xmath72 sends @xmath73 to the enriched graph whose objects are elements of @xmath67 , and the hom @xmath74 is given by the bipointed object @xmath65 . \n consider the case where @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the representable @xmath77 \n . then @xmath64 may be regarded as the category of endo - cospans of the object @xmath26 , that is to say the category of diagrams @xmath78 and a point of @xmath73 is now just a map @xmath79 . \n when @xmath1 is also cocomplete one can compute a left adjoint to @xmath80 . to do this note that a graph @xmath2 enriched in @xmath64 gives rise to a functor @xmath81 where @xmath6 is the set of objects of @xmath2 . \n for any set @xmath82 , @xmath83 is defined as the following category . \n it has two kinds of objects : an object being either an element of @xmath82 , or an ordered pair of elements of @xmath82 . \n there are two kinds of non - identity maps @xmath84 where @xmath66 is an ordered pair from @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is free on the graph just described . a more conceptual way to see \n this category is as the category of elements of the graph @xmath85 { z}=\"r \" \" l\":@<1ex>\"r \" \" l\":@<-1ex>\"r\"}\\ ] ] where the source and target maps are the product projections , as a presheaf on the category @xmath86 { = } [ r(1.25 ) ] { \\xybox{\\xygraph{0 [ r ] 1 \" 0\":@<1ex>\"1\":@<1ex>@{<-}\"0 \" } } } * \\frm{-}}\\ ] ] and so there is a discrete fibration @xmath87 . \n the functor @xmath88 sends singletons to @xmath75 , and a pair @xmath66 to the head of the hom @xmath89 . \n the arrow map of @xmath88 encodes the bipointings of the homs . \n one may then easily verify    let @xmath75 , @xmath77 and @xmath1 be cocomplete . \n then @xmath90 has left adjoint given on objects by @xmath91 .    in the exposition \n thus far we have focussed on building an analogy between the reduced suspension of a space and the graphs enriched in a category . \n now we shall bring these constructions together . \n as we have seen already to each space @xmath2 one can associate a canonical topologically enriched graph whose homs are the path spaces of @xmath2 . denoting this enriched graph as @xmath92 , \n the assignment @xmath93 is the object map of the composite right adjoint in @xmath94 { \\ca g(\\top_{\\bullet})}=\"m \" [ r ] { \\ca g\\top}=\"r \" \" l\":@<-1.5ex>\"m\"_-{\\eta}|{}=\"b1\":@<-1.5ex>\"l\"|{}=\"t1 \" \" t1\":@{}\"b1\"|{\\perp } \" m\":@<-1.5ex>\"r\"_-{\\ca gh}|{}=\"b2\":@<-1.5ex>\"m\"_-{\\ca g\\sigma}|{}=\"t2 \" \" t2\":@{}\"b2\"|{\\perp}}.\\ ] ] as explained by cheng @xcite , this functor @xmath95 is a key ingredient of the trimble definition of weak @xmath0-category . \n the important properties of @xmath51 are apparent because of the close connection between @xmath51 and the @xmath96 construction . \n a very mild reformulation of the notion of @xmath16-graph is the following : a @xmath16-graph @xmath2 consists of a set @xmath6 together with an @xmath97-indexed family of objects of @xmath16 . \n together with the analogous reformulation of the maps of @xmath18 , this means that we have a pullback square @xmath98_{(-)_0=\\ca gt_v } \\save \\pos?(.3)=\"lpb \" \\restore \\ar[r]^- { } \\save \\pos?(.3)=\"tpb \" \\restore & { \\fam{v } } \\ar[d]^{\\fam(t_v ) } \\save \\pos?(.3)=\"rpb \" \\restore \\\\ { \\set } \\ar[r]_-{(-)^2 } \\save \\pos?(.3)=\"bpb \" \\restore & { \\set } \\pos \" rpb \" ; \" lpb \" * * @ { } ; ? ! \n { \" bpb\";\"tpb\"}=\"cpb \" * * @ { } ; ? * * @{- } ; \" tpb \" ; \" cpb \" * * @ { } ; ? * * @{-}}}\\ ] ] in @xmath99 , and thus a cartesian 2-natural transformation @xmath100 . from @xcite theorem(7.4 ) \n we conclude    [ prop : gfam2fun ] @xmath51 is a familial 2-functor . \n in particular it follows from the theory of @xcite that @xmath51 preserves conical connected limits as well as all the notions of `` grothendieck fibration '' which one can define internal to a finitely complete 2-category . \n moreover the obstruction maps for comma objects are right adjoints . \n see @xcite for more details on this part of 2-category theory . \n we shall not use these observations very much in what follows . \n more important for us is    [ lem : g - em - object ] @xmath51 preserves eilenberg - moore objects .    given a monad @xmath101 on a category @xmath16 , we shall write @xmath102 for the category of @xmath101-algebras and morphisms thereof , and @xmath103 for the forgetful functor \n . we shall denote a typical object of @xmath102 as a pair @xmath104 , where @xmath2 is the underlying object in @xmath16 and @xmath105 is the @xmath101-algebra structure . \n from @xcite the 2-cell @xmath106 , whose component at @xmath104 is @xmath107 itself has a universal property exhibiting @xmath102 as a kind of 2-categorical limit called an _ eilenberg - moore object_. see @xcite or @xcite for more details on this general notion . \n the direct proof that for any monad @xmath101 on a category @xmath16 , the obstruction map @xmath108 is an isomorphism comes down to the obvious fact that for any @xmath16-graph @xmath109 , a @xmath110-algebra structure on @xmath109 is the same thing as a @xmath101-algebra structure on the homs of @xmath109 , and similarly for algebra morphisms . \n let us recall the notions of lax monoidal category and category enriched therein from @xcite . \n for a category @xmath16 , the free strict monoidal category @xmath111 on @xmath16 has a very simple description . \n an object of @xmath111 is a finite sequence @xmath112 of objects of @xmath16 . \n a map is a sequence of maps of @xmath16  there are no maps between sequences of objects of different lengths . \n the unit @xmath113 of the 2-monad @xmath114 is the inclusion of sequences of length @xmath33 . \n the multiplication @xmath115 is given by concatenation . \n a _ lax monoidal category _ is a lax algebra for the 2-monad @xmath114 . \n explicitly it consists of an underlying category @xmath16 , a functor @xmath116 , and maps @xmath117 for all @xmath82 , @xmath118 from @xmath16 which are natural in their arguments , and such that @xmath119 ^ -{u\\ope\\limits_i } \\ar[d]_{1 } \\save \\pos?(.4)=\"domeq \" \\restore & { e_1\\ope\\limits_iz_i } \\ar[dl]^{\\sigma } \\save \\pos?(.4)=\"codeq \" \\restore \\\\ { \\ope\\limits_iz_i } \n \\pos \" domeq \" ; \" codeq \" * * @ { } ; ? \n * { = } } } } ; ( 4,0)*{\\xybox{\\xymatrix @c=1.5em { { \\ope\\limits_i\\ope\\limits_j\\ope\\limits_kz_{ijk } } \\ar[r]^-{{\\sigma}\\ope\\limits_k } \\ar[d]_{\\ope\\limits_i\\sigma } \\save \\pos?=\"domeq \" \\restore & { \\ope\\limits_{ij}\\ope\\limits_kz_{ijk } } \\ar[d]^{\\sigma } \\save \\pos?=\"codeq \" \\restore \\\\ { \\ope\\limits_i\\ope\\limits_{jk}z_{ijk } } \\ar[r]_-{\\sigma } & { \\ope\\limits_{ijk}z_{ijk } } \\pos \" domeq \" ; \" codeq \" * * @ { } ; ? * { = } } } } ; ( 8,0)*{\\xybox{{\\xymatrix @c=1em { { \\ope\\limits_ie_1z_i } \\ar[dr]_{\\sigma } \\save \\pos?(.4)=\"domeq \" \\restore & { \\ope\\limits_iz_i } \\ar[d]^{1 } \\save \\pos?(.4)=\"codeq \" \\restore   \\ar[l]_-{\\ope\\limits_iu } \\\\ & { \\ope\\limits_iz_i } } \\pos \" domeq \" ; \" codeq \" * * @ { } ; ? * { = } } } } \\endxy\\ ] ] in @xmath16 . as in @xcite \n we use either of the expressions @xmath120 as a convenient yet precise short - hand for @xmath121 , and we refer to the endofunctor of @xmath16 obtained by observing the effect of @xmath122 on singleton sequences as @xmath123 . \n the data @xmath124 is called a _ multitensor _ on @xmath16 , and @xmath125 and @xmath126 are referred to as the unit and substitution of the multitensor respectively . \n given a multitensor @xmath124 on @xmath16 , a _ category enriched in @xmath122 _ consists of @xmath127 together with maps @xmath128 for all @xmath40 and sequences @xmath129 of objects of @xmath2 , such that @xmath130{e_1x(x_0,x_1)}^-{u } : [ d]{x(x_0,x_1)}=\"bot\"^{\\kappa } , : \" bot\"_{\\id } ) } } } [ r(5)][d(.15 ) ] { \\xybox{\\xygraph{!{0;(2.75,0):(0,.5 ) : : } { \\ope\\limits_i\\ope\\limits_jx(x_{(ij)-1},x_{ij } ) } ( : [ r]{\\ope\\limits_{ij}x(x_{(ij)-1},x_{ij})}^-{\\sigma } : [ d]{x(x_0,x_{mn_m})}=\"bot\"^{\\kappa},:[d]{\\ope\\limits_ix(x_{(i1)-1},x_{in_i})}_{\\ope\\limits_i\\kappa } : \" bot\"_-{\\kappa})}}}}\\ ] ] commute , where @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 . \n since a choice of @xmath46 and @xmath134 references an element of the ordinal @xmath135 , the predecessor @xmath136 of the pair @xmath137 is well - defined when @xmath46 and @xmath134 are not both @xmath33 . with the obvious notion of @xmath122-functor ( see @xcite ) , \n one has a category @xmath138 of @xmath122-categories and @xmath122-functors together with a forgetful functor @xmath139 the notation we use makes transparent the analogy between multitensors and monads , and categories enriched in multitensors and algebras for a monad . in particular the unit and subtitution for @xmath122 provide @xmath123 with the unit and multiplication of a monad structure . \n moreover , any object of the form @xmath140 is canonically an @xmath123-algebra , as is the hom of any @xmath122-category , and the substitution maps of @xmath122 are @xmath123-algebra morphisms ( see @xcite lemma(2.7 ) ) . \n thus in a sense , any multitensor @xmath124 on a category @xmath16 is aspiring to be a multitensor on the category @xmath141 of @xmath123-algebras , but of course there is no meaningful way to regard @xmath125 as living in @xmath141 , except in the boring situation when @xmath123 is the identity monad , that is , when @xmath125 is an identity natural transformation . the multitensors with @xmath125 the identity are called _ normal_.    [ def : lift ] let @xmath124 be a multitensor on a category @xmath16 . \n a _ lift _ of @xmath124 is a normal multitensor @xmath142 on @xmath141 together with an isomorphism @xmath143 which commutes with the forgetful functors into @xmath144 .    in @xcite \n we explained how to associate normalised @xmath145-operads and @xmath0-multitensors , which are multitensors on the category of @xmath0-globular sets . in the present paper \n we shall explain why any @xmath0-multitensor has a canonical lift . \n at an abstract level much of this paper is about the interplay between the theory of monads on categories of enriched graphs , and the theory of multitensors . \n it is time to be more precise about which monads on @xmath18 we are interested in . \n [ def : nmnd ] let @xmath16 be a category . a monad _ over @xmath24 _ on @xmath18 is a monad on @xmath146 in the 2-category @xmath58 . \n that is , a monad @xmath147 on @xmath18 is over @xmath24 when the functor @xmath101 does nt affect the object sets , in other words @xmath148 for all @xmath127 and similarly for maps , and moreover the components of @xmath149 and @xmath150 are identities on objects . in this section \n we will describe how such a monad , in the case where @xmath16 has an initial object denoted as @xmath151 , induces a multitensor on @xmath16 denoted @xmath152 . \n let us describe this multitensor explicitly . \n first we note that @xmath153 enables us to regard any sequence of objects @xmath112 of @xmath16 as a @xmath16-graph . \n the object set is @xmath154 , @xmath155 for @xmath156 , and all the other homs are equal to @xmath151 . \n then we define @xmath157 and the unit as @xmath158 before defining @xmath159 we require some preliminaries . given objects @xmath160 of @xmath16 where @xmath156 , and @xmath161 denote by @xmath162 the obvious subsequence inclusion in @xmath18 : the object map preserves successor and @xmath163 , and the hom maps are identities . now given objects @xmath118 of @xmath16 \n where @xmath164 and @xmath132 , one has a map @xmath165 given on objects by @xmath166 and @xmath167 for @xmath164 , and the hom map between @xmath168 and @xmath46 is @xmath169 . with these definitions in hand \n we can now define the components of @xmath159 as @xmath170 ^ -{\\{t\\tilde{\\tau}\\}_{0,k } } & & { t(z_{11}, ... ,z_{kn_k})(0,n_{\\bullet } ) } \\ar[rr]^-{\\mu_{0,n_{\\bullet } } } & & { \\tbar\\limits_{ij}z_{ij}}}.\\ ] ] from now until the end of ( [ ssec : tbar ] ) we shall be occupied with the proof of    [ thm : tbar ] let @xmath16 be a category with an initial object @xmath151 and @xmath147 be a monad over @xmath24 on @xmath18 . \n then @xmath152 as defined in ( [ eq : tbar])-([eq : mubar ] ) defines a multitensor on @xmath16 . \n in principle one could supply a proof of this result immediately by just slogging through a direct verification of the axioms . \n instead we shall take a more conceptual approach , and along the way encounter various ideas that are of independent interest . for most of the time we will assume a little more of @xmath16 : that it has finite coproducts , to enable our more conceptual approach . in the end \n though , we will see that only the initial object is necessary . \n we break up the construction of @xmath152 into three steps . \n first in ( [ ssec : nmonad->monmonad ] ) , we describe how @xmath171 acquires a monoidal structure and @xmath147 induces a monoidal monad @xmath172 on @xmath171 . \n then we see that this monoidal monad induces a lax monoidal structure on @xmath171 , which in turn can be transferred across an adjunction to obtain @xmath152 . \n these last two steps are very general : they work at the level of the theory of lax algebras for an arbitrary 2-monad ( which in our case is @xmath114 ) . \n so in ( [ ssec : laxalg - const1 ] ) and ( [ ssec : laxalg - const2 ] ) we describe these general constructions , and in ( [ ssec : tbar ] ) we finish the proof of theorem([thm : tbar ] ) . \n finally in ( [ ssec : path - like ] ) we present a condition on @xmath101 which ensures that @xmath101-algebras and @xmath173-categories may be identified . \n from now until just before the end of ( [ ssec : tbar ] ) we shall assume that @xmath16 has finite coproducts . \n we now describe some consequences of this . \n first , the functor @xmath174 which sends an enriched graph to its set of objects becomes representable . \n we shall denote by @xmath26 the @xmath16-graph which represents @xmath175 . \n it has one object and its unique hom is @xmath151 . \n the second consequence is that @xmath171 inherits a natural monoidal structure and any normalised monad @xmath147 on @xmath18 can then be regarded as a monoidal monad @xmath172 . \n the explanation for this begins with the observation that the representability of the underlying set functor @xmath175 enables a useful reformulation of the category @xmath171 as the category of endocospans of @xmath26 as in section([ssec : enriched - graphs ] ) . \n the usefulness of this is that such cospans can be composed , thus endowing @xmath171 with a canonical monoidal structure . \n the presence of @xmath151 in @xmath16 enables one to compute coproducts in @xmath18 . \n the coproduct @xmath2 of a family @xmath176 of @xmath16-graphs has object set given as the disjoint union of the object sets of the @xmath177 , @xmath178 when @xmath107 and @xmath179 are objects of @xmath177 , and all the other homs are @xmath151 . \n with finite coproducts available one can also compute pushouts under @xmath26 , that is the pushout @xmath180 of maps @xmath181 ^ -{y } \\ar[l]_-{x } & y}\\ ] ] in @xmath18 is described as follows . the object set of @xmath180 \n is the disjoint union of the object sets of @xmath2 and @xmath182 modulo the identification of @xmath107 and @xmath179 , and let us write @xmath183 for this special element of @xmath180 . \n the homs of @xmath180 are inherited from @xmath2 and @xmath182 in almost the same way as for coproducts . \n that is if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are either both objects of @xmath2 or both objects of @xmath182 and they are not both @xmath183 , then their hom @xmath184 is taken as in @xmath2 or @xmath182 . \n the hom @xmath185 is the coproduct @xmath186 . \n otherwise this hom is @xmath151 . \n note that in the special case where the homs @xmath187 and @xmath188 are both @xmath151 , one only requires the initial object in @xmath16 to compute this pushout . \n given a sequence @xmath189 of doubly - pointed @xmath16-graphs , one defines their _ join _ \n @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the colimit of @xmath192_-{b_1 } \\ar[r]^-{a_2 } & { ... } & 0 \\ar[l]_-{b_{n-1 } } \\ar[r]^-{a_n } & { x_n}}\\ ] ] in @xmath18 which can be formed via iterated pushouts under @xmath26 . \n this defines a monoidal structure on @xmath171 whose tensor product we denote as @xmath193 . \n given a functor @xmath194 over @xmath24 , one has a functor @xmath195 whose object map is indicated on the right in the previous display . \n when both @xmath16 and @xmath196 have an initial object , one defines for each sequence of doubly - pointed @xmath16-graphs a map @xmath197 as follows . \n write @xmath198 for the components of the colimit cocones ( [ eq : join ] ) . using the unique map @xmath199 \n , there is a unique map @xmath200 such that @xmath201 . by the unique characterisation of these maps \n , they assemble together to provide the coherence 2-cell @xmath202 ^ -

pointed @xmath16-graphs @xmath42 such that @xmath247 and @xmath248 are actually used in the construction of the multitensor and in its axioms , and these only require an initial object in @xmath16 . \n we shall now give a condition on a normalised monad @xmath101 which ensures that categories enriched in @xmath173 are the same thing as @xmath101-algebras . \n let @xmath249 and consider a sequence @xmath250 of objects of @xmath2 such that @xmath251 and @xmath252 . \n define the @xmath16-graph @xmath253 and we have a map @xmath254 given on objects by @xmath255 for @xmath256 , and the effect on the hom between @xmath168 and @xmath46 is the identity for @xmath156 .    [ def : path - like ] let @xmath16 be a category with an initial object and @xmath196 be a category with all small coproducts . \n a functor @xmath194 over @xmath24 is _ path - like _ when for all @xmath249 , the maps @xmath257 for all @xmath40 and sequences @xmath250 such that @xmath251 and @xmath252 , form a coproduct cocone in @xmath196 . \n a normalised monad @xmath147 on @xmath258 is _ path -

likeness \n these amount to giving for each @xmath40 and @xmath250 such that @xmath268 and @xmath269 , a map @xmath270 since @xmath271 , that is @xmath272 . \n when @xmath273 , for a given @xmath274 , @xmath107 can only be the sequence @xmath275 . \n the naturality square for @xmath149 at @xmath276 implies that @xmath277 , and the definition of @xmath278 says that @xmath279 . thus to say that a map @xmath266 satisfies the unit law of a @xmath101-algebra is to say that @xmath29 is the identity on objects and that the @xmath280 described above satisfy the unit axioms of a @xmath173-category .    to say that @xmath29 satisfies \n the associative law is to say that for all @xmath274 , @xmath281 ^ -{\\{\\mu_x\\}_{y , z } } \\ar[d]_{tx_{y , z } } & { tx(y , z ) } \\ar[d]^{a_{y , z } } \\\\ { tx(y , z ) } \n \\ar[r]_-{a_{y , z } } & { x(y , z)}}\\ ] ] commutes . given @xmath250 from @xmath2 with @xmath268 and @xmath269 , and @xmath282 from @xmath283 with @xmath284 and @xmath285 , \n consider the composite map @xmath286 ^ -{t\\overline{w}_{0,k } } & { t^2x^*x(0,n ) } \\ar[r]^-{t\\overline{x}_{0,n } } & { t^2x(y , z)}}\\ ] ] and note that by path - likeness , and since the coproduct of coproducts is a coproduct , all such maps for @xmath107 and @xmath287 such that @xmath268 and @xmath269 form a coproduct cocone . \n precomposing ( [ eq : assoc1 ] ) with ( [ eq : copr ] ) gives the commutativity of @xmath288 ^ -{\\overline{\\mu } } \\ar[d]_{\\tbar\\limits_ia } & { \\tbar\\limits_{ij}x(x_{ij-1},x_{ij } ) } \\ar[d]^{a_x } \\\\ { \\tbar\\limits_ix(x_{w_{i-1}},x_{w_i } ) } \\ar[r]_-{a_w } & { x(y , z)}}\\ ] ] and conversely by the previous sentence if these squares commute for all @xmath107 and @xmath287 , then one recovers the commutativity of ( [ eq : assoc1 ] ) . \n this completes the description of the object part of @xmath265 . \n let @xmath289 and @xmath290 be @xmath101-algebras and @xmath291 be a @xmath16-graph morphism . to say that @xmath292 is a @xmath101-algebra map is a condition on the maps @xmath293 for all @xmath274 , and one uses path - likeness in the obvious way to see that this is equivalent to saying that the @xmath294 are the hom maps for a @xmath173-functor . \n the proof of proposition([prop : pl - alg<->cat ] ) is not new : exactly the same argument was used in the second half of the proof of theorem(7.6 ) of @xcite , although in that case the setting was far less general . \n the real novelty is the generality of definition([def : path - like ] ) which is crucial for section([sec : lift - mult ] ) . \n the general way of obtaining a monad from a multitensor , which is the topic of this section , applies to multitensors which conform to    [ def : dist - mult ] let @xmath16 be a category with small coproducts . \n then a multitensor @xmath124 is _ distributive _ when the functor @xmath122 preserves coproducts in each variable . that is to say , for each @xmath40 , the functor @xmath295 obtained by observing @xmath122 s effect on sequences of length @xmath0 , preserves coproducts in each of its @xmath0 variables . \n the first step in associating a monad to a distributive multitensor is to identify the bicategory @xmath296 which has the property that monads in @xmath296 are exactly distributive multitensors in the sense of definition([def : dist - mult ] ) . \n there is also a useful reformulation of the notion of monad on @xmath18 over @xmath24 : as a monad in another 2-category @xmath297 where @xmath298 denotes the 2-comonad on @xmath99 induced by the adjunction @xmath299 of section([ssec : enriched - graphs ] ) . \n our monad - from - multitensor construction is then achieved by means of a pseudo functor ( homomorphism of bicategories ) @xmath300 which as a pseudo functor sends monads to monads . \n in fact for a distributive multitensor @xmath122 , @xmath301 is path - like and so @xmath302 . \n the objects of @xmath296 are categories with coproducts . \n a morphism @xmath303 in @xmath296 is a functor @xmath304 which preserves coproducts in each variable . \n a 2-cell between @xmath122 and @xmath305 is simply a natural transformation between these functors @xmath306 . \n vertical composition of 2-cells is as for natural transformations . \n the horizontal composite of @xmath307 and @xmath308 , denoted @xmath309 , is defined as a left kan extension @xmath310 ^ -{\\mu } \\ar[d]_{mf } \\save \\pos?=\"dom \" \\restore & { mv } \\ar[d]^{e \\comp f } \\save \\pos?=\"cod \" \\restore \\\\ \n { mw } \\ar[r]_-{e } & { x } \\pos \" dom \" ; \" cod \" * * @ { } ?

functor . \n of course one could just define @xmath301 via the formula in corollary([cor : explicit - gamma ] ) . \n we chose instead to give the above more abstract definition , because it will enable us to attain a more natural understanding of why @xmath22 produces _ path - like _ monads from distributive multitensors in ( [ ssec : distmult->monad ] ) . \n conceptually , the reason why the left kan extension @xmath322 involves only coproducts in @xmath196 is that @xmath321 is a local left adjoint . \n a functor @xmath323 is a _ local left adjoint _ when @xmath324 is a local right adjoint . \n this is equivalent to asking that for all @xmath73 the induced functor @xmath325 between coslices is a left adjoint . \n we shall explain in lemma([lem : spancomp - lra ] ) why and how pullback - composition of spans can be seen as a local right adjoint , and the statement that @xmath321 is a local left adjoint is just the dual of this because @xmath321 is defined as pushout - composition of cospans in @xmath18 . in lemma([lem : lla - ple ] ) we give a formula for computing the left kan extension along a local left adjoint , and this will then be applied to give our promised more explicit description of @xmath22 s one - cell map . \n [ lem : spancomp - lra ] let @xmath1 be a category with finite products and let @xmath29 be an object of @xmath1 such that @xmath326 also has finite products . \n then the one - cell part @xmath327 of the monoidal structure on @xmath328 given by span composition is a local right adjoint . \n note that for all @xmath40 the slices @xmath329 , where @xmath330 is the @xmath0-fold cartesian product of @xmath29 , have finite products , so the statement of the lemma makes sense and all the limits we mention in this proof exist . \n in general a functor out of a coproduct of categories is a local right adjoint iff its composite with each coproduct inclusion is a local right adjoint . \n thus it suffices to show that @xmath0-fold composition of spans @xmath331 is a local right adjoint for all @xmath40 . \n the case @xmath332 may be exhibited as a composite @xmath333 ^ -{1_a } & { a / a } \\ar[r]^-{\\delta _ ! } & { a / a{\\times}a}}\\ ] ] of local right adjoints and thus is a local right adjoint . \n the case @xmath273 may be regarded as the identity . \n it suffices to verify the case @xmath334 because with this in hand an easy induction will give the general case . \n the pullback composite of spans as shown on the left @xmath335 b ( [ dl ] { a}=\"a1 \" , [ dr ] { a}=\"a2 \" ) , [ dr ] c [ dr ] { a}=\"a3 \" ) \" d\":\"b\"_{p}:\"a1\"_{w } \" d\":\"c\"^{q}:\"a3\"^{z } \" b\":\"a2\"^{x } \" c\":\"a2\"_{y } \" d \" [ d(.3)l(.3 ) ] [ d(.1)r(.1)]:@{-}[d(.2)r(.2)]:@{-}[u(.2)r(.2 ) ] } } [ r(4 ) ] * \\xybox{\\xygraph{!{0;(1.2,0):(0,.7 ) : : } d [ r ] { b{\\times}c}=\"bc \" [ d ] { a^4}=\"a4 \" [ l ] { a^3}=\"a3 \" [ d ] { a^2}=\"a2 \" \" d\"(:@{.>}\"a3\"_{(wp , xp = yq , zq)}(:@{.>}\"a2\"_{(\\pi_1,\\pi_3)},:\"a4\"_-{a{\\times}\\delta{\\times}a } ) , : \" bc\"^-{(p , q)}:\"a4\"^{(w , x){\\times}(y , z ) } \" d \" [ d(.3 ) ] [ r(.1)]:@{-}[r(.2)]:@{-}[u(.2)]}}}\\ ] ] may be constructed as the dotted composite shown on the right in the previous display , and so binary composition of endospans of @xmath29 is encoded by the composite functor @xmath336 ^ -{\\textnormal{prod}_{(a^2,a^2 ) } } & { a/(a^4 ) } \\ar[r]^-{(a{\\times}\\delta{\\times}a)^ * } & { a/(a^3 ) } \\ar[r]^-{(\\pi_1,\\pi_3 ) _ ! } & { a / a{\\times}a}}\\ ] ] where @xmath337 denotes the ( right adjoint ) functor @xmath338 which sends a pair to its cartesian product ( and @xmath339 is the slice of @xmath337 over the pair @xmath340 ) . \n the constituent functors of this last composite are clearly all local right adjoints . \n recall @xcite @xcite that local right adjoints can be characterised in terms of generic factorisations . \n the dual characterisation is as follows . \n a functor @xmath323 is a local left adjoint iff for all @xmath341 the components of the comma category @xmath342 have terminal objects . \n a map @xmath343 which is terminal in its component of @xmath342 is said to be _ cogeneric _ , and by definition any @xmath76 can be factored as @xmath344 ^ -{fh } & { fc } \\ar[r]^-{g } & b}\\ ] ] where @xmath345 is cogeneric . \n this factorisation is unique up to unique isomorphism and is called the _ cogeneric factorisation _ of @xmath76 . \n [ lem : lla -

psfunctor ] the coherences @xmath385 just defined make @xmath22 into a pseudo - functor . \n given a monad @xmath101 on @xmath18 over @xmath24 , and a set @xmath82 , one obtains by restriction a monad @xmath386 on the category @xmath387 of @xmath16-graphs with fixed object set @xmath82 . \n let us write @xmath388 for the functor labelled as @xmath22 in @xcite . \n then for a given distributive multitensor @xmath122 , our present @xmath22 and @xmath388 are related by the formula @xmath389 where the @xmath33 on the right hand side of this equation indicates a singleton . in other words \n we have just given the `` many - objects version '' of the theory presented in @xcite section(4 ) . \n having just established the machinery to convert distributive multitensors on @xmath16 to monads on @xmath18 over @xmath24 , we shall now relate the enriched categories to the algebras . \n this involves two things : seeing that the normalised monads constructed from distributive multitensors are path -

like iff the 2-cell on the left exhibits @xmath393 as a colimit . to see this recall from ( [ ssec : gamma ] ) that the set of components of @xmath394 may be regarded as the set of sequences of objects of @xmath6 starting at @xmath29 and finishing at @xmath30 , that each of these components has a terminal object , and that @xmath395 is terminal in the component corresponding to the sequence @xmath250 \n the situation for a given @xmath122 is depicted on the right in the previous display , and by definition this composite 2-cell is a colimit . \n thus it suffices to show that the component of the 2-cell @xmath322 at @xmath396 is invertible for all sequences @xmath250 from @xmath6 . \n the component of @xmath322 at a general @xmath397 is the coproduct inclusion @xmath398 ^ -{c_w } & & { \\coprod\\limits_{(z_0, ... ,z_m ) } \\ope\\limits_i y(z_{i-1},z_i)}}\\ ] ] corresponding to the sequence @xmath399 where @xmath400 . in the case of @xmath401 , @xmath402 , and for summands corresponding to sequences @xmath183 different from @xmath287 \n , we will have @xmath403 for some @xmath46 . by the distributivity of @xmath122 \n those summands will be @xmath151 , whence @xmath404 will be invertible .    given a distributive multitensor @xmath124 note that one can apply @xmath22 to it and then @xmath405 to the result . \n one has @xmath406 where the @xmath407 in the sum are elements of @xmath154 and @xmath408 and @xmath409 . \n unless the sequence @xmath410 is just an in - order list @xmath411 of the elements of @xmath154 , at least one of the homs @xmath412 must be @xmath151 making that summand @xmath151 by the distributivity of @xmath122 . \n thus the coproduct inclusion @xmath413 is invertible . moreover using the explicit description of the multitensor @xmath414 \n one may verify that this isomorphism is compatible with the units and substitutions , and so we have    [ lem : gamma - bar ] if @xmath124 is a distributive multitensor on a category @xmath16 with coproducts , then one has an isomorphism @xmath415 of multitensors . \n together with lemma([lem : gamma - path - like ] ) and proposition([prop : pl - alg<->cat ] ) this implies    [ cor : gamma - alg - ecat ] if @xmath124 is a distributive multitensor on a category @xmath16 with coproducts , then one has @xmath302 commuting with the forgetful functors into @xmath18 . \n we now describe the sense in which @xmath22 and @xmath405 are adjoint . \n first let us note that equation([eq : tbar ] ) defining the construction @xmath405 in section([ssec : defnmonad ] ) may be seen as providing functors @xmath416 for all @xmath417 in @xmath99 . \n we have abused notation slightly by denoting by @xmath18 ( resp . \n @xmath258 ) the category of @xmath16-enriched graphs together with its forgetful functor into @xmath24 . in ( [ ssec : defnmonad ] ) \n we considered only the case @xmath418 and when @xmath419 is part of a monad , but equation([eq : tbar ] ) obviously makes sense in this more general context . in order to relate this with @xmath22 \n we make    [ def : ndist ] let @xmath16 and @xmath196 have coproducts . \n a functor @xmath420 over @xmath24 is _ distributive _ when @xmath421 preserves coproducts in each variable . \n we denote by @xmath422 the full subcategory of @xmath423 consisting of the distributive functors from @xmath18 to @xmath258 . \n [ prop : pl - adjoint - char ] let @xmath16 and @xmath196 be categories with coproducts . \n then we have an adjunction @xmath424 { \\ndist(v , w)}=\"nd \" \" d\":@<1ex>\"nd\"^-{\\gamma_{v , w}}|{}=\"t\":@<1ex>\"d\"^-{\\overline{(-)}_{v , w}}|{}=\"b \" \" t\":@{}\"b\"|-{\\perp}}\\ ] ] whose unit is invertible . \n a distributive @xmath420 is in the image of @xmath425 iff it is path - like .    by lemma([lem : \n gamma - bar ] ) applying @xmath22 does indeed produce a distributive functor , so @xmath425 is well - defined and one has an isomorphism of @xmath426 with the identity . for @xmath127 and @xmath261 one \n has @xmath427 induced by the hom - maps of @xmath263 , giving @xmath428 natural in @xmath101 , and so by @xcite lemma(2.6 ) to establish the adjunction it suffices to show that @xmath429 is inverted by @xmath405 . to this end note \n that when @xmath430 for @xmath431 , the above summands are non - initial iff the sequence @xmath432 is the sequence @xmath433 , by the distributivity of @xmath101 . \n the characterisation of path - likeness now follows too , since this condition on a given @xmath101 is by definition the same as the invertibility of @xmath434 .    an immediate consequence of proposition([prop : pl - adjoint - char ] ) and proposition([prop : gammae - basic])([geb1 ] ) below is the following result . \n a direct proof is also quite straight forward and is left as an exercise . \n [ cor : pl->copr - pres ] let @xmath16 and @xmath196 be categories with coproducts . \n if @xmath420 over @xmath24 is distributive and path - like , then it preserves coproducts . \n [ [ ssec : intro - reexpress ] ]    let us now regard @xmath22 as a pseudo - functor @xmath435 that is to say , we take for granted the inclusion of @xmath297 in @xmath58 . in this section we shall give a systematic account of the categorical properties that @xmath22 preserves . \n the machinery we are developing gives an elegant inductive description of the monads @xmath436 for strict @xmath0-categories , provides explanations of some of their key properties , and gives a shorter account of the central result of @xcite on the equivalence between @xmath0-multitensors and @xmath145-operads . \n let @xmath392 be a regular cardinal . \n an object @xmath346 in a category @xmath16 is _ connected _ when the representable functor @xmath437 preserves coproducts , and @xmath346 is _ \n @xmath392-presentable _ when @xmath437 preserves @xmath392-filtered colimits . \n the object @xmath346 is said to be _ small _ when it is @xmath392-presentable for some regular cardinal @xmath392 . \n a category @xmath16 is _ extensive _ when it has coproducts and for all families @xmath438 of objects of @xmath16 , the functor @xmath439 is an equivalence of categories . \n a more elementary characterisation is that @xmath16 is extensive iff it has coproducts , pullbacks along coproduct coprojections and given a family of commutative squares @xmath440 \n ^ -{c_i } \\ar[d]_{f_i } & x \\ar[d]^{f } \\\\ { y_i } \\ar[r]_-{d_i } & y}\\ ] ] where @xmath441 such that the @xmath442 form a coproduct cocone , the @xmath443 form a coproduct cocone iff these squares are all pullbacks . \n it follows that coproducts are disjoint and the initial object of @xmath16 is strict . \n another sufficient condition for extensivity is provided by    [ lem : easy - ext ] if a category @xmath16 has disjoint coproducts and a strict initial object , and every @xmath444 is a coproduct of connected objects , then @xmath16 is extensive . \n the proof is left as an easy exercise . \n note this condition is not necessary : there are many extensive categories whose objects do nt decompose into coproducts of connected objects , for example , take the topos of sheaves on a space which is not locally connected . \n a category is _ lextensive _ when it is extensive and has finite limits . \n there are many examples of lextensive categories : grothendieck toposes , the category of algebras of any higher operad and the category of topological spaces and continuous maps are all lextensive .    denoting the terminal object of a lextensive category @xmath16 by @xmath33 , the representable @xmath445 has a left exact left adjoint @xmath446 which sends a set @xmath82 to the copower @xmath447 . \n this functor enables one to express coproduct decompositions of objects of @xmath16 , _ internal to @xmath16 _ because to give a map @xmath448 in @xmath16 is the same thing as giving an @xmath34-indexed coproduct decomposition of @xmath2 . \n the lextensive categories in which every object decomposes into a sum of connected objects are characterised by the following well - known result . \n [ prop : lext - decompose - charn ] for a lextensive category @xmath16 the following statements are equivalent :    1 . \n every @xmath444 can be expressed as a coproduct of connected objects.[copcon ] 2 . \n the functor @xmath449 has a left adjoint.[pi0 ]    the most common instance of this is when @xmath16 is a grothendieck topos . \n the toposes @xmath16 satisfying the equivalent conditions of proposition([prop : lext - decompose - charn ] ) are said to be _ locally connected_. this terminology is reasonable since for a topological space @xmath2 , one has that @xmath2 is locally connected as a space iff its associated topos of sheaves is locally connected in this sense . \n a set @xmath450 of objects of @xmath16 is a _ strong generator _ when for all maps @xmath48 , if @xmath451 is bijective for all @xmath452 then @xmath76 is an isomorphism . \n a locally small category @xmath16 is _ locally @xmath392-presentable _ when it is cocomplete and has a strong generator consisting of small objects . finally recall that a functor is _ accessible _ when it preserves @xmath392-filtered colimits for some regular cardinal @xmath392 . \n the theory of locally presentable categories is one of the high points of classical category theory , and this notion admits many alternative characterisations @xcite @xcite @xcite . for instance locally presentable categories are exactly those categories which are the @xmath24-valued models for a limit sketch . \n grothendieck toposes are locally presentable because each covering sieve in a grothendieck topology on a category @xmath453 gives rise to a cone in @xmath454 , and a sheaf is exactly a functor @xmath455 which sends these cones to limit cones in @xmath24 . \n that is to say a grothendieck topos can be seen as the models of a limit sketch which one obtains in an obvious way from any site which presents it . just as locally presentable categories generalise grothendieck toposes , the following notion generalises locally connected grothendieck toposes . \n [ def : lcc ] a locally small category @xmath16 is _ locally c - presentable _ when it is cocomplete and has a strong generator consisting of small connected objects . \n just as locally presentable categories have many alternative characterisations we have the following result for locally c - presentable categories . \n its proof is obtained by applying the general results of @xcite in the case of the doctrine for @xmath392-small connected categories , which is `` sound '' ( see @xcite ) , and proposition([prop : lext - decompose - charn ] ) . \n [ thm : conn - gabulm ] for a locally small category @xmath16 the following statements are equivalent .    1 . \n @xmath16 is locally c - presentable.[lc1 ] 2 . \n @xmath16 is cocomplete and has a small dense subcategory consisting of small connected objects.[lc2 ] 3 . \n @xmath16 is a full subcategory of a presheaf category for which the inclusion is accessible , coproduct preserving and has a left adjoint.[lc4 ] 4 . \n @xmath16 is the category of models for a limit sketch whose distingished cones are connected.[lc5 ] 5 . \n @xmath16 is locally presentable and every object of @xmath16 is a coproduct of connected objects.[lc6 ] 6 . \n @xmath16 is locally presentable , extensive and the functor @xmath456 has a left adjoint.[lc7 ]    [ ex : lc - groth - toposes ] by theorem([thm : conn - gabulm])([lc7 ] ) a grothendieck topos is locally connected in the usual sense iff its underlying category is locally c - presentable . \n just as with locally presentable categories , locally c - presentable categories are closed under many basic categorical constructions . \n for instance from theorem([thm : conn - gabulm])([lc6 ] ) , one sees immediately that the slices of a locally c - presentable category are locally c - presentable from the corresponding result for locally presentable categories . \n another instance of this principle is the following result . \n [ thm : acc - monad ] if @xmath16 is locally c - presentable and @xmath101 is an accessible coproduct preserving monad on @xmath16 , then @xmath102 is locally c - presentable . \n first we recall that colimits in @xmath102 can be constructed explicitly using colimits in @xmath16 and the accessibility of @xmath101 ( see for instance @xcite for a discussion of this ) . by definition \n we have a regular cardinal @xmath392 such that @xmath101 preserves @xmath392-filtered colimits and @xmath16 is locally @xmath392-presentable . defining @xmath457 to be the full subcategory of @xmath16 consisting of the @xmath392-presentable and connected objects \n , @xmath458 is a monad with arities in the sense of @xcite . \n one has a canonical isomorphism @xmath459 ^ -{v^t(i,1 ) } \\ar[d]_{u } \\save \\pos?=\"d \" \\restore & { \\psh { \\theta}_t } \\ar[d]^{\\res_j } \\save \\pos?=\"c \" \\restore \\\\ v \\ar[r]_-{v(i_0,1 ) } & { \\psh { \\theta}_0 } \\pos \" d\";\"c \" * * @ { } ; ? * { \\iso}}\\ ] ] in the notation of @xcite . \n thus @xmath460 is accessible since @xmath461 creates colimits , and @xmath101 and @xmath462 are accessible . by the nerve theorem of @xcite @xmath460 \n is also fully faithful , it has a left adjoint since @xmath102 is cocomplete given by left extending @xmath46 along the yoneda embedding , and so we have exhibited @xmath102 as conforming to theorem([thm : conn - gabulm])([lc4 ] ) . \n [ ex : lc - noperad - algebras ] an @xmath0-operad for @xmath463 in the sense of @xcite , gives a finitary coproduct preserving monad on the category @xmath8 of @xmath0-globular sets , and its algebras are just the algebras of the monad . \n thus the category of algebras of any @xmath0-operad is locally c - presentable by theorem([thm : acc - monad ] ) .      at the object level , to apply @xmath22 is to apply @xmath51 , so we shall now collect together many of the categorical properties that @xmath51 preserves . for @xmath16 with an initial object @xmath151 , we saw in section([ssec : nmonad->monmonad ] ) how to construct coproducts in @xmath18 explicitly . from this explicit construction , it is clear that the connected components of a @xmath16-graph @xmath2 may be described as follows . \n objects @xmath29 and @xmath30 of @xmath2 are in the same connected component iff there exists a sequence @xmath129 of objects of @xmath2 such that for @xmath156 the hom @xmath464 is non - initial . \n moreover @xmath2 is clearly the coproduct of its connected components , coproducts are disjoint and the initial object of @xmath18 , whose @xmath24 of objects is empty , is strict . \n thus by lemma([lem : easy - ext ] ) we obtain    [ prop : gv - ext ] if @xmath16 has an initial object then @xmath18 is extensive and every object of @xmath18 is a coproduct of connected objects . \n given finite limits in @xmath16 it is straight forward to construct finite limits in @xmath18 directly . \n the terminal @xmath16-graph has one object and its only hom is the terminal object of @xmath16 . \n given maps @xmath465 and @xmath466 in @xmath18 their pullback @xmath180 can be constructed as follows . \n objects are pairs @xmath467 where @xmath29 is an object of @xmath1 and @xmath231 is an object of @xmath346 such that @xmath468 . \n the hom @xmath469 is obtained as the pullback of @xmath470 ^ -{f } & { b(fa_1,fa_2 ) } & { c(c_1,c_2 ) } \\ar[l]_-{g}}\\ ] ] in @xmath16 . \n thus one has    [ prop : gv -

gamma ] ) since @xmath348 is connected . since @xmath122 is a local right adjoint , @xmath549 is too and so one can generically factor @xmath593 to obtain @xmath594 ^ -{g'_f } & { \\ope\\limits_iz_i } \\ar[r]^-{\\ope\\limits_it } & { e_n1}}\\ ] ] from which we obtain the generic factorisation @xmath595 ^ \n -{g_f } & { \\gamma{e}z } \\ar[r]^-{\\gamma{e}t } & { \\gamma{e}1}}\\ ] ] where @xmath596 , the object map of @xmath358 is given by @xmath166 and @xmath597 , and the hom map of @xmath358 is @xmath598 composed with the coproduct inclusion . \n first note that while it is a very different thing for @xmath304 to preserve coproducts compared with preserving coproducts in each variable , the situation is simpler for @xmath392-filtered colimits , where @xmath392 is any regular cardinal . \n note that @xmath599 preserves @xmath392-filtered colimits in each variable iff @xmath292 preserves @xmath392-filtered colimits . \n for given a connected category @xmath346 , the colimit of a functor @xmath600 constant at say @xmath2 is of course @xmath2 , and since @xmath392-filtered colimits are connected , one can prove @xmath601 by keeping all but the variable of interest constant . \n for the converse it is sufficient to prove that @xmath292 preserves colimits of chains of length less than @xmath392 , and this follows by a straight forward transfinite induction . \n since @xmath111 is a sum of @xmath602 s , from the connectedness of @xmath392-filtered colimits it is clear that @xmath122 preserves @xmath392-filtered colimits iff each @xmath603 does , and so we have proved    [ lem : multi - lambda ] for @xmath304 the following statements are equivalent for any regular cardinal @xmath392 .    1 . \n @xmath122 preserves @xmath392-filtered colimits in each variable . \n @xmath122 preserves @xmath392-filtered colimits . \n @xmath603 preserves @xmath392-filtered colimits for all @xmath40 . \n as already mentioned , colimits in @xmath18 for a cocomplete @xmath16 were calculated in @xcite . \n let us spell out transfinite composition in @xmath18 . \n given an ordinal @xmath392 and a @xmath392-chain @xmath604 in @xmath18 with colimit @xmath2 , one may consider the induced @xmath392-chain @xmath605 in @xmath24 . \n this will have colimit @xmath606 because @xmath392-filtered colimits and products commute in @xmath24 and @xmath607 is cocontinuous . for @xmath377 \n let us denote by @xmath608 the full subcategory of the category of elements of ( [ chain2 ] ) , consisting of those elements which are sent to @xmath47 by the universal cocone . \n we shall call this the _ @xmath47-component _ of the chain ( [ chain1 ] ) . \n now @xmath608 is of course no longer a chain , but one may easily verify that it is @xmath392-filtered . by the explicit description of colimits in @xmath24 , the @xmath608 are just the connected components of the category of elements of ( [ chain2 ] ) . \n to pairs @xmath609 which are elements of @xmath608 , one may associate the corresponding hom @xmath610 , and in this way build a functor @xmath611 . \n the hom @xmath31 is the colimit of this functor . \n [ prop : gamma - accessible ] let @xmath16 and @xmath196 be cocomplete , @xmath304 be distributive and @xmath392 be a regular cardinal . \n if @xmath122 preserves @xmath392-filtered colimits in each variable then @xmath301 preserves @xmath392-filtered colimits . \n it suffices to show @xmath301 preserves colimits of @xmath392-chains . \n consider the chain ( [ chain1 ] ) in @xmath18 . \n for all @xmath40 one has an @xmath145-ary version of ( [ chain2 ] ) , that is involving @xmath145-fold instead of binary cartesian products in @xmath24 . \n these of course also commute with @xmath392-filtered colimits . \n similarly one obtains a @xmath392-filtered category @xmath612 and a functor @xmath613 applying @xmath301 does nothing at the object level . \n let us write @xmath614 for the @xmath47-component of the chain obtained by applying @xmath301 to ( [ chain1 ] ) , and @xmath615 for the corresponding functor into @xmath196 . from the explicit description of @xmath22 s effect on homs of corollary([cor : explicit - gamma ] ) \n , one sees that @xmath615 is the coproduct of the composites @xmath616 ^ -{f_{x_0, ... ,x_n } } & { v^n } \\ar[r]^-{e_n } & w}.\\ ] ] over all sequences @xmath129 starting at @xmath29 and finishing at @xmath30 . by lemma([lem : multi - lambda ] ) the colimits of the @xmath617 are preserved by the @xmath549 , and so by the explicit description of colimits of @xmath392-chains in @xmath258 , the colimit of ( [ chain1 ] ) is indeed preserved by @xmath301 . \n let us recall the construction @xmath618 . given a monad @xmath147 on @xmath16 a category with products \n , one has a multitensor @xmath619 defined by @xmath620 and the unit and substitution is induced in the obvious way from @xmath149 and @xmath150 . \n when @xmath16 is lextensive , @xmath101 is a local right adjoint , and @xmath149 and @xmath150 are cartesian , it follows that @xmath619 is a local right adjoint its unit and multiplication are also cartesian . \n when @xmath101 preserves coproducts and the cartesian product for @xmath16 is distributive , then @xmath619 is a distributive multitensor . \n if in addition finite limits and filtered colimits commute in @xmath16 ( which happens when , for example @xmath16 is locally finitely presentable ) , then @xmath619 is finitary . \n moreover by proposition(2.8 ) of @xcite one has @xmath621 where the enrichment on the right hand side is with respect to cartesian products . \n thus one can consider the following inductively - defined sequence of monads    * put @xmath622 equal to the identity monad on @xmath24 . \n * given a monad @xmath9 on @xmath623 , define the monad @xmath624 on @xmath625 . \n recalling that @xmath623 is the category of @xmath0-globular sets . \n @xcite[thm : enhopi - main - theorem ] for @xmath40 , @xmath626 is the strict @xmath0-category monad on @xmath0-globular sets . \n this monad is coproduct preserving , finitary and local right adjoint .    by ( [ eq : tcross - cat ] ) and corollary([cor : gamma - alg - ecat ] ) \n , one has @xmath627 and so by definition @xmath628 is the category of strict @xmath0-categories and strict @xmath0-functors between them . by the remarks at the beginning of this section and corollary([cor : gv - topos ] ) @xmath629 will produce a distributive , finitary , local right adjoint multitensor on a presheaf category when it is fed a coproduct preserving , finitary , local right adjoint monad on a presheaf category . by corollary([cor : gv - topos ] ) , proposition([prop : gammae - basic ] ) , proposition([prop : gamma - accessible ] ) , proposition([prop : gammae - lra ] ) and proposition([prop : gamma - cart2 ] ) , @xmath22 will produce a coproduct preserving , finitary , local right adjoint monad on a presheaf category when it is fed a distributive , finitary , local right adjoint multitensor on a presheaf category . \n thus the monads @xmath626 are indeed coproduct preserving , finitary and local right adjoint for all @xmath40 .    the objects of @xmath630 \n @xmath0-operads over @xmath24  were in @xcite @xcite called `` normalised '' @xmath0-operads . many @xmath0-categorical structures of interest , such as weak @xmath0-categories , can be defined as algebras of @xmath0-operads over @xmath24 . \n objects of @xmath631 are called @xmath0-multitensors . \n these are a nice class of lax monoidal structures on the category of @xmath0-globular sets . by corollary([cor : mult - nop - equiv ] ) and theorem([thm : enhopi - main - theorem ] ) one obtains    @xcite[cor : nnp1op - nmult ] for all @xmath40 , applying @xmath22 gives @xmath632 . \n that is to say , @xmath22 exhibits @xmath145-operads over @xmath24 and @xmath0-multitensors as the same thing , and under this correspondence , the algebras of the operad correspond to the categories enriched in the associated multitensor by corollary([cor : gamma - alg - ecat ] ) . \n up to this point @xmath22 has been our notation for the process @xmath633 and @xmath405 has been our notation for the reverse construction . for the most complete analysis of these constructions one must acknowledge that they are the object maps of 2-functors in two important ways . \n this 2-functoriality together with the formal theory of monads @xcite gives a satisfying explanation of how it is that monad distributive laws arise naturally in this subject ( see @xcite ) . \n as the lax - algebras of a 2-monad @xmath114 ( see section([ssec : lmc ] ) ) , lax monoidal categories form a 2-category @xmath234 . \n see @xcite for a complete description of the 2-category of lax algebras for an arbitrary 2-monad . \n explicitly a lax monoidal functor between lax monoidal categories @xmath634 and @xmath635 consists of a functor @xmath636 , and maps @xmath637 natural in the @xmath177 such that @xmath638 { f_1hx}=\"r \" [ dl ] { he_1x}=\"b \" \" l\"(:\"r\"^-{u_{hx}}:\"b\"^{\\psi_x},:\"b\"_{hu_x } ) } } } [ r(5 ) ] { \\xybox{\\xygraph{!{0;(2,0):(0,.5 ) : : } { \\opf\\limits_i\\opf\\limits_jhx_{ij}}=\"tl \" [ r ] { \\opf\\limits_ih\\ope\\limits_jx_{ij}}=\"tm \" [ r ] { h\\ope\\limits_i\\ope\\limits_jx_{ij}}=\"tr \" [ l(.5)d ] { h\\ope\\limits_{ij}x_{ij}}=\"br \" [ l ] { \\opf\\limits_{ij}hx_{ij}}=\"bl \" \" tl \" ( : @<1ex>\"tm\"^-{\\opf\\limits_i\\psi}:@<1ex>\"tr\"^-{\\psi\\ope\\limits_j}:\"br\"^{h\\sigma},:\"bl\"_{\\sigma{h}}:@<1ex>\"br\"_-{\\psi})}}}}\\ ] ] commute for all @xmath2 and @xmath639 in @xmath16 . a monoidal natural transformation between lax monoidal functors @xmath640 consists of a natural transformation @xmath641 such that @xmath642 { h\\ope\\limits_ix_i}=\"tr \" [ d ] { k\\ope\\limits_ix_i}=\"br \" [ l ] { \\opf\\limits_ikx_i}=\"bl \" \" tl \" ( : @<1ex>\"tr\"^-{\\psi}:\"br\"^{\\phi\\ope\\limits_i},:\"bl\"_{\\opf\\limits_i\\phi}:@<1ex>\"br\"_-{\\kappa})}\\ ] ] commutes for all @xmath177 . \n [ def:2cat - distmult ] the 2-category @xmath20 of distributive multitensors , is defined to be the full sub-2-category of @xmath234 consisting of the @xmath634 such that @xmath16 has coproducts and @xmath122 is distributive . \n for any 2-category @xmath222 recall the 2-category @xmath643 from @xcite of monads in @xmath222 . \n another way to describe this very canonical object is that it is the 2-category of lax algebras of the identity monad on @xmath222 . \n explicitly the 2-category @xmath644 has as objects pairs @xmath645 where @xmath16 is a category and @xmath101 is a monad on @xmath16 . \n an arrow @xmath646 is a pair consisting of a functor @xmath636 and a natural transformation @xmath647 satisfying the obvious 2 axioms : these are just the `` unary '' analogues of the axioms for a lax monoidal functor written out above . \n for example , any lax monoidal functor @xmath648 as above determines a monad functor @xmath649 . a monad transformation between monad functors @xmath650 consists of a natural transformation @xmath641 satisfying the obvious axiom . \n for example a monoidal natural transformation @xmath522 as above is a monad transformation @xmath651 . \n in fact as we are interested in monads over @xmath24 , we shall work not with @xmath644 but rather with @xmath652 . \n an object @xmath645 of this latter 2-category is a category @xmath16 equipped with a functor into @xmath24 , together with a monad @xmath101 on @xmath16 which `` acts fibre - wise '' with respect to this functor . \n that is @xmath101 s object map does nt affect the underlying object set , similarly for the arrow map of @xmath101 , and the components of @xmath101 s unit and multiplication are identities on objects in the obvious sense . \n an arrow @xmath646 of @xmath652 is a pair @xmath648 as in the case of @xmath644 , with the added condition that @xmath653 s components are the identities on objects , and similarly the 2-cells of @xmath652 come with an extra identity - on - object condition . \n we shall now exhibit the 2-functor @xmath19 which on objects is given by @xmath654 . \n let @xmath655 be a lax monoidal functor between distributive lax monoidal categories . \n then for @xmath127 and @xmath261 , we define the hom map @xmath656 to be the composite of @xmath657 { \\coprod\\limits_{a = x_0, ... ,x_n = b } h\\ope\\limits_ix(x_{i-1},x_i)}=\"m \" \" l\":@<1ex>\"m\"^-{\\coprod \\psi}}\\ ] ] and @xmath658 s coproduct preservation obstruction map . \n it follows easily from the definitions that @xmath659 as defined here satisfies the axioms of a monad functor . \n moreover given a monoidal natural transformation @xmath660 , it also follows easily from the definitions that @xmath661 is a monad transformation . \n it is also straight - forward to verify that these assignments are 2-functorial .      by proposition([prop \n : pl - adjoint - char ] ) and corollary([cor : pl->copr - pres ] ) we understand objects of the image of @xmath22 and we collect this information in    [ prop : image - gamma - objects ] for @xmath16 a category with coproducts , a monad @xmath662 over @xmath24 is in the image of @xmath22 iff @xmath101 is distributive and path - like . \n moreover any such @xmath101 automatically preserves coproducts . \n one recovers the distributive multitensor @xmath122 such that @xmath663 as @xmath664 . \n since the construction @xmath405 is itself obviously 2-functorial , the arrows and 2-cells in the image of @xmath22 may also be easily characterised . \n [ prop : image - gamma-1 - 2-cells ]    1 . \n let @xmath634 and @xmath635 be distributive lax monoidal categories . \n a monad functor of the form @xmath665 is in the image of @xmath22 iff @xmath666 for some @xmath667.[gamma - char1 ] 2 . \n let @xmath668 be lax monoidal functors between distributive lax monoidal categories . a monad transformation @xmath669 is in the image of @xmath22 iff it is of the form @xmath670.[gamma - char2 ]    by definition monad functors and transformations in the image of @xmath22 have the stated properties , so we must prove the converse . given @xmath671 such that the components of @xmath653 are the identities on objects , one recovers for @xmath672 from @xmath16 , the corresponding lax monoidal functor coherence map as the hom map from @xmath26 to @xmath0 of the component @xmath673 . \n that is to say , we apply @xmath405 to the appropriate monad functors to prove ( [ gamma - char1 ] ) , and we do the same to the appropriate monad transformations to obtain ( [ gamma - char2 ] ) .    [ def : plmnd ] we denote by @xmath674 the following 2-category . \n its objects are monads @xmath675 over @xmath24 such that @xmath16 has coproducts and @xmath101 is distributive and path - like . \n its arrows are arrows @xmath676 of @xmath652 , and its 2-cells are 2-cells @xmath677 of @xmath652 .    thus from the proof of proposition([prop : image - gamma-1 - 2-cells ] ) we have    [ cor:2eq - mult - mon ] @xmath22 and @xmath405 provide a 2-equivalence @xmath678 . \n lax algebras of a 2-monad organise naturally into _ two _ different 2-categories depending on whether one takes lax or oplax algebra morphisms . \n so in particular one has the 2-category @xmath679 of lax monoidal categories , _ \n _ op__lax - monoidal functors between them and monoidal natural transformations between those . \n the coherence @xmath653 for an oplax @xmath655 goes in the other direction , and so its components look like this : @xmath680 the reader should easily be able to write down explicitly the two coherence axioms that this data must satisfy , as well as the condition that must be satisfied by a monoidal natural transformation between oplax monoidal functors . similarly there is a dual version @xmath681 of the 2-category @xmath643 of monads in a given 2-category @xmath222 discussed above @xcite . \n an arrow @xmath646 of @xmath682 consists of a functor @xmath636 and a natural transformation @xmath683 satisfying the two obvious axioms . \n an arrow of @xmath682 is called a monad opfunctor . as before @xmath684 differs from @xmath652 in that all the categories involved come with a functor into @xmath24 , and all the functors and natural transformations involved are compatible with these forgetful functors . \n we now describe the dual version of the 2-functoriality of @xmath22 discussed in sections([ssec : gamma-2-functor ] ) and ( [ ssec : gamma - image ] ) . \n when defining the one - cell map of @xmath22 in section([ssec : gamma-2-functor ] ) we were helped by the fact that the coproduct preservation obstruction went the right way : see the definition of the monad functor @xmath685 above . \n this time however we will not be so lucky , and for this reason we must restrict ourselves in the following definition to coproduct preserving oplax monoidal functors . \n [ def : opdistmult ] the 2-category @xmath686 is defined to be the locally full sub-2-category of @xmath679 consisting of the distributive lax monoidal categories , and the oplax monoidal functors @xmath648 such that @xmath658 preserves coproducts . \n we denote by @xmath687 the following 2-category . \n its objects are monads @xmath675 over @xmath24 such that @xmath16 has coproducts and @xmath101 is distributive and path - like . \n its arrows are arrows @xmath676 of @xmath684 such that @xmath658 preserves coproducts . \n its 2-cells are 2-cells @xmath677 of @xmath684 . \n we now define @xmath688 with object map @xmath654 as before , and the rest of its definition is obtained by modifying the earlier definition of @xmath22 in what should now be the obvious way . \n the proof of the following result is obtained by a similar such modification of the proof of corollary([cor:2eq - mult - mon ] ) . \n [ cor:2eq - mult - mon - dual ] @xmath22 and @xmath405 provide a 2-equivalence @xmath689      as explained in @xcite the assignment @xmath690 is in fact the object map of a strict 3-functor . just exploiting 2-functoriality here and corollaries([cor:2eq - mult - mon ] ) and ( [ cor:2eq - mult - mon - dual ] ) one immediately obtains    [ thm : monmon - distlaw ] @xmath22 and @xmath405 provide two 2-equivalences of 2-categories :    1 . \n @xmath691.[mdl1 ] 2 . \n @xmath692.[mdl2 ]    the meaning of this result is understood by understanding what the objects of the 2-categories involved are , that is to say , what monads are in each of the 2-categories @xmath20 , @xmath686 , @xmath674 and @xmath687 . \n a very beautiful observation of @xcite is that to give a monad on @xmath645 in @xmath643 is to give another monad @xmath225 on @xmath16 , together with a distributive law @xmath693 . similarly to give a monad on @xmath645 in @xmath681 is to give another monad @xmath225 on @xmath16 , together with a distributive law @xmath694 in the other direction . \n thus the 2-categories @xmath695 and @xmath696 really have the same objects : such an object being a pair of monads on the same category and a distributive law between them . \n thus both @xmath697 and @xmath698 are 2-categories whose objects are monad distributive laws between monads defined on categories of enriched graphs , with some extra conditions . \n on the other hand a monad in the 2-category @xmath234 of lax monoidal categories and lax monoidal functors is also a well - known thing , and such things are usually called _ \n monoidal monads_. similarly an opmonoidal monad @xmath101 on a monoidal category @xmath16 , that is to say a monad on @xmath16 in @xmath679 , comes with the extra data of coherence maps @xmath699 that are compatible with the monad structure . \n if for instance @xmath700 is just cartesian product , then the product obstruction maps for @xmath101 endow it with an opmonoidal structure in a unique way .    by definition \n the objects of @xmath701 are monoidal monads defined on distributive lax monoidal categories , and the objects of @xmath702 are coproduct preserving opmonoidal monads defined on distributive lax monoidal categories . \n thus the meaning of theorem([thm : monmon - distlaw ] ) is that it exhibits these kinds of monoidal and opmonoidal monads as being equivalent to certain kinds of distributive laws . \n we shall spell this out precisely in corollaries([cor : monmon - distlaw ] ) and ( [ cor : opmonmon - distlaw ] ) below . \n let @xmath634 be a lax monoidal category and @xmath101 be a monad on @xmath16 . in section([ssec \n : laxalg - const1 ] ) we saw that when @xmath101 is a monoidal monad , that is to say one has coherence maps @xmath703 making the underlying endofunctor of @xmath101 a lax monoidal functor and the unit and multiplication monoidal natural transformations , then one has another multitensor on @xmath16 given on objects by @xmath704 , and with unit and substitution given by the composites @xmath705 { tx}=\"m \" [ r(1.5 ) ] { te_1x}=\"r \" \" l\":\"m\"^-{\\eta}:\"r\"^-{tu } } } } [ r(5)d(.1 ) ] { \\xybox{\\xygraph{!{0;(2,0 ) : } { t\\ope\\limits_it\\ope\\limits_j x_{ij}}=\"l \" [ r ] { t^2\\ope\\limits_i\\ope\\limits_j x_{ij}}=\"m \" [ r ] { t\\ope\\limits_{ij}x_{ij}}=\"r \" \" l\":@<1ex>\"m\"^-{t{\\tau}e}:@<1ex>\"r\"^-{\\mu\\sigma}}}}}\\ ] ] in particular if @xmath122 is distributive and @xmath101 preserves coproducts , then this new multitensor @xmath706 is also distributive . \n if instead @xmath101 has the structure of an opmonoidal monad , with the coherences @xmath707 going in the other direction , then in the same way one can construct a new multitensor @xmath708 on @xmath16 which on objects is defined by given by @xmath709 . once again if @xmath122 is distributive and @xmath101 coproduct preserving , then @xmath708 is a distributive multitensor . \n in particular when @xmath122 is cartesian product , @xmath708 is the multitensor @xmath619 of section([ssec : induction ] ) \n .    with regards to monoidal monads , unpacking what theorem([thm : monmon - distlaw])([mdl1 ] ) says at the object level gives    [ cor : monmon - distlaw ] let @xmath634 be a distributive lax monoidal category and @xmath101 be a monad on @xmath16 . to give maps @xmath710 making @xmath101 into a monoidal monad on @xmath634 , is the same as giving a monad distributive law @xmath711 whose components are the identities on objects . \n in the case where @xmath101 preserves coproducts one may readily verify that @xmath712 as monads , and so by corollary([cor : gamma - alg - ecat ] ) one understands what the algebras of this composite monad @xmath713 are . \n [ cor : algebras - gtgammae ] if in the situation of corollary([cor : monmon - distlaw ] ) @xmath101 also preserves coproducts , then @xmath714 .    similarly , one can unpack what theorem([thm : monmon - distlaw])([mdl2 ] ) says at the object level , witness @xmath715 and use corollary([cor : gamma - alg - ecat ] ) to conclude    [ cor : opmonmon - distlaw ] let @xmath634 be a distributive lax monoidal category and @xmath101 be a coproduct preserving monad on @xmath16 . \n to give maps @xmath716 making @xmath101 into an opmonoidal monad on @xmath634 , is the same as giving a monad distributive law @xmath717 whose components are the identities on objects . \n moreover @xmath718 . \n [ ex : cheng1 ] from the inductive description of @xmath436 of section([ssec : induction ] ) and corollary([cor : opmonmon - distlaw ] ) one obtains a distibutive law @xmath719 for all @xmath0 , between monads on @xmath623 , and the composite monad @xmath720 . \n thus we have recaptured the decomposition of @xcite of the strict @xmath0-category monad into a `` distributive series of monads '' . \n pursuing the idea of the previous example , we shall now begin to recover and in some senses generalise cheng s analysis and description @xcite of the trimble definition of weak @xmath0-category .    from @xcite example(2.6 ) non - symmetric operads in the usual sense \n can be regarded as multitensors . here \n we shall identify a non - symmetric operad @xmath721 in a braided monoidal category @xmath16 , with the multitensor @xmath722 it generates . \n recall that one object @xmath122-categories for @xmath122 a non - symmetric operad are precisely algebras of the operad @xmath122 in the usual sense . if @xmath700 is cartesian product , then the projections @xmath723 are the components of a cartesian multitensor map @xmath724 . \n conversely such a cartesian multitensor map exhibits @xmath122 as an operad via @xmath725 for all @xmath40 . \n let @xmath16 be a distributive category and @xmath101 a coproduct preserving monad on @xmath16 . \n let us denote by @xmath726 a non - symmetric operad in @xmath102 . \n the `` @xmath429 '' is meant to denote the @xmath101-algebra actions , that is @xmath727 is the @xmath101-algebra structure , and so @xmath122 denotes the underlying operad in @xmath16 . since @xmath728 preserves products it is the underlying functor of a strong monoidal functor @xmath729 between lax monoidal categories . since the composites @xmath730 { te_n \\times \\prod\\limits_i tx_i}=\"m \" [ r ] { e_n \\times \\prod\\limits_itx_i}=\"r \" \" l\":@<1ex>\"m\"^-{\\textnormal{prod . \n obstn.}}:@<1ex>\"r\"^-{\\varepsilon_n \\times \\id}}\\ ] ] form the components of an opmonoidal structure for the monad @xmath101 , we find ourselves in the situation of corollary([cor : opmonmon - distlaw ] ) and so obtain    [ prop : monad - trimble ] let @xmath16 be a distributive category , @xmath101 a coproduct preserving monad on @xmath16 and @xmath726 a non - symmetric operad in @xmath102 \n . then one has a distributive law @xmath731 between monads on @xmath18 , and isomorphisms @xmath732 of categories over @xmath18 . \n this result has an operadic counterpart . \n [ prop : operad - trimble ] let @xmath16 be a lextensive category , @xmath101 a cartesian and coproduct preserving monad on @xmath16 , @xmath733 a @xmath101-operad and @xmath726 a non - symmetric operad in @xmath734 . \n then the monad @xmath735 , whose algebras by proposition([prop : monad - trimble ] ) are @xmath726-categories , has a canonical structure of a @xmath736-operad .    with @xmath737 we must exhibit a cartesian monad map @xmath738 . \n we have the cartesian multitensor map @xmath739 which exhibits the multitensor @xmath726 as a non - symmetric operad , thus @xmath740 is also a cartesian multitensor map , and since @xmath16 is lextensive @xmath22 sends this to a cartesian monad morphism . \n the required cartesian monad map is thus @xmath741 . \n recall the path - space functor @xmath742 discussed in section([ssec : enriched - graphs ] ) . to say that a non - symmetric topological operad @xmath1 acts on @xmath180 is to say that @xmath180 factors as @xmath94 { \\enrich a}=\"m \" [ r ] { \\ca g(\\top)}=\"r \" \" l\":\"m\"^-{p_a}:\"r\"^-{u^a}}\\ ] ] the main example to keep in mind is the version of the little intervals operad recalled in @xcite definition(1.1 ) . as this @xmath1 is a contractible non - symmetric operad , \n @xmath1-categories may be regarded as a model of @xmath1-infinity spaces . since @xmath180 is a right adjoint \n , @xmath743 is also a right adjoint by the dubuc adjoint triangle theorem . \n a product preserving functor @xmath744 into a distributive category , may be regarded as the underlying functor of a strong monoidal functor @xmath745 between lax monoidal categories . \n applying @xmath22 to this gives us a monad functor @xmath746 with underlying functor @xmath747 , which amounts to giving a lifting @xmath748 as indicated in the commutative diagram @xmath749 { \\enrich a}=\"tm \" [ r ] { \\enrich { qa}}=\"tr \" [ d ] { \\ca gv}=\"br \" [ l ] { \\ca g(\\top)}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tm\"^-{p_a}(:\"tr\"^-{\\overline{q}}:\"br\"^{u^{qa}},:\"bl\":\"br\"_-{\\ca g(q)}),:\"bl\"_{p})}\\ ] ] and so we have produced another product preserving functor @xmath750 where @xmath751 and @xmath752 . \n the functor @xmath748 is product preserving since @xmath753 is and @xmath754 creates products . \n the assignment @xmath755 in the case where @xmath1 is as described in @xcite definition(1.1 ) , is the inductive process lying at the heart of the trimble definition . in this definition one \n begins with the connected components functor @xmath756 and defines the category @xmath757 of `` trimble 0-categories '' to be @xmath24 . \n the induction is given by @xmath758 and so this definition constructs not only a notion of weak @xmath0-category but the product preserving @xmath759 s to be regarded as assigning the fundamental @xmath0-groupoid to a space . \n applying proposition([prop : monad - trimble ] ) to this situation produces the monad on @xmath0-globular sets whose category of algebras is @xmath760 as well as its decomposition into an iterative series of monads witnessed in @xcite section(4.2 ) . \n applying proposition([prop : operad - trimble ] ) and the inductive description of @xmath436 of section([ssec : induction ] ) exhibits these monads as @xmath0-operads . \n applied to the normalised @xmath13-operad for gray categories @xcite , the results of the section([sec : reexpress ] ) produce a lax monoidal structure @xmath122 on the category of @xmath15-globular sets whose enriched categories are exactly gray categories . for this example \n it turns out that @xmath123 is @xmath761 , and so providing a lift of @xmath122 in the sense of definition([def : lift ] ) amounts to the construction of a tensor product of @xmath15-categories whose enriched categories are gray categories , that is to say , an abstractly constructed gray tensor product . by the main result of this section theorem([thm : lift - mult ] ) , _ every _ @xmath0-multitensor has a lift which is unique given certain properties . \n while the proof of theorem([thm : lift - mult ] ) is fairly abstract , and the uniqueness has the practical effect that in the examples we never have to unpack an explicit description of the lifted multitensors provided by the theorem , we provide such an unpacking in section([ssec : explicit - lifting ] ) anyway . \n this enables us to give natural conditions when the construction of the lifted multitensor is simpler . \n doing all this requires manipulating some of the transfinite constructions that arise in monad theory , and we give a self - contained review of these in the appendix .      in appendix \n [ sec : dubuc ] we recall an explicit description , for a given monad morphism @xmath762 between accessible monads on a locally presentable category @xmath16 , of the left adjoint @xmath763 to the canonical forgetful functor @xmath764 induced by @xmath522 . the key point about @xmath763 is that it is constructed via a transfinite process involving only _ connected _ colimits in @xmath16 . \n the importance of this is underscored by    [ lem : concol - pathlike ] let @xmath16 be a category with an initial object , @xmath196 be a cocomplete category , @xmath210 be a small connected category and @xmath765\\ ] ] be a functor . \n suppose that @xmath292 sends objects of @xmath210 to normalised functors , and arrows of @xmath210 to natural transformations whose components are identities on objects . \n * then the colimit @xmath766 of @xmath292 may be chosen to be normalised.[cpl1 ]    given such a choice of @xmath767 :    * if @xmath768 is path - like for all @xmath557 , then @xmath767 is also path - like.[cpl2 ] * if @xmath768 is distributive for all @xmath557 , then @xmath767 is also distributive.[clp3 ]    colimits in @xmath769 $ ] are computed componentwise from colimits in @xmath258 and so for @xmath127 we must describe a universal cocone with components @xmath770 we demand that the @xmath771 are identities on objects . \n this is possible since the @xmath772 form the constant diagram on @xmath6 by the hypotheses on @xmath292 . \n for @xmath261 we choose an arbitrary colimit cocone @xmath773 in @xmath196 . \n one may easily verify directly that since @xmath210 is connected , the @xmath771 do indeed define a univeral cocone for all @xmath2 in order to establish ( 1 ) . \n since the properties of path - likeness and distributivity involve only colimits at the level of the homs as does the construction of @xmath767 just given , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) follow immediately since colimits commute with colimits in general . \n with these preliminaries in hand we are now ready to present the monad version of the multitensor lifting theorem , and then the lifting theorem itself . \n [ lem : mnd - lift - mult ] let @xmath16 be a locally presentable category , @xmath318 be a coproduct preserving monad on @xmath16 , @xmath225 be an accessible and normalised monad on @xmath18 , and @xmath774 be a monad morphism whose components are identities on objects . \n denote by @xmath101 the monad induced by @xmath775 . \n * one may choose @xmath763 so that @xmath101 becomes normalised . \n given such a choice of @xmath763 :    * if @xmath225 is path - like then @xmath101 is path - like . \n * if @xmath225 is distributive then @xmath101 is distributive . \n let @xmath392 be the regular cardinal such that @xmath225 preserves @xmath392-filtered colimits . to verify that @xmath776 is a normalised monad one must verify : ( i ) @xmath101 is normalised , and ( ii ) the components of the unit @xmath777 are identities on objects . \n since @xmath778 is a retraction of @xmath779 , it will then follow that the components of @xmath778 are also identities on objects . but @xmath101 is normalised iff @xmath780 is normalised , and @xmath781 , so for ( i ) it suffices to show that one can choose @xmath763 making @xmath782 normalised . \n this follows by a transfinite induction using the explicit description of @xmath782 of section([sec : dubuc ] ) and lemma([lem : concol - pathlike ] ) .    for the initial step note that @xmath783 can be chosen to be normalised , because @xmath784 is a componentwise - identity on objects natural transformation between normalised functors , since the monads @xmath225 and @xmath785 are normalised . \n thus the coequaliser defining @xmath783 is a connected colimit involving only normalised functors and componentwise - identity on objects natural transformations , and so @xmath783 can be taken to be normalised by lemma([lem : concol - pathlike ] ) . \n for the inductive steps the argument is basically the same : at each stage one is taking connected colimits of normalised functors and componentwise identity on objects natural transformations , so that by lemma([lem : concol - pathlike ] ) one stays within the subcategory of @xmath786 $ ] consisting of such functors and natural transformations . \n moreover using lemma([lem : concol - pathlike ] ) @xmath101 will be path - like if @xmath225 is .    as for ( ii ) it suffices to prove that the components of @xmath787 are identities on objects . \n writing @xmath788 for transfinite composite constructed as part of the definition of @xmath763 ( note that @xmath789 by definition ) recall from the end of section([sec : dubuc ] ) that one has a commutative square @xmath790 ^ -{\\ca g\\rho } \\ar[d]_{{\\phi}u^m } & { u^{\\ca gr } } \\ar[d]^{\\ca g(u^r)\\eta^t } \\\\ { su^{\\ca gr } } \\ar[r]_-{q } & { u^s\\phi_{!}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath791 is the 2-cell datum for @xmath318 s eilenberg - moore object , which we recall is preserved by @xmath51 . \n now @xmath791 is componentwise the identity objects since @xmath792 is and @xmath791 is a retraction of it , @xmath793 is the identity on objects by definition , and @xmath794 is by construction , so the result follows . \n recall from definition([def : lift ] ) that a _ lift _ of @xmath124 is a normal multitensor @xmath142 on @xmath141 together with an isomorphism @xmath143 which commutes with the forgetful functors into @xmath144 . \n when in addition @xmath305 is distributive , we say that it is a _ distributive lift _ of @xmath122 . \n recall from @xcite that for any category @xmath16 , the functor @xmath795 which sends a monad @xmath101 on @xmath16 to the forgetful functor @xmath103 , is fully - faithful . \n [ thm : lift - mult ] let @xmath124 be a distributive multitensor on @xmath16 a locally presentable category , and let @xmath122 be accessible in each variable . then @xmath122 has a distributive lift @xmath305 , which is unique up to isomorphism . \n write @xmath796 for the distributive multitensor on @xmath16 whose unary part is @xmath123 and whose non - unary parts are constant at @xmath151 . \n there is an obvious inclusion @xmath797 of multitensors and one clearly has @xmath798 applying lemma([lem : mnd - lift - mult ] ) with @xmath799 , @xmath800 and @xmath801 one produces a path - like , normalised and distributive monad @xmath101 on @xmath802 , because @xmath225 is accessible by proposition([prop : gamma - accessible ] ) . \n thus one has a distributive multitensor @xmath173 on @xmath141 . \n applying proposition([prop : pl - alg<->cat ] ) to @xmath173 , and corollary([cor : gamma - alg - ecat ] ) to @xmath122 , gives @xmath803 in view of the monadicity of @xmath804 . \n that is to say , @xmath173 is a distributive lift of @xmath122 . as for uniqueness suppose that @xmath142 is a distributive lift of @xmath122 . \n then by corollary([cor : gamma - alg - ecat ] ) and proposition([prop : pl - adjoint - char ] ) , @xmath805 is a distributive monad on @xmath144 and one has @xmath806 commuting with the forgetful functors into @xmath144 . by the fully - faithfulness of @xmath807 \n recalled above , one has an isomorphism @xmath808 of monads , and thus by proposition([prop : pl - adjoint - char ] ) an isomorphism @xmath809 of multitensors .    applying this result to any normalised @xmath145-operad @xmath1 , exhibits its algebras as categories enriched in the algebras of some @xmath0-operad . \n the @xmath0-operad is @xmath810 , and tensor product over which one enriches is @xmath811 . in cases \n where we already know what our tensor product ought to be , the uniqueness part of theorem([thm : lift - mult ] ) ensures that it is . \n an instance of this is    [ ex : gray ] in @xcite the normalised 3-operad @xmath23 whose algebras are gray categories was constructed . \n as we have already seen , @xmath812 is a lax monoidal structure on @xmath813 whose enriched categories are gray categories , and @xmath814 is the operad for strict 2-categories . \n note that the usual gray tensor product is symmetric monoidal closed and thus distributive . thus by theorem([thm : lift - mult ] ) @xmath815 is the gray tensor product . \n in other words , the general methods of this paper have succeeded in producing the gray tensor product of @xmath15-categories from the operad @xmath23 . \n more generally given a distributive tensor product @xmath700 on the category of algebras of an @xmath0-operad @xmath109 , and a normalised @xmath145-operad @xmath1 whose algebras are the categories enriched in @xmath109-algebras , theorem([thm : lift - mult ] ) exhibits @xmath700 as the more generally constructed @xmath811 . \n [ ex : crans ] in @xcite sjoerd crans explicitly constructed a tensor product on the category of gray - categories . \n this explicit construction was extremely complicated . \n it is possible to exhibit the crans tensor product as an instance of our general theory , by rewriting his explicit constructions as the construction of the 4-operad whose algebras are teisi in his sense . \n the multitensor @xmath122 associated to this 4-operad has @xmath123 equal to the 3-operad for gray categories . \n thus theorem([thm : lift - mult ] ) constructs a lax tensor product of gray categories whose enriched categories are teisi . since the tensor product explicitly constructed by crans is distributive , the uniqueness of part of theorem([thm : lift - mult ] ) ensures that it is indeed @xmath305 , since teisi are categories enriched in the crans tensor product by definition . \n honestly writing the details of the 4-operad of example([ex : crans ] ) is a formidable task and we have omitted this here . in the end \n though , such details will not be important , because such a tensor product ( or more properly a biclosed version thereof ) will only be really useful once it is given a conceptual definition . \n let @xmath16 be a symmetric monoidal model category which satisfies the conditions of @xcite or the monoid axiom of @xcite . in this case \n the category of pruned @xmath0-operads of @xcite can be equipped with a monoidal model structure @xcite . \n so we can speak of cofibrant @xmath0-operads in @xmath16 .    for @xmath273 \n let us fix a particular cofibrant and contractible @xmath33-operad @xmath1 . \n the algebras of @xmath816 can be called _ \n @xmath25-categories enriched in @xmath16_. up to homotopy the choice of @xmath816 is not important . \n so we can speak of _ the _ category of @xmath25-categories . \n for @xmath334 we denote by @xmath817 a cofibrant contractible @xmath15-operad in @xmath16 . \n let @xmath818 be the corresponding multitensor on @xmath18 . \n one can always choose @xmath817 in such a way that its unary part is @xmath816 . \n as in @xcite for an arbitary multitensor @xmath122 , one object @xmath122-categories are called @xmath122-monoids . \n similarly one object @xmath25-categories are called @xmath25-monoids . \n [ thm : a - infinity - app ]    1 . \n there is a distributive lift @xmath819 of @xmath109 to the category of @xmath25-categories . \n 2 .   @xmath819 restricts to give a multitensor @xmath346 on the category of @xmath25-monoids . \n the category of @xmath346-monoids is equivalent to the category of algebras of @xmath820 and therefore is quillen equivalent to the category of the algebras of the little squares operad . \n the first statement is a direct consequence of theorem([thm : lift - mult ] ) . \n the second statement follows from the fact that @xmath819 is the cartesian product on the object level . \n the last statement follows from the theorem(8.6 ) of @xcite . \n applying this result to the case @xmath821 with its folklore model structure one recovers    [ cor : js - braided ] [ joyal - street ] the category of braided monoidal categories is equivalent to the category of monoidal categories equipped with multiplication . \n the previous corollary is proved by joyal and street @xcite by a direct application of a `` categorified '' eckmann - hilton argument . \n the following analogous result for @xmath15-categories appears to be new . \n [ cor : coh - bm2c ] the category of braided monoidal @xmath15-categories is equivalent to the category of gray - monoids with multiplication . \n apply theorem([thm : a - infinity - app ] ) with @xmath822 equipped with the gray tensor product and lack s folklore model structure for 2-categories @xcite . \n thus theorem([thm : a - infinity - app ] ) should be considered as an @xmath823-generalisation of the above corollaries . \n we believe it sheds some light on the problem of defining the tensor product of @xmath25-algebras initiated by @xcite . as explained in the introduction , the negative result of @xcite shows that there is no hope to get an `` honest '' tensor product of such algebras . \n thus the multitensor @xmath346 constructed in theorem([thm : a - infinity - app ] ) is genuinely lax , and exhibits laxity as a way around the aforementioned negative result . in future work we will generalise this theorem to arbitrary dimensions . \n let us now instantiate the constructions of section([sec : dubuc ] ) to produce a more explicit description of the lifted multitensor @xmath305 . beyond mere instantiation \n this task amounts to reformulating everything in terms of hom maps which live in @xmath16 , because in our case the colimits being formed in @xmath18 at each stage of the construction are connected colimits diagrams whose morphisms are all identity on objects \n . moreover these fixed object sets are of the form @xmath154 for @xmath40 . \n +   + * notation*. we shall be manipulating sequences of data and so we describe here some notation that will be convenient . a sequence @xmath824 from some set \n will be denoted more tersely as @xmath825 leaving the length unmentioned . \n similarly a sequence of sequences @xmath826 of elements from some set will be denoted @xmath827  the variable @xmath46 ranges over @xmath164 and the variable @xmath134 ranges over @xmath132 . \n triply - nested sequences look like this @xmath828 , and so on . \n these conventions are more or less implicit already in the notation we have been using all along for multitensors . see especially section([ssec : lmc ] ) and @xcite . \n we denote by @xmath829 the ordinary sequence obtained from the @xmath244-tuply nested sequence @xmath830 by concatenation . \n in particular given a sequence @xmath825 , the set of @xmath827 such that @xmath831 is just the set of partitions of the original sequence into doubly - nested sequences , and will play an important role below . \n this is because to give the substitution maps for a multitensor @xmath122 on @xmath16 , is to give maps @xmath832 for all @xmath833 and @xmath834 from @xmath16 such that @xmath835 . \n +   + the monad map @xmath762 is taken as @xmath836 where @xmath837 is the inclusion of the unary part of the multitensor @xmath122 . \n note the notational abuse \n we regard write @xmath123 for the multitensor on @xmath16 obtained from @xmath122 by ignoring ( ie setting to constant at @xmath151 ) the non -

moore objects , to give a monad functor @xmath939 , \n is to give @xmath658 and @xmath940 such that @xmath941 . \n this follows immediately from the universal property of eilenberg - moore objects . similarly to give a monad 2-cell @xmath942 \n is to give @xmath943 and @xmath944 commuting with @xmath728 and @xmath945 . \n note that eilenberg - moore objects in @xmath58 are computed as in @xmath99 , and we shall soon apply these observations to the case @xmath946 . \n suppose we have a lax monoidal functor @xmath655 , that @xmath16 and @xmath196 are locally presentable , and that @xmath122 and @xmath292 are accessible . \n then we obtain a commutative diagram @xmath947 { \\ca gv^{e_1}}=\"tm \" [ r ] { \\ca gv}=\"tr \" [ d ] { \\ca gw}=\"br \" [ l ] { \\ca gw^{f_1}}=\"bm \" [ l ] { \\enrich f}=\"bl \" \" tl\":\"tm\":\"tr \" \" bl\":\"bm\":\"br \" \" tl\":\"bl \" \" tm\":\"bm \" \" tr\":\"br\"}\\ ] ] of forgetful functors in @xmath58 . applying the previous paragraph to the left - most square \n gives a monad morphism @xmath948 , and then applying @xmath405 to this gives the lax monoidal functor @xmath949 between the induced lifted multitensors . \n arguing similarly for monoidal transformations and monad 2-cells , one finds that the assignment @xmath950 is 2-functorial . \n let @xmath951 be an @xmath0-multitensor . in terms of the previous paragraph \n , this is the special case @xmath952 , @xmath953 , @xmath954 . \n the lifted multitensor corresponding to @xmath955 is just cartesian product for strict @xmath0-categories . \n one has a component of @xmath956 for each sequence @xmath957 of strict @xmath0-categories , and since @xmath958 as a right adjoint preserves products , this component may be regarded as a map @xmath959 of @xmath123-algebras . \n if in particular @xmath123 is itself @xmath9 and @xmath960 , then these components of @xmath956 give a canonical comparison from the lifted tensor product @xmath305 of @xmath0-categories to the cartesian product . \n for instance , when @xmath122 is the multitensor corresponding to the 3-operad for gray categories , then @xmath956 gives the well -

contractible ] applying this last result to the 3-operad @xmath23 for gray - categories , the contractibility of @xmath23 is a consequence of the fact that the canonical 2-functors from the gray to the cartesian tensor product are identity - on - object biequivalences .      continuing the discussion from section([ssec : tci ] ) , we now explain why the operads which describe \n trimble @xmath0-categories \" are contractible . \n this result appears in @xcite as theorem(4.8 ) and exhibits trimble @xmath0-categories as weak @xmath0-categories in the batanin sense . \n let us denote by @xmath1022 the set of inclusions @xmath1023 of the @xmath0-sphere into the @xmath0 disk for @xmath40 . \n as we remarked in section([ssec : enriched - graphs ] ) these may all be obtained by successively applying the reduced suspension functor @xmath126 to the inclusion of the empty space into the point . as we recalled in section([ssec : tci ] ) , a basic ingredient of the trimble definition is a version of the little intervals operad which acts on the path spaces of any space . \n a key property of this operad is that it is contractible  a topological operad @xmath1 being contractible when for each @xmath0 the unique map @xmath1024 is in @xmath1025 . \n this is equivalent to saying that the cartesian multitensor map @xmath1026 is a trivial @xmath1022-fibration . \n a useful fact about the class trivial @xmath1022-fibrations is that it gets along with the construction of path - spaces in the sense of    [ lem : tf - path - spaces ] if @xmath48 is a trivial @xmath1022-fibration then so is @xmath50 for all @xmath1027 .    to give a commutative square as on the left in @xmath1028 { x(a , b)}=\"tr \" [ d ] { y(fa , fb)}=\"br \" [ l ] { d^n}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tr\":\"br\",:\"bl\":\"br \" ) } } } & & & { \\xybox{\\xygraph{!{0;(2,0):(0,.5 ) : : } { s^n}=\"tl \" [ r ] { ( a , x , b)}=\"tr \" [ d ] { ( fa , y , fb)}=\"br \" [ l ] { d^{n{+}1}}=\"bl \" \" tl\"(:\"tr\":\"br\",:\"bl\":\"br \" ) } } } \\end{array}\\ ] ] is the same as giving a commutative square in @xmath37 as on the right in the previous display , by @xmath43 . \n the square on the right admits a diagonal filler @xmath1029 since @xmath76 is a trivial @xmath1022-fibration , and thus so does the square on the left . \n we shall write @xmath1030 for the forgetful functor for each @xmath0 . \n the relationship between trivial fibrations of spaces and of globular sets is expressed in    [ prop : pres - tf ] if @xmath48 is a trivial @xmath1022-fibration then @xmath1031 is a trivial @xmath1032-fibration . \n we proceed by induction on @xmath0 . having the right lifting property with respect to the inclusions @xmath1033 ensures that @xmath76 surjective and injective on path components , and thus is inverted by @xmath1034 . for the inductive step \n we assume that @xmath1035 sends trivial @xmath1022-fibrations to trivial @xmath998-fibrations and suppose that @xmath76 is a trivial @xmath1022-fibration . \n then so are all the maps it induces between path spaces by lemma([lem : tf - path - spaces ] ) . but from the inductive definition of @xmath1036 recalled in section([ssec \n : tci ] ) , we have @xmath1037 and so @xmath1038 is a morphism of @xmath11-globular sets which is surjective on objects ( as argued already in the @xmath332 case ) and whose hom maps are trivial @xmath998-fibrations by induction \n . thus the result follows by lemma([lem : ind - tf ] ) .    in section([ssec \n : tci ] ) we exhibited @xmath760 as the algebras of an @xmath0-operad by a straight - forward application of two abstract results \n propositions([prop : monad - trimble ] ) and ( [ prop : operad - trimble ] ) . \n we now provide a third such result relating to contractibility . \n [ prop : tf - formal ] given the data and hypotheses of proposition([prop : operad - trimble ] ) : @xmath16 is a lextensive category , @xmath101 a cartesian and coproduct preserving monad on @xmath16 , @xmath733 a @xmath101-operad and @xmath726 a non - symmetric operad in @xmath734 . \n suppose furthermore that a class @xmath965 of maps of @xmath16 is given , and that the non - symmetric operad @xmath1039 and the @xmath101-operad @xmath653 are trivial @xmath965 fibrations . \n then the @xmath736-operad @xmath1040 of proposition([prop : operad - trimble ] ) is a trivial @xmath1041-fibration .    by definition \n this monad morphism may be written as the composite @xmath1042 . since @xmath653 is a trivial @xmath965-fibration \n so is @xmath1043 by lemma([lem : basic - tf ] ) , and thus @xmath1044 is a trivial @xmath1041-fibration by proposition([prop : contractible ] ) . \n since @xmath542 is a trivial @xmath965-fibration , @xmath1045 is a trivial @xmath1041-fibration again by proposition([prop : contractible ] ) , and so the result follows since trivial fibrations compose .    starting with a contractible topological operad @xmath1 which acts on path spaces , proposition([prop : pres - tf ] ) \n ensures that @xmath1046 will be a contractible non - symmetric operad of @xmath0-globular sets . \n then proposition([prop : tf - formal ] ) may be applied to give , by induction on @xmath0 , the contractibility of the @xmath0-operad defining trimble @xmath0-categories . \n we would like to acknowledge clemens berger , richard garner , andr joyal , steve lack , joachim kock , jean -

        "abstract": "This paper develops a framework to study weak higher categories using certain combinatorial data called higher operads and multitensors. Starting from the notion that any n-dimensional categorical structure can be defined as an algebra of a suitable n-operad, the authors show how one can associate to each n-operad a lax monoidal structure (multitensor) on globular sets. They then prove a lifting theorem which provides a distributive multitensor structure on categories enriched in the algebras of these n-operads. This yields an inductive construction of desired higher-dimensional analogues of the Gray tensor product, allowing for a systematic treatment of semi-strict higher categories. Key conceptual tools include the formal theory of monads and their distributive laws, and the preservation of certain canonical colimits. As applications, the authors recover known tensor products, such as the Gray tensor product, and construct new ones, including a lax tensor product on A∞-algebras. They further show how their results relate higher-operadic approaches to other inductive approaches to higher category theory, and how contractibility of certain operads leads to definitions of weak n-categories in the Trimble style. Thus, the paper provides a unifying perspective and new conceptual insights into the theory of weak higher categories, their associated operads, and their underlying enriched structures."

        "article": "cp violation , initially observed  @xcite only in the @xmath7@xmath8 system , is one feature of the standard model ( sm ) that still defies clear theoretical understanding . the ckm picture , which describes _ all _ the _ observed _ cp violation in terms of a single phase in the quark - mixing matrix , has been vindicated by the recent measurements of @xmath9@xmath10 mixing at belle and babar  @xcite . \n cp violation is in fact one of the necessary ingredients for generating the observed excess of baryons over antibaryons in the universe @xcite . \n the amount of cp violation present in the quark sector is , however , too small to generate a baryon asymmetry of the observed level of @xmath11  @xcite . \n new sources of cp violation _ beyond _ the sm are therefore a necessity  @xcite . \n supersymmetry ( susy ) is arguably the most attractive extension of the sm , as it solves , for instance , the problem of the instability of the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale against radiative corrections . \n already the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite provides possible new sources of cp violation through additional cp - violating phases , which can not be rotated away by simple field redefinitions \n . a large number of these phases , particularly those involving sparticles of the first and to a large extent of the second generation , are severely constrained by measurements of the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of the electron , muon , neutron as well as @xmath12hg and @xmath13tl \n . however , these constraints are model - dependent . \n it has been demonstrated @xcite that cancellations among different diagrams allow certain combinations of these phases to be large in a general mssm . \n furthermore , if the sfermions of the first two generations are sufficiently heavy , above the 1 tev range , the edm constraints on the phase of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath14 , in general constrained to @xmath15 , get weaker ; the sfermions of the third generation can still be light . non - vanishing phases of @xmath16 and/or the trilinear scalar couplings @xmath17 can induce explicit cp violation in the higgs sector via loop corrections @xcite . \n though these phases generate edms independently of the first two generations of sfermions , the edms are suppressed by the mass scale of the two heavy higgses @xcite . for a thorough discussion of the edms see @xcite and references therein . \n the above mentioned phases can also have a significant influence on the higgs production rates in the gluon fusion mode at the tevatron and the lhc @xcite . \n mssm cp phases can hence change the higgs phenomenology at colliders quite substantially . \n all this makes the mssm with cp - violating phases a very attractive proposition . \n it has therefore been the subject of many recent investigations , studying the implications of these phases on neutralino / chargino production and decay @xcite , on the third generation of sfermions @xcite , as well as the neutral @xcite and charged @xcite higgs sector . \n various cp - even and cp - odd ( t - odd ) observables , which can give information on these phases , have been identified . \n it is interesting to note that cp - even observables such as masses , branching ratios , cross sections , etc . \n , often afford more precise probes thanks to the larger magnitude of the effects . for direct evidence of cp violation , however , cp - odd / t - odd observables as discussed e.g.  in @xcite have to be measured . \n the latest study of the @xmath18 sector in @xcite demonstrates that it may be possible to determine the real and imaginary parts of @xmath19 to a precision of 23% from a fit of the mssm lagrange parameters to masses , cross sections and branching ratios at a future @xmath20 linear collider ( lc ) . \n this requires that both the @xmath21 , @xmath22 mass eigenstates can be produced at the lc and the branching ratios measured with high precision . in the @xmath23 sector @xcite the precision on @xmath24 is worse , around 1020% for low @xmath25 and about 37% for large @xmath25 .    in this paper \n , we show that the longitudinal polarization of fermions produced in sfermion decays , i.e.  @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 a third generation ( s)quark or ( s)lepton , can also be used as a probe of cp phases \n . the fermion polarization can give complementary information to the decay branching ratios and will in particular be useful if the branching ratios can not be measured with high enough precision or if one decay channel dominates . \n the average polarization of fermions produced in sfermion decays carries information on the @xmath29@xmath30 mixing as well as on the gaugino  higgsino mixing @xcite . \n the polarizations that can be measured are those of top and tau ; both can be inferred from the decay lepton distributions . \n it is its large mass that causes the @xmath31 to decay before hadronization and thus the decay products can carry information about its polarization . \n for taus , also the energy distribution of the decay pions can be used . \n the polarization of the decay fermions has been used for studies of mssm parameter determination in the cp - conserving case in @xcite . for the cp - violating case \n , the phase dependence of the longitudinal fermion polarization has been mentioned in @xcite . \n we extend these studies by discussing in detail the sensitivity of the fermion polarization to cp - violating phases in the mssm . \n the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we summarize our notation for the description of the sfermion , neutralino and chargino systems in the mssm with cp violation . in section  3 , we discuss fermion polarization in sfermion decays to neutralinos , @xmath32 with @xmath33 . \n we present numerical results on the polarization as a function of different mssm parameters and discuss the sensitivity to cp - violating phases in the sfermion and neutralino sectors . in section \n 4 we perform an analogous analysis for @xmath34 decays . in section  5 \n we summarize the results and present our conclusions . \n ignoring intergenerational mixing , the sfermion mass matrices can be written as a series of @xmath35 matrices , each of which describes sfermions of a specific flavour : @xmath36 with @xmath37    { m_{\\sf_{r}}}^2 & = & m^2_{\\ti r }      + e_f\\,m_z^2 \\cos 2\\b\\,\\sin^2\\t_w + m_f^2 , \\\\[1 mm ]    a_f & = & a_f - \\mu^*\\ , \\ { \\cot\\b , \\tan\\b \\ }            = |a_f|\\ , e^{i\\phsf } \\ , ,    \\label{eq : aq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath38up , down@xmath39-type sfermions ; @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the mass , electric charge and the third component of the weak isospin of the partner fermion , respectively ; @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are soft susy - breaking parameters for each family , and @xmath16 is the higgsino mass parameter ; @xmath45 and @xmath16 can have complex phases : @xmath46 and @xmath47 . + according to eq . \n , @xmath48 is diagonalized by a unitary rotation matrix @xmath49 . \n the weak eigenstates @xmath50 and @xmath51 are thus related to their mass eigenstates @xmath52 and @xmath53 by @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 the sfermion mixing angle and phase . since the off - diagonal element of @xmath48 is proportional to @xmath40 , this mixing is mostly relevant to the third generation , @xmath57 , on which we concentrate in the following . \n the mass eigenvalues are given by @xmath58 by convention , we choose @xmath52 to be the lighter mass eigenstate , @xmath59 . \n notice also that @xmath60 . for the mixing angle @xmath55 we choose @xmath61 which places @xmath55 in the 2nd quadrant of the unit circle . \n the @xmath62@xmath63 mixing is large if @xmath64 , with @xmath65 if @xmath66 and @xmath67 if @xmath68 . \n moreover , we see that the phase dependence of @xmath69 and @xmath49 is determined by @xmath70 . \n this dependence is strongest if @xmath71 . \n this issue will be discussed in more detail in the numerical analyses of sections  3 and 4 .      in the basis @xmath72 the neutralino mass matrix is : @xmath73    the gaugino mass parameters @xmath74 and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath16 can in principle all be complex . \n the phase of @xmath75 can be rotated away , which leaves us with two phases in this sector : @xmath76 , the phase of @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , the phase of @xmath16 . \n + the matrix of eq . \n is diagonalized by the unitary mixing matrix @xmath79 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , are the ( non - negative ) masses of the physical neutralino states . \n we choose the ordering @xmath83 . a concise discussion of the neutralino sector with complex phases can be found in @xcite . \n the chargino mass matrix is : @xmath84 it is diagonalized by the two unitary matrices @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 where @xmath88 are the masses of the physical chargino states with @xmath89 . \n the sfermion interaction with neutralinos is ( @xmath91 ; @xmath82 ) @xmath92 where @xmath93 the @xmath94 and @xmath95 couplings are @xmath96 for stops and sbottoms , and @xmath97 for staus , with the yukawa couplings @xmath98 given by @xmath99    the gaugino interaction conserves the helicity of the sfermion while the higgsino interaction flips it . in the limit @xmath100 , the average polarization of the fermion coming from the @xmath101 decay \n can therefore be calculated as @xcite @xmath102    using eqs .  , and as well as @xmath103 \n , we obtain , for the @xmath104 decay ( omitting the overall factor @xmath105 and dropping the sfermion and neutralino indices for simplicity ) : @xmath106 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that the phase dependence of @xmath107 is the largest for maximal sfermion mixing ( @xmath108 ) and if the neutralino has both sizeable gaugino and higgsino components . \n it is , moreover , enhanced if the yukawa coupling @xmath98 is large . \n furthermore , @xmath107 is sensitive to cp violation even if just one phase , in either the neutralino or the sfermion sector , is non - zero . in particular , if only @xmath45 and thus only the sfermion mixing matrix has a non - zero phase , the phase - dependent term becomes @xmath109 if , on the other hand , only @xmath76 is non - zero we get @xmath110\\,\\sin 2\\t \\,.\\ ] ]    the polarization @xmath111 , eq . \n , depends only on couplings but not on masses . for the numerical analysis we therefore use @xmath77 , @xmath75 , @xmath16 , @xmath112 , @xmath55 and @xmath113 as input parameters , assuming @xmath114 to satisfy edm constraints more easily : assuming cancellations for the 1-loop contributions and the cp - odd higgs mass parameter @xmath115  gev , 1-loop and 2-loop contributions to the electron edm ( eedm ) , as well as their sum , stay below the experimental limit . \n we use the formulae of @xcite for the 2-loop contributions . in order not to vary too many parameters , we use , \n moreover , the gut relation @xmath116 and choose @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( large but not maximal mixing ) throughout this section . \n the free parameters in our analysis are thus @xmath75 , @xmath119 , and the phases @xmath76 , @xmath113 . \n before we present the numerical results , a comment is in order : cp violation in the neutralino sector is determined by the phases of @xmath77 and @xmath16 , while @xmath113 originates from relative phases of @xmath45 and @xmath16 . for stops the mixing \n is dominated by @xmath19 , while for sbottoms and staus it is dominated by @xmath120 ; quite generally we have @xmath121 unless @xmath122 , and @xmath123 unless @xmath124 . \n more precisely , @xmath125 for @xmath126 , any @xmath113 can be reached by an appropriate choice of @xmath127 , independent of @xmath128 . for @xmath129 , however , @xmath113 is restricted by @xmath128 . in the special case of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , @xmath132 . in the stop sector \n this is not a problem since @xmath133 can in general be easily achieved . for sbottoms and staus \n , choosing @xmath134 freely leads , however , to quite large @xmath135 , which may in some cases create problems with charge- or colour - breaking minima . \n ( 148,66 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 30,0 ) ( 104,0 ) ( -2,37 ) ( 72,37 ) ( -2,64 ) ( 72,64 ) ( 16,14 ) ( 90,14 )    ( 148,72 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 30,0 ) ( 104,0 ) ( -2,37 ) ( 72,37 ) ( -2,64 ) ( 72,64 ) ( 16,14 ) ( 110,14 )    shows the average tau polarization in @xmath136 decays as functions of @xmath75 and @xmath119 for @xmath117 , @xmath137 and various choices of @xmath76 and @xmath138 . \n the lower limits of @xmath75 and @xmath119 are given by the lep2 constraint of @xmath139  gev @xcite , which automatically takes care of all other lep constraints on the gaugino \n higgsino sector . \n as can be seen , @xmath140 is quite sensitive to cp phases for @xmath141 , that is if the @xmath142 has a sizeable higgsino component . \n analogously , shows the average top polarization in @xmath143 decays . \n we observe again a strong dependence on the cp phases if the neutralino has a sizeable higgsino component . unlike the case of @xmath140 , for @xmath144 \n the dependence is still significant when @xmath145 . \n we also note that some phase combinations lead to very similar polarizations , e.g.  @xmath146 and @xmath147 . at a future @xmath20 linear collider ( lc ) \n , one expects to be able to measure the tau polarization to about 35% and the top polarization to about 10% @xcite . \n we see from figs . \n [ fig : ptau_m2mu ] and [ fig : ptop_m2mu ] that the effects of cp - violating phases may well be visible in @xmath144 and/or @xmath140 , provided @xmath16 is not too large . \n we next choose specific values of @xmath75 and @xmath119 to discuss the phase dependences in more detail . a shows \n @xmath140 as a function of @xmath76 , for @xmath148  gev , @xmath149  gev and @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 . since for fixed @xmath75 and @xmath119 the @xmath142 mass changes with @xmath76 , we show in addition in b @xmath140 as a function of @xmath154 for various values of @xmath76 , with @xmath149  gev and @xmath75 adjusted such that @xmath155  gev . \n @xmath140 varies over a large range depending on @xmath76 and @xmath154 ; if the neutralino mass parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath156 are known , @xmath140 can hence be used as a sensitive probe of these phases ( although additional information will be necessary to resolve ambiguities and actually determine the various phases ) . at a lc \n , the parameters of the neutralino / chargino sector and also sfermion masses and mixing angles can be determined very precisely , exploiting tunable beam energy and beam polarization @xcite . \n the actual precision depends of course on the specific scenario . to illustrate the influence of uncertainties in the knowledge of the model parameters , we take the case of @xmath148  gev , @xmath149  gev and vanishing phases as reference point and \n assume that the following precisions can be achieved : @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 . \n varying the parameters within this range around the reference point leads to @xmath161 at @xmath150 , which is indicated as an error bar in b. ( the 35% uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath162 is comparatively negligible ) . \n we conclude that in our particular scenario , if no phase has been observed in the neutralino / chargino sector , a measurement of @xmath140 would be sensitive to @xmath163 . \n if @xmath25 can be measured to @xmath164 , this improves to @xmath165 and @xmath166 . according to \n , a measurement of a non - zero @xmath167 implies a lower limit on @xmath168 ; in our example where @xmath131 , @xmath169  gev ( 1  tev ) for @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) . increasing the precision in @xmath172 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 from 0.5% to 0.1% \n barely improves these limits . \n ( 148,72 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 36,-1 ) ( 109,-1 ) ( -2,37 ) ( 72,37 ) ( -2,64 ) ( 72,64 )    ( 148,72 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 36,-1 ) ( 108,-1 ) ( -2,37 ) ( 72,37 ) ( -2,64 ) ( 72,64 )    we perform a similar analysis for @xmath144 , using @xmath174  gev and @xmath175  gev as reference point . \n the results are shown in a , b in analogy to a , b . again a high sensitivity to both @xmath76 and @xmath176 is observed . for the case of vanishing phases \n , we get @xmath177 . \n a variation of the parameters around the reference point as above ( with @xmath178 ) leads to a parametric uncertainty of @xmath179 . adding the experimental resolution @xmath180 in quadrature gives @xmath181 at @xmath182 , indicated as an error bar in b. we see that in this scenario @xmath144 would be sensitive to @xmath183 . \n if @xmath184 can be measured to @xmath185 this improves to @xmath186 ( @xmath187 ) and @xmath188 ; if @xmath77 , @xmath75 , @xmath119 can be measured to 0.1% and @xmath25 to @xmath189 , @xmath190 becomes negligible with respect to the experimental resolution of @xmath191 . \n since @xmath192 , a measurement of @xmath144 can be used to derive information on @xmath19 . in particular , \n if both mass eigenstates are known , @xmath19 is given by @xmath193 an analogous relation with @xmath194 holds for @xmath195 , although the precision on @xmath24 is in general much worse than on @xmath19 . in this context note \n that @xmath111 can also be useful to resolve the sign ambiguity in the @xmath196 determination from cross section measurements @xcite in the cp - conserving case . \n this corresponds to distinguishing the cases @xmath197 and @xmath198 . \n even though we have presented results of our analysis for @xmath199 , chosen in order to satisfy the edm constraints without having to appeal to cancellations , we have also investigated the case of a non - zero @xmath128 . \n we found that a non - zero @xmath128 shifts the curves in [fig : ptop_phases ] but does not cause a qualitative change of the results . \n ( 148,72 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 38,-1 ) ( 112,-1 ) ( -2,37 ) ( 72,37 ) ( -2,64 ) ( 72,64 )    last but not least we note that giving up the gut relation between @xmath200 and @xmath75 changes the picture completely , as the pattern of gaugino  higgsino mixing is strongly affected @xcite . \n this is illustrated in , where we plot @xmath140 and @xmath144 as functions of @xmath201 for @xmath202  gev , @xmath203  gev and the other parameters as in and [ fig : ptop_m2mu ] . \n a detailed study of the implications of non - universal gaugino masses will be presented elsewhere . \n + _ to sum up , _ both @xmath144 and @xmath140 can vary over a large range depending on @xmath76 and @xmath204 ( and also @xmath128 , though we did not discuss this case explicitly ) and may thus be used as sensitive probes of these phases . \n to this aim , however , the neutralino mass parameters , @xmath25 and the sfermion mixing angles need to be known . given the complexity of the problem , a combined fit of all available data seems to be the most convenient method for the extraction of the mssm parameters . \n the sfermion interaction with charginos is ( @xmath206 ) @xmath207 where @xmath208 ( @xmath209 ) stands for up - type ( s)quark and ( s)neutrinos , and @xmath210 ( @xmath211 ) stands for down - type ( s)quark and charged ( s)leptons . \n the couplings @xmath212 and @xmath213 are @xmath214 for stops and sbottoms and @xmath215 for staus and sneutrinos . \n analogous to the decay into a neutralino , eq . \n , the average polarization of the fermion coming from the @xmath216 decay is given by @xmath217    since only top and tau polarizations are measurable , we only discuss @xmath218 and @xmath219 decays . \n the latter case is especially simple because @xmath220 depends only on the parameters of the chargino sector : @xmath221 a measurement of @xmath220 may hence be useful to supplement the chargino parameter determination . \n however , the dependence of @xmath222 on @xmath199 turns out to be very small , the effects being in general well below 1% ( i.e. @xmath223 ) . only for the decay into the heavier chargino \n , the effect of a non - zero phase is severely restricted by the non - observation of the eedm . ] \n may be sizeable . \n as an example , shows the differences in @xmath224 between @xmath131 and @xmath225 in the @xmath226 plane for @xmath227  gev . \n @xmath228 can go up to @xmath229 . \n however , it requires quite heavy sneutrinos for this decay to be kinematically allowed . \n moreover , the measurement of @xmath224 will be diluted by @xmath230 decays . \n +    ( 70,74 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 27,-3 ) ( -2,71 ) ( 7,60 ) ( 36,60 ) ( 22,50 ) ( 24,38 ) ( 28,26.5 ) ( 34,18 )    let us now turn to top polarization in @xmath218 decays . for @xmath231 decays , we have @xmath232 \\cos\\varphi         + { { \\cal i}m\\ , } [ u_{j1}^ { } u_{j2}^ { * } ] \\sin\\varphi ) \\ , . \n \\label{eq : sbot1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath233 decays , the corresponding expression is given by the rhs of with @xmath234 , @xmath235 interchanged , and a change in sign of the term @xmath236 . \n we see that the phase dependence of @xmath237 is proportional to @xmath238 and the amount of gaugino  higgsino mixing of the charginos ; it will therefore be largest for @xmath239 , @xmath240 and large @xmath112 . again \n , there is a non - zero effect even if there is just one phase in either the sbottom or chargino sector . \n note , however , that the only cp phase in the chargino sector is @xmath128 , which also enters the sfermion mass matrices . \n complex @xmath85 and @xmath86 hence imply @xmath241 . \n more precisely , @xmath242 for medium and large @xmath112 , and thus @xmath243 unless @xmath244 ; see eq .   and the related discussion . \n for the sake of a general discussion of the phase dependence of @xmath237 ( and since @xmath245 is still a free parameter ) , we nevertheless use @xmath199 and @xmath246 as independent input parameters .    shows the average top polarization in @xmath247 decays as a function of @xmath119 for @xmath248  gev , @xmath249 and 30 , and various combinations of @xmath199 and @xmath246 . \n here we have fixed @xmath250 , since from renormalization - group running one expects @xmath251 . as in the previous section , we find large effects from cp - violating phases if the @xmath252 has a sizeable higgsino component ; as expected , these effects are enhanced for large @xmath25 . \n the results stay the same if both @xmath199 and @xmath246 change their signs . moreover , @xmath253 . if @xmath199 and @xmath246 have the same sign , the difference in @xmath237 from the case of vanishing phases is larger than if they have opposite signs . \n in particular , we find @xmath254 over large regions of the parameter space . with an experimental resolution of the top polarization of about 10% \n this implies that in many cases @xmath255 can not be distinguished from @xmath256 by measurement of @xmath237 . \n furthermore , the value of @xmath237 is quite sensitive to the running @xmath257 quark mass , which enters the bottom yukawa coupling of eq .   and is subject to possibly large susy loop corrections . for the lines in we have used @xmath258  gev \n the grey bands show the range of @xmath237 when @xmath259 is varied between 2.5 and 4.5 gev . \n as can be seen , the uncertainty in @xmath259  more precisely in @xmath260  tends to wash out small effects of cp - violating phases , specially in the case of large @xmath25 . \n ( 148,72 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 32,-1 ) ( 104,-1 ) ( -2,37 ) ( 72,37 ) ( -2,64 ) ( 72,64 ) ( 30,67 ) ( 102,67 )    ( 148,72 ) ( 5,3.3 ) ( 81,2 ) ( 33,-1 ) ( 112,-1 ) ( -4,37 ) ( 73,37 ) ( -4,63 ) ( 73,63 ) ( 14,68 ) ( 92,68 )    in order to see what information can be extracted from a @xmath237 measurement , we pick two values of @xmath119 from a ;

@xmath82 ; @xmath311 ) . \n this polarization is considered as a useful tool for the mssm parameter determination @xcite .    in decays into charginos , \n the polarization depends on the phase of @xmath16 . \n since this dependence is weak in the case of @xmath219 , @xmath220 does not provide a promising probe of cp phases ( on the other hand , exactly this feature can make @xmath220 useful for consistency tests of gaugino  higgsino mixing ) \n . in @xmath312 decays , the dependence on @xmath199 can be rather large ; in addition , also the phase of the sbottom - mixing matrix plays a role . if @xmath313 , @xmath314 . \n we found that this case can be difficult to distinguish from the cp - conserving case by measuring @xmath315 . if , however , a deviation from @xmath316 is observed , these phases can be constrained and also limits on @xmath245 can be derived . \n the decays @xmath317 and @xmath318 provide a more effective probe of cp violation because an additional phase , the phase of @xmath77 , contributes . \n we found that cp phases can have a significant effect on the top and tau polarizations , especially if the involved neutralino has a sizeable higgsino component . \n if the parameters of the neutralino sector can be measured precisely , e.g.  in @xmath20 annihilation with polarized beams , @xmath319 and @xmath320 can be useful for the determination of cp phases . \n in particular , since @xmath192 unless @xmath119 is very large , a measurement of @xmath144 can give information on @xmath19 . \n in this respect it is important to note that ( for fixed masses ) the sfermion production cross sections do not depend on cp phases . in the sfermion sector \n , these can be manifest in branching ratios as discussed in @xcite , polarization of the decay fermions as discussed in this paper , and cp - odd asymmetries . \n branching ratios are in general rather difficult to measure with high precision . \n the information that can be gained from branching ratios is also limited if one decay channel dominates , e.g. @xmath136 in case of a light stau . \n this makes the polarization of the decay fermions a very interesting possibility to explore cp phases . \n last but not least we note that the computations in this paper , leading to effects of a few percent , have been performed at tree level \n . the influence of radiative corrections @xcite can be of comparable size and will therefore have to be taken into account for precision analyses . \n a measurement of the cp phases in the sfermion/@xmath321 sector will also complement cp studies of the higgs sector @xcite , since in the mssm higgs - sector cp violation is generated through quantum corrections @xcite . \n last but not least we emphazise that , since the effects can be large , the possibility of cp violation should be taken into account in precision susy parameter analyses , especially in a general analysis project as envisaged in @xcite . \n t.g . acknowledges the financial support of the institut fr hochenergiephysik in vienna and the cern theory division . \n r.g . wishes to thank the cern theory division and lapth for hospitality and financial support , where this work was completed . \n thanks the centre for high energy physics in bangalore for hospitality and financial support . \n rg wishes to acknowledge the partial support of the department of science and technology , india , under project number sp / s2/k-01/2000-ii . \n the sm constants used in the numerical analysis are : @xmath322          a.  d.  sakharov , pisma zh . \n teor .  fiz . \n * 5 * ( 1967 ) 32 , jetp lett . 6 , 24 ( 1967 ) . for a recent summary , \n see a.  d.  dolgov , hep - ph/0211260 . c.  l.  bennett _ et al . \n _ , astrophys . \n j.  suppl .   * 148 * , 1 ( 2003 ) [ astro - ph/0302207 ] . for a review , see e.g. m.  dine and a.  kusenko , rev . \n phys .   * 76 * , 1 ( 2004 ) [ hep - ph/0303065 ] . \n see , e.g.h . \n e.  haber and g.  l.  kane , phys . \n rept .   * 117 * ( 1985 ) 75 . t.  ibrahim and p.  nath , phys . \n b * 418 * , 98 ( 1998 ) [ hep - ph/9707409 ] ;

        "abstract": "This paper explores how CP-violating phases in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model affect fermion polarization in sfermion decays into neutralinos and charginos. Such fermion polarizations, particularly of the top and tau, can be sensitive probes of CP phases if the involved neutralinos or charginos mix strongly between gaugino and higgsino states. The study demonstrates that measuring these polarizations, alongside other observables such as masses and branching ratios, could help constrain CP-violating parameters. The authors emphasize that, for precision determinations, radiative corrections and carefully combined analyses of various decay channels and collider measurements will be necessary to extract CP phases successfully."

        "article": "the variability of ex lup was discovered by miss e. janssen in 1944 while examining spectral plates at the harvard observatory ( mclaughlin 1946 ) . \n herbig ( 1950 ) first pointed out the similarity of ex lupi s spectral characteristics and t tauri stars with strong emission lines of h , caii , feii , and hei . in one of the spectrograms he obtained in 1949/1950 \n the h and caii lines clearly show an inverse p cygni profile . \n herbig ( 1977a ) assigned the spectral type of m0:ev using the 5850 - 6700  range . \n photographic and visual light - curves covering a century of observations revealed the irregular photometric behaviour of the star ( mclaughlin 1946 , bateson et al . \n outbursts of up to 5 magnitudes may occur , but the star normally shows only small amplitude irregular variations . \n the most prominent events last about one year . \n the typical recurrence time scale of outbursts is of the order of a decade . \n + up to now there are only a few other stars known with comparable outburst characteristics ( herbig 1989 ) . \n this small group of very active t tauri stars has been called exors or sometimes sub - fuors . both names point to an affinity to the so called fu orionis stars ( fuors ) . \n fuors are another group of young low mass stars with even stronger outbursts lasting for decades . unlike exors , during an outburst fuor spectra turn from t tauri characteristics to that of much earlier \n f or g supergiants lacking strong line emission ( herbig 1977b ) . \n fuors have high mass accretion rates ( @xmath0,hartmann 1991 ) and strong winds ( e.g. calvet et al . 1993 ) and they may be the source that drive herbig - haro flows ( reipurth 1989 ) . \n + exors are little studied , but potentially of great interest because they may represent an intermediate level of activity between ordinary active t tauri stars and full blown fu orionis eruptions . in order to cast further light on this interpretation \n , we have followed some exors spectroscopically and photometrically during 1993 and 1994 . \n the star ex lup has been at a low level of activity during the 1980 s . in the early 1990 s this situation changed and the star became active ( jones et al . \n 1993 , hughes et al . \n amateur observations ( variable star section of the royal astronomical society of new zealand , unpublished ) indicated a strong brightening in february / march 1994 . \n patten ( 1994 ) reports some follow - up photometric and low resolution spectroscopic observations of the same outburst . \n + in this paper we present part of our optical observations of ex lup taken at eso , la silla . \n we concentrate on data obtained during the outburst in march 1994 and include some spectroscopic observations carried out in august 1994 when the star only exhibited post - outburst low level activity . \n a complete presentation of our data will appear in a future paper . \n differential ccd photometry has been carried out at the 0.9m - dutch and the 1.54m - danish telescopes . \n this photometry was later calibrated with respect to standard stars including extinction and colour corrections . \n all reductions have been made with the apphot package in iraf . \n typical errors ( 1@xmath1 ) in the differential photometry are @xmath2b=0.005 , @xmath2v=0.004 , @xmath2r=0.004 whereas the absolute magnitude scale itself is accurate to about 0.01 in all three colours . \n + the resulting lightcurves in b , v , and r are presented in fig . \n 1 . the maximum occurred between february 25 and march 4 ( herbig , priv . \n the fading tail of the eruption can be described as an exponential decline with small fluctuations superimposed . \n variability of more than 0.1mag is present on timescales of less than one hour ( e.g. march 6.3 , see also patten 1994 ) . \n figure 2 displays the colour change in b - v during the decline . \n the star clearly becomes redder when fading . \n for comparison we have included some points close to minimum light taken from the literature . \n the outburst amplitude was about @xmath2v=2.0mag and @xmath2b=2.6mag  . \n spectroscopic observations in the blue spectral range were carried out during the first few nights in march 1994 on the eso-1.52 m telescope using the boller & chivens spectrograph at 1.2 resolution . \n after the decline of ex lup we obtained post - outburst spectra in the same wavelength region at resolutions of 1.5 and 12 at the 3.5m - ntt with emmi in august 1994 . \n all spectra have been reduced with the ctioslit package in iraf . \n observations of spectrophotometric standards and nightly extinction curves allowed for a flux calibration . \n + in fig.3 we present two spectra of ex lup : one close to the outburst maximum and the other at low activity almost half a year after the eruption . some of the emission lines of h , caii , feii , hei , and heii are indicated . under the assumption that the total light can be decomposed into an underlying t tauri star photosphere , a continuum source , and superimposed emission lines , we now discuss the different spectral components and their variability .      a powerful method to determine \n the continuum excess emission is to determine the veiling by comparison with spectra of stars of the same spectral type and luminosity class but lacking any disk signature ( hartigan et al . \n 1989 , 1991 ) . \n the accuracy of the veiling determination decreases rapidly when the emission component exceeds the photospheric luminosity . in the case of ex lup during its eruption we therefore did not intend to derive the veiling and the true excess emission spectrum by comparison with spectral type standards , but we could examine the spectral variability caused by the outburst . + \n no photospheric absorption features are seen during the outburst ( upper spectrum in fig.3 ) but they appear in the post - outburst spectrum . \n thus the major source of variability presumably is a featureless continuum . \n therefore , a difference spectrum between outburst and post - outburst spectra should be a good measure of the continuum emission spectrum . in fig . \n 4 we plot two difference spectra at low resolution . \n the first shows the difference between an outburst ( march 3 ) and a post - outburst ( august 16 ) spectrum , while the second shows the difference between two post - outburst ( august 18 and 16 ) spectra which displays normal low - level variability . \n the continuum emission spectrum displaying the normal low - level activity is bluer than the continuum emission present during outburst . \n the most intriguing features in the spectra of ex lup are strong emission lines . \n the balmer series can be seen up to h15 especially during times of minimum activity . \n equivalent widths and fluxes of individual lines are given in table 1 . \n essentially all strong emission lines have increasing fluxes as the star brightens . \n however due to the steep rise of the continuum the equivalent widths decrease , which is also evident in the data from patten ( 1994 ) at h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , and h@xmath5 during the maximum . \n obviously the caii lines have a larger flux amplification during the outburst than the balmer lines . \n there is some indication that line fluxes of metals do not increase while the star goes into outburst ( cai , feii , srii ) . \n +    lrrrr & & & & + identification & w@xmath6 & w@xmath7 & flux@xmath8 & flux@xmath9 + &  &  & @xmath10 & @xmath10 + & & & & + & & & & + h11 3771 & -1.0 & -4.2 & 16 & 6 + h10 3798 & -1.5 & -7.0 & 25 & 9 + h 9 3835 & -1.2 & -12.1 & 20 & 16 + h 8 3889 & -2.7 & -13.0 & 44 & 18 + sii 3906 & -0.2 & -0.8 & 3 & 1 + caii 3934 & -7.7 & -12.0 & 123 & 15 +    .comparison of selected emission lines at different levels of activity . \n equivalent widths and line fluxes during the outburst measured on march 3 ( @xmath8 ) and in the post -

outburst difference spectrum corresponds to a velocity of @xmath13 km / s . \n photospheric features of the underlying t tauri star can be seen only in the post - outburst spectra . \n figure 6 shows the region around cai 4227 , which is the strongest stellar absorption line , in two post - outburst spectra . \n the difference of these two spectra no longer exhibits the absorption line , and the change of total flux by about 40% is therefore due to continuum emission rather than photospheric variability . \n + the photospheric lines of the t tauri star are veiled , even at minimum brightness . \n the superimposed emission line spectrum additionally fills in many absorption lines . \n the measurement of the veiling is therefore rather difficult . \n we find a good fit to the observed strength of absorption lines by introducing a flat continuum emission equal to the photospheric continuum of the underlying star ( veiling r=1 , comparison with hd  202560 , spectral type m0v ) at 4200  when the brightness of ex lup is v=13.0 . \n the outburst of ex lup can be understood in terms of a mass accretion event causing increased continuum emission in a hot region close to the surface of the star where the infalling matter finally releases its kinetic energy . \n the total light of the photosphere and the hot region becomes dominated by the latter and therefore it is much bluer during the outburst . \n furthermore all photospheric lines are heavily veiled ( assuming that r=1 at minimum light then the veiling during outburst would be r@xmath1420 ) . \n the different slope of the continuum emission in the outburst compared to the post - outburst ( see fig.4 ) indicates that the hot region is _ cooler _ during outburst ( assuming no change in extinction due to circumstellar matter ) . \n this interpretation then implies a dramatic expansion of the hot region in order to account for the observed rise in luminosity during the outburst . \n + the inverse p cygni profiles of many emission lines prove the infall motion of accreted material . \n the velocity derived from the redward displacement of the absorption component of these lines are of the order of 300 km / s and therefore much higher than those assumed in the classical boundary layer model for t tauri stars ( lynden - bell & pringle , 1974 ) . however , these high infall velocities may result from magnetospherically mediated disk accretion ( camenzind 1990 , knigl 1991 , hartmann et al . \n high resolution studies of classical t tauri stars have revealed a large fraction of stars exhibiting inverse p cygni structures ( e.g. appenzeller 1977 , edwards et al . , 1994 ) . \n the usual low level variability might be caused by geometrical effects during the rotation of the star . \n the more dramatic outbursts could be attributed to episodic changes in the magnetosphere , resulting in more extended infall flows of circumstellar material onto the star . \n + _ acknowledgements : _ we thank g.herbig for alerting us to the outburst of ex lup in early march 1994 \n . also we are grateful to the following observers for kindly providing part of their observing time : t.abbott , j.f.claeskens , d.de  winter , c.flynn , h.jerjen , a.manchado , f.patat , n.robichon , p.stein . \n tl & wb were supported by student fellowships of the european southern observatory . \n wb acknowledges support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) under grant yo 5/16 -

        "abstract": "This study examines the 1994 outburst of the pre-main sequence star EX Lupi, a member of the small class of variable young stars known as EXors. These objects exhibit irregular, often large-amplitude brightness changes associated with increased mass accretion. By comparing optical spectra and photometric measurements during and after EX Lupi’s brightening event, the authors find that a strong, featureless continuum emerges during outbursts, veiling the star’s normal photospheric absorption lines. Inverse P Cygni profiles indicate infalling matter at high velocities, supporting a magnetospheric accretion scenario. EX Lupi may represent an intermediate stage between normal T Tauri stars and FU Orionis objects."

        "article": "the liquid - gas ( lg ) phase transition in nuclear matter remains illusive and a hot research topic despite of the great efforts devoted to understanding its nature and experimental manifestations by the nuclear physics community over many years@xcite . \n for a recent review , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite . \n most of the previous studies have focused on the lg phase transition in symmetric nuclear matter . while in an asymmetric nuclear matter \n , the lg phase transition is expected to display some distinctly new features because of the isospin degree of freedom and the associated interactions and additional conservation laws@xcite . \n this expectation together with the need to understand better properties of asymmetric nuclear matter relevant for both nuclear physics and astrophysics have stimulated a lot of new work recentlyliko97,ma99,wang00,su00,lee01,li01,natowitz02,li02,chomaz03,sil04,lizx04,chomaz06,li07 . \n moreover , the study on the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter has received recently a strong boost from the impressive progress in developing more advanced radioactive beams that can be used to create transiently in terrestrial laboratories large volumes of highly asymmetric nuclear matter . though significant progress has been made recently in studying properties of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter and the lg phase transition in it , there are still many challenging questions to be answered . among the main difficulties \n are our poor understanding about the isovector nuclear interaction and the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite . \n fortunately , recent analyses of the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion reactions have allowed us to put a stringent constraint on the symmetry energy of neutron - rich matter at sub - normal densities betty04,chen05,lichen05 . \n it is therefore interesting to investigate how the constrained symmetry energy may allow us to better understand the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter . \n moreover , both the isovector ( i.e. , the nuclear symmetry potential ) and isoscalar parts of the single nucleon potential should be momentum dependent . \n however , effects of the momentum - dependent interactions on the lg phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter were not thoroughly investigated previously . \n we report here our recent progress in investigating effects of the isospin and momentum dependent interactions on the lg phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter within a self - consistent thermal model using three different interactions@xcite . \n the first one is the isospin and momentum dependent mdi interaction constrained by the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions . \n the second one is a momentum - independent interaction ( mid ) which leads to a fully momentum independent single nucleon potential , and the third one is an isoscalar momentum - dependent interaction ( emdyi ) in which the isoscalar part of the single nucleon potential is momentum dependent but the isovector part of the single nucleon potential is momentum independent . \n we note that the mdi interaction is realistic , while the other two are only used as references in order to explore effects of the isospin and momentum dependence of the nuclear interaction . \n in the isospin and momentum - dependent mdi interaction , the potential energy density @xmath0 of a thermally equilibrated asymmetric nuclear matter at total density @xmath1 , temperature @xmath2 and isospin asymmetry @xmath3 is expressed as follows  @xcite , @xmath4 in the mean field approximation , eq . \n ( [ mdiv ] ) leads to the following single particle potential for a nucleon with momentum @xmath5 and isospin @xmath6 in the thermally equilibrated asymmetric nuclear matter das03,chen05 \n @xmath7    in the above the isospin @xmath8 is @xmath9 for neutrons and @xmath10 for protons , and @xmath11 is the phase space distribution function at coordinate @xmath12 and momentum @xmath5 . \n the detailed values of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be found in ref . \n @xcite and have been assumed to be temperature independent here . \n the isospin and momentum - dependent mdi interaction gives the binding energy per nucleon of @xmath15 mev , incompressibility @xmath16 mev and the symmetry energy of @xmath17 mev for cold symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density @xmath18 @xmath19 @xcite . \n the different @xmath20 values in the mdi interaction are introduced to vary the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy while keeping other properties of the nuclear equation of state fixed @xcite . \n we note that the mdi interaction has been extensively used in the transport model for studying isospin effects in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei li04b , chen04,chen05,lichen05,li05pion , li06,yong061,yong062,yong07 . \n in particular , the isospin diffusion data from nscl / msu have constrained the value of @xmath20 to be between @xmath21 and @xmath22 for nuclear matter densities less than about @xmath23 @xcite . \n we will thus in the present work consider the two values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath24 giving a softer symmetry energy while @xmath25 giving a stiffer symmetry energy . \n the potential part of the symmetry energy @xmath26 at zero temperature can be parameterized by @xcite @xmath27 ( % \\frac{\\rho } { \\rho _ { 0}})^{g(x ) } , \\label{epotsym}\\]]where the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for different @xmath20 can be found in ref . \n @xcite .      in the momentum - independent mid interaction , \n the potential energy density @xmath30 of a thermally equilibrated asymmetric nuclear matter at total density @xmath1 and isospin asymmetry @xmath3 can be written as @xmath31the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are determined by the incompressibility @xmath35 of cold symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density @xmath36 as in ref . \n @xcite and @xmath35 is again set to be @xmath37 mev as in the mdi interaction . \n and @xmath26 is just same as eq . \n ( [ epotsym ] ) . \n so the mid interaction reproduces very well the eos of isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter with the mdi interaction at zero temperature for both @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n the single nucleon potential in the mid interaction can be directly obtained as @xmath38with @xmath39 { \\tau } { \\delta }   \\notag \\\\ & + & ( 18.6-f(x))(g(x)-1)(\\frac{\\rho } { \\rho _ { 0}})^{g(x)}{\\delta } ^{2}. \\label{uasy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the momentum - dependent part in the mdi interaction is also isospin dependent while the mid interaction is fully momentum independent . in order to see the effect of the momentum dependence of the isovector part of the single nucleon potential ( nuclear symmetry potential ) \n , we can construct an isoscalar momentum - dependent interaction , called extended mdyi ( emdyi ) interaction since it has the same functional form as the well - known mdyi interaction for symmetric nuclear matter @xcite . in the emdyi interaction , the potential energy density @xmath40 of a thermally equilibrated asymmetric nuclear matter at total density @xmath1 , temperature @xmath2 and isospin asymmetry @xmath3 is written as @xmath41here @xmath42 is the phase space distribution function of _ symmetric nuclear matter _ at total density @xmath1 and temperature @xmath2 . \n again @xmath26 has the same expression as eq . \n ( [ epotsym ] ) . \n we set @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath14 have the same values as in the mdi interaction , so that the emdyi interaction also gives the same eos of asymmetric nuclear matter as the mdi interaction at zero temperature for both @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n the single nucleon potential in the emdyi interaction can be obtained as@xmath47where @xmath48and @xmath49 is the same as eq . \n ( [ uasy ] ) which implies that the symmetry potential is identical for the emdyi and mid interactions . \n therefore , in the emdyi interaction , the isoscalar part of the single nucleon potential is momentum dependent but the nuclear symmetry potential is not .      at zero temperature , \n @xmath50 @xmath51 and all the integrals in above expressions can be calculated analytically @xcite , while at a finite temperature @xmath2 , the phase space distribution function becomes the fermi distribution @xmath52where @xmath53 is the chemical potential of proton or neutron and can be determined from@xmath54 in the above , @xmath55 is the proton or neutron mass and @xmath56 is the proton or neutron single nucleon potential in different interactions . from a self - consistency iteration scheme @xcite , the chemical potential @xmath53 and the distribution function @xmath57 can be determined numerically .    from the chemical potential @xmath53 and the distribution function @xmath58 \n , the energy per nucleon @xmath59 can be obtained as @xmath60 . \n \\label{e}\\]]furthermore , we can obtain the entropy per nucleon @xmath61 as @xmath62dp   \\label{s}\\]]with the occupation probability@xmath63finally , the pressure @xmath64 can be calculated from the thermodynamic relation @xmath65 \\rho+\\sum_{\\tau } \\mu _ { \\tau } \\rho _ { \\tau } . \n \\label{p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] \n with the above theoretical models , we can now study the lg phase transition in hot asymmetric nuclear matter . \n the phase coexistence is governed by the gibbs conditions and for the asymmetric nuclear matter two - phase coexistence equations are @xmath66where @xmath67 and @xmath68 stand for liquid phase and gas phase , respectively . \n the chemical stability condition is given by @xmath69the gibbs conditions ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coexistencep ] ) for phase equilibrium require equal pressures and chemical potentials for two phases with different concentrations and asymmetries . for a fixed pressure , the two solutions thus form the edges of a rectangle in the proton and neutron chemical potential isobars as a function of isospin asymmetry @xmath3 and can be found by means of the geometrical construction method @xcite .     at @xmath70 mev for the mdi and mid interactions(left ) and the emdyi interaction(right ) with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n the geometrical construction used to obtain the isospin asymmetries and chemical potentials in the two coexisting phases is also shown . taken from ref . \n @xcite . ]     at @xmath70 mev for the mdi and mid interactions(left ) and the emdyi interaction(right ) with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n the geometrical construction used to obtain the isospin asymmetries and chemical potentials in the two coexisting phases is also shown . taken from ref . \n @xcite . ] \n we calculate the chemical potential isobars at @xmath70 mev , which is a typical temperature of lg phase transition . \n the solid curves shown in the left panel of fig .  [ mudelta ] are the proton and neutron chemical potential isobars as a function of the isospin asymmetry @xmath71 at a fixed temperature @xmath70 mev and pressure @xmath72 mev@xmath73@xmath74 by using the mdi and mid interactions with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n the resulting rectangles from the geometrical construction are also shown by dotted lines in the left panel of fig . \n [ mudelta ] . \n when the pressure increases and approaches the critical pressure @xmath75 , an inflection point will appear for proton and neutron chemical potential isobars . above the critical pressure , the chemical potential of neutrons ( protons ) increases \n ( decreases ) monotonically with @xmath3 and the chemical instability disappears . in the left panel of fig . \n [ mudelta ] , we also show the chemical potential isobar at the critical pressure by the dashed curves . at the critical pressure , the rectangle is degenerated to a line vertical to the @xmath3 axis as shown by dash - dotted lines . \n the values of the critical pressure are @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 mev@xmath73@xmath80 for the mdi interaction with @xmath24 , mid interaction with @xmath24 , mdi interaction with @xmath25 and mid interaction with @xmath25 , respectively .    shown in the right panel of fig . \n [ mudelta ] is the chemical potential isobar as a function of the isospin asymmetry @xmath3 at @xmath70 mev by using the emdyi interaction with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n compared with the results from the mdi and mid interactions , the main difference is that the left ( and right ) extrema of @xmath81 and @xmath82 do not correspond to the same @xmath3 but they do for the mdi and mid interactions as shown in the left panel . \n the chemical potential of neutrons increases more rapidly with pressure than that of protons in this temperature . at lower pressures , for example , @xmath72 mev/@xmath80 as shown in panel ( a ) \n , the rectangle can be accurately constructed and thus the gibbs conditions ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coexistencep ] ) have two solutions . due to the asynchronous variation of @xmath81 and @xmath82 with pressure , we will get a limiting pressure @xmath83 above which no rectangle can be constructed and the coexistence equations ( [ coexistencemu ] ) and ( [ coexistencep ] ) have no solution . \n panel ( b ) shows the case at the limiting pressure with @xmath84 and @xmath85 mev/@xmath80 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . with increasing pressure , in panel ( c ) @xmath81 passes through an inflection point while @xmath82 still has a chemically unstable region , and in panel ( d ) @xmath82 passes through an inflection point while @xmath81 increases monotonically with @xmath3 .      for each interaction , \n the two different values of @xmath3 correspond to two different phases with different densities and the lower density phase ( with larger @xmath3 value ) defines a gas phase while the higher density phase ( with smaller @xmath71 value ) defines a liquid phase . collecting all such pairs of @xmath86 and @xmath87 thus forms the binodal surface . \n mev in the mdi and mid interactions with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n the critical point ( cp ) , the points of equal concentration ( ec ) and maximal asymmetry ( ma ) are also indicated . \n ( b ) the section of binodal surface at @xmath88 mev in the emdyi interaction with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n lp represents the limiting pressure . \n taken from ref .  @xcite . ]    in fig . \n [ pdelta ] ( a ) , we show the section of the binodal surface at @xmath88 mev for the mdi and mid interactions with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . on the left side of the binodal surface there \n only exists a liquid phase and on the right side only a gas phase exists . in the region of filet \n mignon  is the coexistence phase of liquid phase and gas phase . \n interestingly , we can see from fig . \n [ pdelta ] ( a ) that the stiffer symmetry energy ( @xmath25 ) significantly lowers the critical point ( cp ) and makes the maximal asymmetry ( ma ) a little smaller . \n meanwhile , the momentum dependence in the interaction ( mdi ) lifts the cp in a larger amount , while it seems to have no effects on the ma point . \n in addition , just as expected , the value of @xmath20 does not affect the equal concentration ( ec ) point while the momentum dependence lifts it slightly ( by about @xmath89 mev/@xmath80 ) . \n these features clearly indicate that the critical pressure and the area of phase - coexistence region in hot asymmetric nuclear matter is very sensitive to the stiffness of the symmetry energy with a softer symmetry energy giving a higher critical pressure and a larger area of phase - coexistence region . \n meanwhile , the critical pressure and the area of phase - coexistence region are also sensitive to the momentum dependence . \n the mdi interaction has a larger area of phase coexistence region and a larger value of the critical pressure , compared to the result of mid interaction in the temperature of @xmath70 mev . \n [ pdelta ] ( b ) displays the section of the binodal surface at @xmath70 mev by using the emdyi interaction with @xmath24 and @xmath25 . \n we can see that the curve is cut off at the limiting pressure with @xmath84 and @xmath90 mev/@xmath80 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . \n we can also see that the limiting pressure and the area of phase - coexistence region are still sensitive to the stiffness of the symmetry energy with a softer symmetry energy ( @xmath24 ) giving a higher limit pressure and a larger area of phase - coexistence region in this temperature .    comparing the results of the mdi and mid interactions shown in fig . \n [ pdelta ] ( a ) , we can see that for pressures lower than the limiting pressure , the binodal surface from the emdyi interaction is similar to that from the mdi interaction . \n this feature implies that the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential has little influence on the lg phase transition in hot asymmetric nuclear matter while the momentum dependence of the isoscalar single nucleon potential significantly changes the area of phase - coexistence region for pressures lower than the limiting pressure . for pressures above the limiting pressure \n , the momentum dependence of both the isoscalar and isovector single nucleon potentials becomes important . \n in summary , we have studied the liquid - gas phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter within a self - consistent thermal model using three different nuclear effective interactions , namely , the isospin and momentum dependent mdi interaction constrained by the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions , the momentum - independent mid interaction , and the isoscalar momentum - dependent emdyi interaction . at zero temperature , \n the above three interactions give the same eos for asymmetric nuclear matter . by analyzing liquid - gas phase transition in hot neutron - rich nuclear matter with the above three interactions , we find that the boundary of the phase - coexistence region is very sensitive to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy . \n a softer symmetry energy leads to a higher critical pressure and a larger area of the phase - coexistence region . \n in addition , the area of phase - coexistence region are also seen to be sensitive to the isospin and momentum dependence of the nuclear interaction . for the isoscalar momentum - dependent emdyi interaction , \n a limiting pressure above which the liquid - gas phase transition can not take place has been found . \n this work was supported in part by the national natural science foundation of china under grant nos . \n 10334020 , 10575071 , and 10675082 , moe of china under project ncet-05 -

      "abstract":  "This study explores the liquid-gas phase transition in hot, neutron-rich nuclear matter using a self-consistent thermal model with three effective nuclear interactions: isospin- and momentum-dependent (MDI), momentum-independent (MID), and an isoscalar momentum-dependent (EMDYI) interaction. The researchers show that the boundary of the coexistence region for liquid and gas phases is highly sensitive to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. A softer symmetry energy leads to a higher critical pressure and a larger coexistence region. Additionally, both isospin and momentum dependence of the interaction influence the phase transition. Notably, for EMDYI, a limiting pressure exists above which no transition occurs."

        "article": "even kakutani equivalence is one of the most natural examples in the theory of restricted orbit equivalence of ergodic and finite measure preserving dynamical systems . in this paper \n we study even kakutani equivalence in the nearly continuous category . \n a nearly continuous dynamical system is given by a triple @xmath13 , where @xmath2 is a polish space , @xmath14 is a borel probability measure on @xmath2 , and @xmath15 is an ergodic measure preserving homeomorphism . recall that a measurable orbit equivalence between two such systems @xmath13 and @xmath16 is an invertible , bi - measurable , and measure preserving map @xmath17 that sends orbits to orbits . a measurable orbit equivalence @xmath18 is a _ nearly continuous orbit equivalence _ if there exist invariant and @xmath11 subsets @xmath19 and @xmath20 of full measure so that @xmath21 is a homeomorphism . \n the first result in this category is the celebrated theorem of keane and smorodinsky @xcite that any two bernoulli shifts of equal entropy are finitarily isomorphic , namely , that the isomorphism between them can be made a homeomorphism almost everywhere . in a later paper , denker and keane \n @xcite established a general framework for studying measure preserving systems that also preserve a topological structure . \n we refer the reader to a paper by del junco , rudolph , and weiss @xcite for a more complete history of the area . \n we only mention here that interest in the orbit equivalence theory for this category was more recently revived by the work of hamachi and keane in @xcite where they proved that the binary and ternary odometers are nearly continuously orbit equivalent . \n their work inspired similar results for other pairs of examples ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) . \n these examples were later subsumed as special cases of a dye s theorem in this category proved by del junco and ahin @xcite .    around the same time as a nearly continuous dye \n s theorem was established , del junco , rudolph , and weiss proved in @xcite that if one does not impose the condition that the invariant sets of full measure on which the orbit equivalence is a homeomorphism are @xmath11 sets , then any restricted orbit equivalence classification is exactly the same as in the measure theoretic case . in particular \n , they showed that any orbit equivalence can be regularized to be a homeomorphism on a set of full measure , but could not prove that the set of full measure had any topological structure . \n the importance of the topological structure in the theory is even more striking for the study of even kakutani equivalence . \n recall that in the measurable category two ergodic and finite measure preserving systems @xmath13 and @xmath16 are even kakutani equivalent if there exists a measurable orbit equivalence @xmath22 , and measurable sets @xmath23 with @xmath24 with the property that @xmath25 is a measurable isomorphism of the induced transformations @xmath7 and @xmath26 . \n we call the orbit equivalence @xmath6 an _ even kakutani equivalence _ between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . \n it follows from @xcite that any even kakutani equivalence can be made to be a homeomorphism on a set of full measure . in the same paper \n they show that if one imposes the additional condition that the sets @xmath12 and @xmath27 be _ nearly clopen _ , meaning within a set of measure zero of an open set and also of a closed set , then there is a new invariant for even kakutani equivalence of nearly continuous dynamical systems called _ near unique ergodicity_. they use this new invariant to show that nearly continuous even kakutani equivalence is stronger than measure theoretic even kakutani equivalence . \n the example they construct is , in some sense , not natural , and begs the question whether there are any natural examples of nearly continuous systems that are measurably evenly kakutani equivalent but not nearly continuously so . \n rudolph began looking for examples in the family of zero entropy loosely bernoulli systems . \n recall that any two zero entropy loosely bernoulli transformations are measurably even kakutani equivalent . \n furthermore , many natural examples of nearly continuous systems including rotations , all adding machines , and in fact all finite rank transformations , are loosely bernoulli . in @xcite , \n roychowdhury and rudolph proved that any two adding machines are nearly continuously even kakutani equivalent . \n shortly after , dykstra and rudolph showed in @xcite that all irrational rotations are nearly continuously kakutani equivalent to the binary odometer .    in @xcite , new machinery , called _ templates _ \n , was introduced to construct the nearly continuous kakutani equivalence . \n there , templates were defined using the natural topological tower structure present in adding machines . \n the construction in @xcite showed that the template machinery can be adapted to the case where the underlying system does not have a canonical symbolic structure . \n more recently , springer @xcite expanded on their ideas and adapted templates further to prove that all minimal isometries of compact metric spaces are nearly continuously kakutani equivalent to the binary odometer . \n salvi @xcite adapted templates to the setting of @xmath28 actions and used the machinery to prove rudolph s two - step coding theorem in the nearly continuous category . \n each result mentioned above has required more sophisticated and technically intricate incarnations of templates . on the other hand \n each proof has also established the usefulness and flexibility of the machinery . in this paper \n we adapt the template machinery even further to show our main result :    the morse minimal system is nearly continuously even kakutani equivalent to the binary odometer .    the version of the template machinery in this paper is designed to address the new complication of the additional tower present in the rank two morse system . \n we believe the generalization we give here is the appropriate starting place to prove more generally that finite rank nearly continuous systems are all nearly continuously kakutani equivalent to the binary odometer . \n finally we note that this manuscript is a culmination of work that the first author began in 2009 while he was a post - doctoral fellow working with daniel rudolph at colorado state university . \n the initial architecture of the constructions and the main ideas were all established collaboratively by dykstra and rudolph . \n the second author joined the project after the untimely death of rudolph in 2010 , and the manuscript was completed in 2014 . \n in this section , deferring some formal definitions until later , we give an overview of the construction and introduce templates . \n let @xmath29 denote the morse minimal system and @xmath30 the binary odometer . recall that each system has a canonical refining , generating sequence of clopen partitions that are given by the finite rank structure of each system . \n the morse system is rank two , so at each stage the partition is defined by a pair of towers . \n the odometer is rank one , so the sequence of partitions is defined by a sequence of single towers . \n the construction of the orbit equivalence uses an inductive back and forthprocedure . \n intuitively , at each stage we need to construct a set map from the levels of the tower of one system to the levels of the tower of the other system , switching the domain and range of the set maps at each stage . \n the orbit equivalence will be defined on the set of points for which our procedure will converge . in order for this set to be \n a @xmath11 set , and the map to be a homeomorphism , for each point where we have convergence we need to have the procedure stabilize after a finite number of steps . \n in other words , once we have defined the set map at a particular stage @xmath31 , we can not modify its domain at any successive stage . \n this introduces an obvious complication in the construction . at a particular stage @xmath31 \n , we have to know that our choice of the set map on stage @xmath31 towers will be consistent with the choices that we will make for all stages after . to address this complication , informally speaking , \n we do not actually choose a particular set map at any stage . \n instead , at each stage we construct a collection of set maps that are possible extensions of previous stage set maps , and that all agree on a set we call _ the good set_. the convergence then depends on us being able to provide enough choices at each stage @xmath31 so that it is possible to construct sufficiently many choices of maps at stage @xmath32 that extend the @xmath31-stage maps . \n templates are a combinatorial tool that have been designed to facilitate the intensive book keeping required to describe such a procedure . \n formally , _ template _ is an ordered multiset . \n for example , the multiset @xmath33 , together with the ordering @xmath34 , gives a template @xmath35 , which we write as @xmath36 the elements of a template ( with multiplicity ) are called _ \n levels_. in our work , each level of a template will correspond to a clopen set that is a level of a tower . \n in particular , the towers themselves can be thought of as templates where each level appears exactly once and the ordering on the levels is exactly the ordering on the sets that is imposed by the underlying dynamics . \n notice that a set map from one tower to another can be thought of as a re - ordering of the levels of the domain tower according to the levels that they are being mapped to in the image tower . \n we replace the notion of a set map with maps between templates , where the re - ordering is not described by the map , but rather the ordering given by the image template . \n more formally , given templates @xmath35 and @xmath37 , written @xmath38 we _ represent _ @xmath35 and @xmath37 with the intervals @xmath39 \\subset { \\mathbb z}\\hspace{1 cm } \\mbox{and } \\hspace{1 cm } j = [ 0 , 1 , \\ldots , m-1 ] \\subset { \\mathbb z}\\ ] ] via the correspondences @xmath40 and @xmath41 . a _ partial interval bijection _ \n is an ordered quintuple @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is some bijection . \n this perspective allows for an explicit combinatorial understanding of how many maps need to be defined at each stage in order to construct maps at later stages , on larger domains . \n it also allows for an explicit combinatorial description of how maps from one stage are constructed from maps of a previous stage , so it is easy to prove that the construction has indeed stabilized for points on a @xmath11 set of full measure .      in our proof we will construct an increasing sequence @xmath46 , templates for each system and partial interval bijections between template sets that constitute the  back and forth \" diagram given in figure [ thefigure ] below . \n the objects in the diagram are template sets . \n the template sets on the left ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ) belong to the morse minimal system , while those on the right ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ) belong to the binary odometer . \n the maps @xmath55 are partial interval bijections . \n a key ingredient of the diagram is its _ almost commutative _ nature , as introduced by roychowdhury and rudolph in @xcite . interpreting the levels of templates as levels of towers that form a refining sequence of partitions \n , we see that every level at stage @xmath31 of a tower is a subset of a level from a previous stage template , and the maps @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the natural inclusion maps . \n the consistency of set maps from one level to another is achieved by requiring that on the good set , all partial interval bijections agree when composed with @xmath56 and @xmath57 . \n there are two key differences our work here and that of @xcite or @xcite in how we use templates from a particular stage to construct later stage templates . in particular , we can not use the notion of concatenation as was defined in the earlier papers , instead we define _ overlapping concatenations_. in addition , to accommodate the combinatoric structure of the towers of the morse minimal system we introduce a new family of partial interval bijections called _ reordering maps_. once the diagram is built up , however , the argument that it produces a well - defined nearly continuous kakutani equivalence is nearly identical to the arguments in both @xcite and @xcite . \n we include it here for completeness ( see sections [ convergenceofpibs ] and [ kakequivalence ] ) .    it is our hope that one day we might discover a more general machine that could characterize broad classes of systems , perhaps even all zero entropy loosely bernoulli systems . \n but at the moment it is not clear how such a machine , if one exists , could be sufficiently general to account for the differences between systems . \n the paper is organized as follows :    section [ overview ] : :    we define the tools for constructing templates and partial interval    bijections that we will use throughout the construction . \n sections [ morsepreliminaries ] - [ binarypreliminaries ] : :    we give preliminary definitions of the morse minimal system and the    binary odometer . in particular , we define the template sets    @xmath58 ,    @xmath59 ,    @xmath60 , and    @xmath61 , for @xmath62 . \n these template sets are given by the towers in the respective system . \n section [ omegaksection ] : :    we define the template sets @xmath63 and    @xmath64 , for @xmath62 \n . these    are templates in the odometer system that are rearrangements of the    tower templates , reflecting set maps that map morse towers to odometer    towers . \n section [ stage2 ] : :    we construct stage @xmath65 of the diagram by explicitly    defining @xmath66 , along with the partial interval bijections    @xmath67 . \n section [ tksection ] : :    we define the template sets @xmath68 and    @xmath69 , for @xmath62 . \n these are new templates in the morse system , describing how odometer    towers will be mapped to morse towers . \n section [ sequences ] : :    we define the sequence @xmath46 recursively . sections [ freqnotation ] - [ stage8 ] : :    we assume the diagram has been built down to stage @xmath31 ,    where @xmath31 is even , and show how to build it down to stage    @xmath70 . because the construction depends on whether    @xmath71 or @xmath72 , we    proceed as follows :    +    * in sections [ freqnotation ] - [ blockpartitionsoftauhat ] , we introduce    notation and machinery that is used for every even @xmath31 .    * in sections [ thegoodset ] - [ stage4missingextra ] , we illustrate the    @xmath73 case by building the diagram down to    stage @xmath74 .    * in sections [ stage6bigpicture ] - [ stage6missingextra ] \n , we illustrate    the @xmath72 case by building the diagram down    to stage @xmath75 .    * in section [ stage8 ] , \n we indicate how the induction looks in stages    @xmath76 . \n sections [ convergenceofpibs ] - [ kakequivalence ] : :    we use the properties of the diagram to prove that our procedure    produces a nearly continuous kakutani equivalence between the two    systems . \n in this section we introduce the terminology and tools necessary to build and extend partial interval bijections . \n [ domainandrange ] given templates @xmath35 and @xmath37 , and a partial interval bijection @xmath42 $ ] from @xmath35 to @xmath37 , the _ domain _ of @xmath77 consists of those levels in @xmath35 that are represented by @xmath12 . \n the _ range _ of @xmath77 consists of those levels in @xmath37 that are represented by @xmath27

interval bijection @xmath100 $ ] . \n suppose @xmath101 $ ] for @xmath102 are two partial interval bijections , and assume each @xmath103 and @xmath104 begin at @xmath105 . \n let @xmath106 and

bijections . also note that , if @xmath108 and @xmath109 are partial interval bijections , then so is @xmath112 .      for our construction , some partial interval bijections will need to be decomposed into a form @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 make up a very small portion of the overall map . \n we will refer to @xmath114 and @xmath115 as the _ bottom _ and _ top sticky notes _ of @xmath77 . \n the _ body _ is @xmath116 . \n we will often want to  glue \" partial interval bijections together . top and bottom sticky notes will be our means of doing this via the following definition . \n [ overlapconcatenation1 ]    suppose @xmath101 $ ] for @xmath102 are two partial interval bijections that are decomposed via ( [ stage2pibstructure ] ) as @xmath117 if @xmath118 \n , then define the _ overlapping concatenation _ of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , denoted @xmath119 , by @xmath120      the sticky notes described in section [ stickynotes ] will be used only in the early stages of the construction . from then on , top and bottom sticky notes \n will _ overlap _ with the body , so that a typical partial interval bijection will need to be decomposed into the form @xmath121 where again @xmath114 and @xmath115 make up a very small portion of the overall map . here \n again , we will refer to @xmath114 and @xmath115 as the bottom and top sticky notes , and @xmath116 as the body , of @xmath77 . \n once we are far enough along in the construction that sticky note decompositions take the form ( [ stage4pibstructure ] ) , we will no longer be able to use definition [ overlapconcatenation1 ] to glue partial interval bijections together . \n we will instead use the following . \n [ overlapconcatenation2 ]    suppose @xmath101 $ ] for @xmath102 are two partial interval bijections that are decomposed via ( [ stage4pibstructure ] ) as @xmath122 if @xmath118 , then define the _ overlapping concatenation _ of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , denoted @xmath119 , by @xmath123      a _ reordering map _ is a partial interval bijection of the form @xmath124 $ ] . \n unlike arbitrary partial interval bijections , in a reordering map each of the first four components is the same interval . \n therefore it is possible to compose two reordering maps , as follows . \n if @xmath125 and @xmath126 are two bijections , then , as a usual composition of functions , @xmath127 is a bijection . \n therefore we can define @xmath128 _ composed with _ \n @xmath129 to be the reordering map @xmath130 $ ] . \n reordering maps will be used to move certain levels in the  bottom part \" of a template up to the  top part , \" while shifting all levels in the  middle part \" down . \n for example , consider the template @xmath131 and think of @xmath132 as the  middle part \" . \n suppose we wish to shift this middle part down by two positions . \n we could accomplish this , for example , by moving @xmath133 and @xmath134 from the bottom part to the top part , as follows . \n let @xmath135 $ ] and define @xmath125 by @xmath136 and @xmath137 by @xmath138 notice that @xmath139 is the ( new ) template @xmath140 and @xmath141 is the ( new ) template

of all doubly infinite sequences @xmath165 in @xmath166 such that every finite subword of @xmath167 occurs as a subword of the morse sequence . \n given @xmath167 and @xmath168 in @xmath2 , let

@xmath175 . \n the _ morse minimal system _ is then the system @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the left shift , and @xmath14 is the unique complete ergodic borel probability measure .    the following results are proved in @xcite .    [ partitionprop ] for each @xmath178 and @xmath157 , there exists a unique partition of @xmath179 into intervals of length @xmath180 so that the subword of @xmath167 on each interval of this partition

@xmath246 are the trivial canonical templates for the binary odometer ( each consisting of just one level ) as indicated in figure  [ thefigure ] . \n the template sets @xmath63 and @xmath247 , defined in section  [ omegakdefinition ] consist of templates of the following types : basic , diminished , augmented , missing and extra . \n we begin by describing these types of templates .      a _ basic template _ at stage \n @xmath147 is any template that satisfies all of the following conditions : it has height @xmath159 ; its elements are @xmath147-canonical cylinders ; and its ordering is  allowed \" by the action of @xmath1 .    for the ordering of a template @xmath248 to be  allowed \" by the action of @xmath1 , @xmath248 must have one of the following forms . \n either it is a special basic template @xmath249 that we will refer to as the _ zero - template _ , or for some ( unique ) @xmath250 , @xmath248 is : @xmath251    let @xmath252 be the set of all basic templates for the binary odometer at stage @xmath147 .    in each basic template , the level @xmath240 occurs once and only once . \n call this level the _ \n global cut_.      if @xmath253 is a basic template , define the _ predecessor _ template for @xmath35 , denoted @xmath254 , to be the basic template whose global cut is one position higher ( mod @xmath159 ) , and define the _ successor _ template for @xmath248 , denoted @xmath255 , to be the basic template whose global cut is one position lower ( mod @xmath159 ) . for example , if @xmath253 is : @xmath256 then @xmath254 is @xmath257 and @xmath255 is @xmath258      given a basic template @xmath253 , define two additional , _ diminished _ \n templates @xmath259 and @xmath260 as follows :    * @xmath259 is @xmath248 with the global cut removed , and with an extra level tacked on at the bottom ( the level that would naturally precede the bottom level in @xmath248 , namely the pre - image of the bottom level of @xmath248 under the map @xmath1 ) . \n * @xmath260 is @xmath248 with the global cut removed , and with an extra level tacked on at the top ( the level that would naturally follow the top level in @xmath248 , namely the image of the top level in @xmath248 under the map @xmath1 ) . \n for example , if @xmath253 is given by @xmath256 then @xmath259 is given by @xmath261    the letters  d \" and  u \" refer to  down \" and  up \" , respectively , for reasons that will be made clear later . \n let @xmath262 be the set of all diminished templates for the binary odometer at stage @xmath147 . \n note that all diminished templates in @xmath262 have height @xmath159 .      given a basic template @xmath253 , \n define two additional , _ augmented _ templates as follows :    * @xmath263 is @xmath248 with an extra copy of the global cut , @xmath240 , inserted right next to the actual global cut , and with the bottom level deleted . \n * @xmath264 is @xmath248 with an extra copy of the global cut , @xmath240 , inserted right next to the actual global cut , and with the top level deleted . \n for example , if @xmath253 is given by @xmath256 then @xmath263 is given by @xmath265    let @xmath266 be the set of all augmented templates for the binary odometer at stage @xmath147 . \n note that all augmented templates in @xmath266 have height @xmath159 .      given a basic template @xmath253 , \n define one additional , _ missing _ template , denoted @xmath267 , to be @xmath248 with its bottom level removed . \n for example , if @xmath248 is the zero - template , then @xmath268    let @xmath269 be the set of all missing templates for the binary odometer at stage @xmath147 . \n note that all missing templates have height @xmath270 .      given a basic template @xmath253 , \n define one additional , _ extra _ template , denoted @xmath271 , to be @xmath248 with an one extra level tacked on at the top ( the level that would naturally follow the top level ) . \n for example , if @xmath253 is given by @xmath256 then @xmath271 is given by @xmath272    let @xmath273 be the set of all extra templates for the binary odometer at stage @xmath147 . \n note that all extra templates in @xmath273 have height @xmath274 . \n define @xmath276 , so that the canonical templates in @xmath277 have height @xmath74 . for each canonical template @xmath278 for the morse system , and for each template @xmath279 in the binary odometer , we will define a partial interval bijection @xmath280 from a subset of the levels in @xmath281 to a subset of the levels in @xmath248 . \n only after we have done this will we define partial interval bijections from the modified canonical templates in @xmath282 to the modified templates in @xmath283 . \n there are exactly four basic templates in @xmath284 :    * @xmath285 , * @xmath286 , * @xmath287 , and * @xmath288 .    for @xmath289 and @xmath290 , \n define @xmath291 to be the partial interval bijection @xmath292 $ ] , where :    * @xmath293 \\subset { \\mathbb z}$ ] , * @xmath294 , * @xmath295 , * @xmath296 , and * each @xmath297 is the obvious bijection @xmath298 . \n note that each @xmath299 is equivalent to @xmath300 as a formal map between intervals in @xmath179 . \n but of course @xmath301 and @xmath302 are different as set maps because the levels represented by @xmath12 in @xmath303 and @xmath304 are different \n . now recall definition [ domainandrange ] , where the domain and range of a partial interval bijection are defined . \n the following propositions are obvious . \n [ nobottomortop ] for each canonical template @xmath278 , neither the bottom level nor the top level is in the domain of any @xmath305 . \n [ nobottomtoporcut ] given @xmath306 , the global cut in @xmath248 is not in the range of @xmath305 . \n we now define the  good set \" at stage @xmath222 , and establish its most important property ( proposition [ stage2goodsetprop ] ) , which is obvious at this stage because @xmath245 is the trivial canonical template . \n let @xmath307 . \n recall the vertical map @xmath308 which was defined in section [ pkpi ] . \n we similarly define @xmath309 . \n the following is immediate since @xmath310 . \n [ stage2goodsetprop ] if @xmath311 and @xmath312 , then @xmath313 is in the domain of both @xmath305 and @xmath314 , and @xmath315 . \n let @xmath248 be a basic template in @xmath284 . \n define @xmath316 to match with @xmath305 , and define @xmath317 to match with @xmath318 , as in definition [ match ] . \n that these bijections are well defined follows from proposition [ nobottomtoporcut ] ; for example , suppose @xmath248 is given by @xmath319 where the box indicates the level that is in the range of @xmath305 . \n then , using this same  box \" notation to indicate the levels in the ranges of the corresponding partial interval bijections , we have @xmath320 @xmath321 and @xmath322 now observe that @xmath323 , and its corresponding partial interval bijection , are : @xmath324 that @xmath325 matches with @xmath317 is not a coincidence :    [ stage2diminishedmatching ] given any basic template @xmath306 , @xmath317 matches with @xmath326 .    both @xmath317 and @xmath326 \n are defined to match with @xmath318 . \n similarly , given @xmath306 , define @xmath327 to match with @xmath305 , and define @xmath328 to match with @xmath318 . that these definitions are possible again follows from proposition  [ nobottomtoporcut ] . \n [ stage2augmentedmatching ] given any basic template @xmath306 , @xmath328 matches with @xmath329 .    both @xmath328 and @xmath329 \n are defined to match with @xmath318 .      recall the modified template sets @xmath282 and @xmath330 defined in and . given @xmath331 and @xmath332 , we know from propositions [ nobottomortop ] and [ nobottomtoporcut ] that the bottom level of @xmath281 is not in the domain of @xmath333 , nor is the bottom level of @xmath248 in the range \n therefore , if @xmath334 $ ] , where @xmath335 $ ] , then we may define @xmath336 by @xmath337 $ ] , where @xmath338 $ ] . in other words \n , @xmath339 is identical to @xmath340 except that the bottom level of @xmath248 is technically missing . \n similarly , given @xmath341 and @xmath342 , if again @xmath334 $ ] , then we may define @xmath343 by @xmath344 $ ] , where @xmath345 $ ] . \n in other words , @xmath343 is identical to @xmath280 except that there is technically an extra level at the top . \n similar to @xmath63 and @xmath247 , the template sets @xmath68 and @xmath69 , defined in section  [ tkdefinition ] below , consist of templates of the following types : basic , diminished , augmented , missing , and extra . \n we define these types here . \n a _ basic template _ at stage @xmath147 is any template that satisfies the all of the following conditions : it has height @xmath159 , its elements are @xmath147-canonical cylinders , and its ordering is  allowed \" by the action of @xmath0 .    for the ordering of a template @xmath35 to be  allowed \" by the action of @xmath0 \n , @xmath35 must have one of the following forms :    1 . \n this is a special basic template we call the _ zero - template_. 2 . \n this is a special basic template we call the _ one - template_. 3 .   [ fourforms ] for some ( unique ) @xmath250 , @xmath35 is one of the following four templates : @xmath348 @xmath349 @xmath350 @xmath351    let @xmath352 be the set of all basic templates for the morse system at stage @xmath147 .    in each basic template , exactly one of the levels is either @xmath206 or @xmath207 . \n call that level the _ \n global cut_.      if @xmath353 is a basic template whose global cut is neither the bottom level nor the top level , then @xmath35 must be one of the four templates listed in item [ fourforms ] of section [ morsebasictemplates ] above . in this case , define the _ predecessor _ template for @xmath35 , denoted @xmath354 , to be the basic template of that same form whose global cut is one position higher , and define the _ successor _ template for @xmath35 , denoted @xmath355 , to be the basic template of that same form whose global cut is one position lower . \n for example , if @xmath353 is the template @xmath356 then @xmath357 is @xmath358 and @xmath359 is @xmath360    if @xmath353 is a basic template whose global cut is the bottom level , then @xmath35 is either the zero - template or the one - template . in this case , define two predecessor templates for @xmath35 , denoted @xmath361 and @xmath362 , as follows :    * @xmath361 is @xmath35 with the top level removed and @xmath363 tacked on at the bottom . \n * @xmath362 is @xmath35 with the top level removed and @xmath364 tacked on at the bottom . \n also in this case , define two successor templates for @xmath35 , denoted @xmath365 and @xmath366 , as follows :    * @xmath365 is @xmath35 with the bottom level removed and @xmath206 tacked on at the top . \n * @xmath366 is @xmath35 with the bottom level removed and @xmath207 tacked on at the top .    if @xmath353 is a basic template whose global cut is the top level ( there are exactly two such basic templates ) , then define two predecessor templates for @xmath35 , denoted @xmath361 and @xmath362 , as follows :    * @xmath361 is @xmath35 with the top level ( the global cut ) removed and @xmath206 tacked on at the bottom . \n * @xmath362 is @xmath35 with the top level ( the global cut ) removed and @xmath367 tacked on at the bottom .    also in this case , define a single successor template for @xmath35 , denoted @xmath355 , to be the basic template that is @xmath35 with its bottom level removed , and with the level that would naturally follow the top level tacked on at the top . for example , if @xmath353 is @xmath368 then @xmath355 is @xmath369    because certain templates have multiple predecessor / successor templates , while others have only one , the following definition will be useful . \n if @xmath353 is a basic template , then a _ predecessor template for @xmath35 _ is any basic template of the form @xmath354 , @xmath361 , or @xmath362 , as defined above . \n successor template for @xmath35 _ is any basic template of the form @xmath355 , @xmath365 , or @xmath366 , as defined above . \n if @xmath353 is a basic template , then all predecessor templates for @xmath35 agree in every level except possibly the bottom . \n also , all successor templates for @xmath35 agree in every level except possibly the top .      given a basic template @xmath353 \n that is neither the zero - template nor the one - template , define two additional , _ diminished _ templates @xmath370 and @xmath371 as follows :    * @xmath370 is @xmath35 with the global cut removed , and with an extra level tacked on at the bottom ( the level that would naturally precede the bottom level ) . \n * @xmath371 is @xmath35 with the global cut removed , and with an extra level tacked on at the top ( the level that would naturally follow the top level ) . \n for example , suppose @xmath353 is given by @xmath372    then the global cut is @xmath207 , and the bottom level is @xmath194 . \n the level that would naturally precede this bottom level is @xmath373 . \n therefore the diminished template @xmath370 is given by @xmath374    now suppose @xmath353 is either the zero - template or the one - template . \n then there are two levels that could naturally precede the bottom level ( either @xmath363 or @xmath364 ) , as well as two levels that could naturally follow the top level ( either @xmath206 or @xmath207 ) . \n for this reason , we define four diminished templates , as follows :    * @xmath375 is @xmath35 with the global cut ( which , in this case , is also the bottom level ) removed , and with the level @xmath363 tacked on in its place . * @xmath376 is @xmath35 with the global cut ( which , in this case , is also the bottom level ) removed , and with the level @xmath364 tacked on in its place . * @xmath377 is @xmath35 with the global cut ( which , in this case , is also the bottom level ) removed , and with the level @xmath206 tacked on at the top . \n * @xmath378 is @xmath35 with the global cut ( which , in this case , is also the bottom level ) removed , and with the level @xmath207 tacked on at the top . \n for example , if @xmath35 is the zero template , then @xmath376 is @xmath379    let @xmath380 be the set of all diminished templates for the morse system at stage @xmath147 . \n note that all diminished templates in @xmath380 have height @xmath159 .      given a basic template @xmath353 , \n define four additional , _ augmented _ templates as follows :    * @xmath381 is @xmath35 with an extra copy of @xmath206 inserted directly before the global cut , and with the bottom level deleted . \n * @xmath382 is @xmath35 with an extra copy of @xmath207 inserted directly before the global cut , and with the bottom level deleted . \n * @xmath383 is @xmath35 with an extra copy of @xmath206 inserted directly before the global cut , and with the top level deleted . \n * @xmath384 is @xmath35 with an extra copy of @xmath207 inserted directly before the global cut , and with the top level deleted . \n for example , if @xmath353 is given by @xmath356    then @xmath381 is given by @xmath385    let @xmath386 be the set of all augmented templates for the morse system at stage @xmath147 . \n note that all augmented templates in @xmath386 have height @xmath159 . \n given a basic template @xmath353 , define one additional , _ missing _ template , denoted @xmath387 , to be @xmath35 with its bottom level removed . \n for example , if @xmath35 is the zero - template , then @xmath388 let @xmath389 be the set of all missing templates for the morse system at stage @xmath147 . \n note that all missing templates have height @xmath270 .      given a basic template @xmath353 that is neither the zero - template nor the one - template , \n define one additional , _ extra _ template , denoted @xmath390 , to be @xmath35 with one extra level tacked on at the top ( the level that would naturally follow the top level ) . \n for example , if @xmath353 is given by @xmath391 then @xmath390 is given by @xmath392 if @xmath35 is the zero - template or the one - template , then define two extra templates , as follows :    * @xmath393 is @xmath35 with the level @xmath206 tacked on at the top . \n * @xmath394 is @xmath35 with the level @xmath207 tacked on at the top . \n let @xmath395 be the set of all extra templates for the morse system at stage @xmath147 . \n note that all extra templates in @xmath395 have height @xmath274 . \n let @xmath397 be a summable sequence . recall that we defined @xmath244 and @xmath276 \n . now define @xmath398 , @xmath399 , by the following two -

blocks in @xmath468 and @xmath469_. \n a _ local block in @xmath35 _ is any local block from definitions [ localblocks1 ] or [ localblocks2 ] . \n the _ local block partition of @xmath35 _ is the partition of @xmath35 into its local blocks . the first level in a local block \n is called a _ local cut in @xmath35_.      recall that each basic template @xmath423 has four variation types : diminished , augmented , missing , and extra . and within a given variation type , there may be multiple templates . \n but any such template is constructed by applying one or both of the following operations to @xmath35 :    1 . \n remove one level from the bottom of a local block in @xmath35 , 2 . \n insert one new level at the top ( or bottom ) of a local block in @xmath35 . \n therefore , if @xmath37 is a diminished , augmented , missing , or extra version of @xmath35 , then the intermediate and local block partitions of @xmath35 determine intermediate and local block partitions of @xmath37 , as follows :    1 . \n suppose a level , @xmath459 , is removed from the bottom of a local block @xmath27 . \n let @xmath472 be the intermediate block that contains @xmath27 . \n then , in the intermediate and local block partitions of @xmath37 , replace @xmath27 and @xmath472 with @xmath473 and @xmath474 . leave all other intermediate and local blocks alone . \n 2 .   suppose a level , @xmath459 , is inserted at the top ( resp . , bottom ) of a local block @xmath27 . \n let @xmath472 be the intermediate block that contains @xmath27 . \n then , in the intermediate and local block partitions of @xmath37 , replace @xmath27 and @xmath472 with @xmath475 and @xmath476 , where , in the new order , @xmath459 is the top ( resp . \n , bottom ) level in @xmath475 . \n leave all other intermediate and local blocks alone . \n recall the definition of a reordering map in section [ reorderingmaps ] . \n we will employ two types of reordering maps : _ global _ and _ intermediate_. roughly speaking , the _ global _ reordering map takes a small number of levels in @xmath35 that occur in positions from the bottom global safe zone in @xmath85 and moves them , one by one , up to the top global safe zone . \n this has the effect of sliding all levels in @xmath35 that do not occur in the global safe zones ( those in the  middle part \" ) down . \n here is the formal definition :    the _ global reordering map for @xmath35 _ is a map @xmath477 $ ] where    1 .   if @xmath478 , then @xmath479 and therefore @xmath129 is the identity . \n 2 .   if @xmath480 then @xmath479 is defined so that @xmath129 takes the bottom levels in @xmath481 and inserts them , in order , directly after the top levels in @xmath482 . observe that this means @xmath129 shifts all levels in @xmath35 that do not occur in the global safe zones down by exactly @xmath430 positions . \n more formally when @xmath480 , for each intermediate block @xmath445 in @xmath85 , let @xmath483 and @xmath484 denote the smallest and largest integers in @xmath445 , respectively \n . then @xmath485 , where , for @xmath486 , @xmath487    [ intcutspostp1 ] the intermediate cuts in @xmath139 that do not occur in the global safe zones occur in positions in @xmath85 that are congruent to @xmath105 mod @xmath452 . \n this follows immediately from the definitions and implies that the intermediate cuts in @xmath139 that do not occur in the global safe zones  line up \" with intermediate cuts in the zero template @xmath488 . \n this in turn implies that the intermediate blocks in @xmath139 that do not occur in the global safe zones also line up with intermediate blocks in the zero template .      if @xmath431 , then the intermediate block partition of @xmath35 is given by ( [ simpleinttau ] ) and @xmath489 . in this case \n we define the intermediate block partition of @xmath139 to be identical to the intermediate block partition of @xmath35 . \n formally @xmath490(0 ) \\cup [ \\hat p_1(\\tau)](1 ) \\cup \\cdots \\cup [ \\hat p_1(\\tau)](l-1),\\ ] ] where each @xmath491(m ) = \\tau(m)$ ] . in this @xmath478 case \n we define the the local block partition of @xmath139 to be identical to the local block partition of @xmath35 ( see ( [ talltaupartition ] ) ) . \n formally , for @xmath434 , @xmath492(m ) = [ \\hat p_1(\\tau)](m , 0 ) \\cup [ \\hat p_1(\\tau)](m , 1 ) \\cup \\cdots \\cup [ \\hat p_1(\\tau)](m , l'-1)\\ ] ] where each @xmath491(m , i ) = \\tau(m , i)$ ] .    now suppose @xmath435 , so that the intermediate block partition of @xmath35 is given by ( [ complicatedinttau ] ) . \n then @xmath129 takes the bottom levels in @xmath481 and inserts them , in order , directly after the top levels in @xmath482 . \n then we define the intermediate block partition of @xmath139 by @xmath493(0 ) \\cup [ \\hat p_1(\\tau)](1 ) \\cup \\cdots \\cup [ \\hat p_1(\\tau)](l)\\ ] ] where :    * for @xmath494 , @xmath491(m ) = \\tau(m)$ ] , and * for @xmath495 , @xmath491(m)$ ] is

( see proposition [ twocases ] ) . for the odometer system , then , after global reordering , every local block that is not in the global safe zones matches the corresponding local block in the zero template , in the sense that it has the same image under @xmath580 .    for the morse system , \n the intermediate reordering map was defined so that , after both global and intermediate reordering , every other local block that is neither in the global nor intermediate safe zones moved down by exactly one complete local block . as a consequence of the combinatoric structure of the morse system , now every other such local block matches the corresponding local block in the zero template . to see why this is the case , consider the morse sequence and its flip : @xmath581 notice that , if we shift the flip to the left by one coordinate , then it matches the morse sequence in every other coordinate . \n the same would be true for sequences of substitution blocks ( just replace @xmath105 s

set of all levels in @xmath650 and those levels in @xmath526 that occur in positions from @xmath651 . \n moreover , the same bijection can be used for all reordered templates @xmath526 \n so that , given @xmath568 and @xmath569 in @xmath644 and @xmath652 , @xmath653 .    finally , define @xmath654 where @xmath655 denotes the restriction of @xmath656 to the subinterval of @xmath657 corresponding

not in the range of any @xmath624 \n .    follows from proposition [ nobottomortop ] . \n [ stage4matchingprop ] let @xmath643 . \n then , given @xmath568 and @xmath569 in @xmath644 and partial

together with the definition of the partial interval bijections @xmath624 . \n we now define maps to diminished , augmented , missing , and extra templates , and establish analogues of lemmas [

stage 6 is analogous to stage 4 , but with one new layer of complexity : whereas the maps in stage 4 were defined as _ concatenations _ of maps from stage 2 , the maps in stage 6 will be _ overlapping concatenations _ of the maps from stage 4 . \n the top and bottom sticky notes defined in stage 4 are used to glue these overlapping concatenations together . \n we need to verify that there are enough sticky notes defined in stage 4 to choose from so that these overlapping concatenations are well - defined . \n the global reordering map in stage 6 , denoted @xmath129 , is the same as it was in stage 4 except , of course , now @xmath698 $ ] . in stage 4 , \n an intermediate reordering map was also used to ensure that every other local block that does not occur in a safe zone has the same image under @xmath580 as the corresponding local block in the zero - template ( see proposition [ everyotherproperty ] ) . \n but an intermediate reordering map is not needed in stage 6 because the odometer has just one canonical tower at each stage  not two . \n so in stage 6 , let the intermediate reordering map @xmath128 be simply the identity . given @xmath699 , \n let @xmath700 . \n define the intermediate and local block partitions of @xmath701 , as well as the intermediate block partition of @xmath702 , in exactly the same way that they were defined in stage 4 ( see sections [ p1hatpartitions ] and [ blockpartitionsoftauhat ] ) except , of course , that @xmath35 is replaced with @xmath248 . \n given an intermediate block @xmath703 in @xmath702 , because the intermediate reordering map @xmath128 is simply the identity , just like in stage 4 , define the local block partition of @xmath703 to be identical to the local block partition of @xmath704(m)$ ] . \n the good set within @xmath85 at stage @xmath75 , @xmath705 , is defined in section [ thegoodset ] . \n let @xmath706 , called the _ good set at stage @xmath75 _ , consist of those levels in @xmath707 that occur in positions from @xmath705 . note that proposition [ everyotherproperty ] holds in stage 6 . \n given @xmath699 , the sets @xmath708 and @xmath709 are defined analogously to the definitions in section [ headsandtails ] ( just replace @xmath35 , @xmath248 , @xmath66 , and @xmath710 with @xmath248 , @xmath35 , @xmath710 , and @xmath711 , respectively ) . \n however , there is an added layer of complexity in stage 6 : if @xmath712 ( or @xmath713 ) , then @xmath35 has head and tail sets of its own , @xmath714 and @xmath715 .      much like in stage 6 , given @xmath699 , the partial interval bijections @xmath305 take the form @xmath716 where @xmath717 represents _ overlapping concatenation _ as defined in definition [ overlapconcatenation1 ] . \n there is one such partial interval bijection for each pair @xmath718 . \n the maps @xmath719 , @xmath720 , and @xmath721 are defined analogously to the definitions in sections [ stage4stickynotes ] and [ stage4bodymap ] except that within the body map @xmath720 ( section [ stage4bodymap ] ) , concatenations ( @xmath722 ) are replaced with overlapping concatenations ( @xmath723 ) . \n we now show that the overlapping concatenations within @xmath720 can be glued together . \n suppose @xmath608 ( the case that @xmath618 is nearly identical ) . \n then , following what was done in section [ stage4bodymap ] , we define @xmath724 to take the form @xmath725    [ possiblebodyoverlaps ] with the templates @xmath726 from ( [ phiomegabodydecomp ] ) listed in order of overlapping concatenation ( @xmath727 ) , the following six types of successive pairs can occur :    1 . \n @xmath728 where @xmath729 , 2 . \n @xmath730 where @xmath731 , 3 . \n @xmath732 , where @xmath331 and @xmath733 , 4 . \n @xmath734 , where @xmath731 , 5 . \n @xmath735 , where @xmath341 and @xmath733 , and 6 . \n @xmath736 , where @xmath731 .    by construction . \n [ bodyoverlapsvalid ] in any of the six cases of proposition [ possiblebodyoverlaps ] , top and bottom sticky notes can be chosen so that the overlapping concatenation of the corresponding partial interval bijections @xmath737 are well - defined . \n case 1 is trivial because partial interval bijections to the zero- and one - templates do not have sticky notes ( there is no overlap to worry about ) . for case 2 , \n observe that if @xmath306 is a basic template from stage 2 such that @xmath630 , then @xmath632 as well , so we can glue @xmath738 together with itself by picking such @xmath739 on the overlap . for case 3 , observe that there exists @xmath306 such that @xmath740 and @xmath741 . \n lemma [ stage2diminishedmatching ] then guarantees that there is a bottom sticky note on @xmath624 that matches with a top sticky note on @xmath742 . \n cases 4 - 6 are similar . \n the following shows that is well defined . \n top and bottom sticky notes can be chosen so that the overlapping concatenations @xmath743 and @xmath744 are well - defined . \n similar to the proof of proposition [ bodyoverlapsvalid ] . \n the following propositions are analogous to propositions from stage 4 .    neither the bottom level nor the top level of @xmath745 or @xmath746 is in the domain of any @xmath305 \n .    follows from proposition [ stage4nocut ] . \n given @xmath699 , the global cut in @xmath248 is not in the range of any @xmath305 . \n follows from proposition [ stage4nobottomortop ] . \n let @xmath747 and let @xmath748 be a level that occurs in position @xmath576 , where @xmath331 . then , given @xmath661 and @xmath749 in @xmath750 and partial interval bijections @xmath662 and @xmath751 of the form ( [ phiomegabodydecomp ] ) , both @xmath662 and @xmath751 are defined on @xmath313 , and @xmath752 . \n proposition [ everyotherproperty ] can be used to show that lemma [ stage4matching ] holds in stage 6 ( with appropriate notational modifications ) . \n the proposition follows . \n the definitions of these modified maps are analogous to those in stage 4 . \n maps to missing and extra templates are needed to define the maps at stage 8 in places where individual levels have been deleted or inserted . \n analogues of lemmas [ stage4dimlemma ] and [ stage4auglemma ] hold in stage 6 , and are used to glue sticky notes together in stage 10 . \n the essential components of the induction have now been established . \n stages @xmath753 are analogous to stage @xmath74 , while stages @xmath754 are analogous to stage @xmath75 . in each stage @xmath76 \n , concatenations of the ( inverses of ) the partial interval bijections at stage @xmath755 are glued together using definition [ overlapconcatenation2 ] . \n given a level @xmath643 , proposition [ stage4matchingprop ] guarantees that @xmath756 is a level in @xmath277 that does not depend on which @xmath757 is used . \n moreover , proposition [ stage4matchingprop ] holds in every stage @xmath72 , which permits us to define @xmath758 to be the restriction of @xmath759 to @xmath606 . \n similarly , for @xmath73 , we can define @xmath760 to be the restriction of @xmath761 to @xmath606 . \n given @xmath72 and @xmath762 , let @xmath763 denote the unique @xmath398-canonical cylinder in @xmath3 that contains @xmath764 . \n let @xmath765 be the set of @xmath762 such that @xmath766 for infinitely many @xmath31 . \n similarly , given

many @xmath31 . \n the sets @xmath770 and @xmath771 are @xmath11 sets of full measure .    by proposition [ independenceofgoodsets ] , the sets @xmath606 for @xmath72 are independent with respect to @xmath224 . \n therefor @xmath772 by the borel - cantelli lemma . moreover , the sets @xmath606 are open , so @xmath770 is a @xmath11 subset of @xmath3 . \n the argument for @xmath771 is similar . \n

@xmath781 .    given @xmath782 , the map @xmath624 at stage @xmath783 is an extension of a concatenation of the maps @xmath624 at stage @xmath31 \n it follows that @xmath784 where , depending on the context , @xmath57 refers either to the map @xmath785 or to the map @xmath786 . \n the argument when @xmath73 is nearly identical . \n given @xmath787 , let @xmath788 be the increasing sequence of

        "abstract": "The article explores 'nearly continuous Kakutani equivalence,' a refined relation in ergodic theory where systems are compared both measurably and topologically. The study extends even Kakutani equivalence by introducing continuity on invariant subsets of full measure. Using new combinatorial tools like templates, the paper demonstrates that the Morse minimal substitution system is nearly continuously Kakutani equivalent to the binary odometer. This result strengthens the connection between measurable and topological dynamics, offering a framework for further studies in systems with zero entropy and finite rank transformations."

        "article": "the vast majority ( perhaps all ) of stars are formed in a clustered fashion . however , only a very small percentage of older stars are found in bound clusters . \n these two observations highlight the importance of clusters in the star - formation process and the significance of cluster disruption . \n the process of cluster disruption begins soon after , or concurrent with , cluster formation . \n @xcite found that @xmath3 of stars formed in embedded clusters end up in bound clusters after @xmath4  yr . \n @xcite and @xcite have shown that at least 20% , but perhaps all , star formation in the merging antennae galaxies is taking place in clusters , the majority of which are likely to become unbound . \n the case is similar in m51 , with @xmath5 of all young ( @xmath6  myr ) clusters likely to be destroyed within the first 10s of myr of their lives @xcite . on longer timescales , @xcite and \n @xcite noted a clear lack of older ( @xmath7  few gyr ) open clusters in the solar neighbourhood and @xcite found a strong absence of older clusters in m51 , m33 , smc , and the solar neighbourhood . \n the lack of old open clusters in the solar neighbourhood is even more striking when compared with the lmc , which contains a significant number of ` blue globular clusters ' with ages well in excess of a gyr ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n this difference can be understood either as a difference in the formation history of clusters or as a difference in the disruption timescales . \n this later scenario was suggested by @xcite , who directly compared the age distribution of galactic open clusters and the smc cluster population . \n he noted that there are @xmath8 times more clusters with an age of 1 gyr in the smc as compared to the solar neighbourhood ( when normalising both populations to an age of @xmath9  yr ) and concluded that disruption mechanisms must be less efficient in the smc . \n much theoretical work has gone into the later scenario , with both analytic and numerical models of cluster evolution predicting a strong influence of the galactic tidal field on the dissolution of star clusters ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . \n only recently has there been a large push to understand cluster disruption from an observational standpoint in various external potentials , making explicit comparison with models @xcite . \n we direct the reader to the review by larsen in these proceedings for a historical look at the observations and theory of cluster disruption .      while cluster disruption is a gradual process with several different disruptive agents at work \n simultaneously , one can distinguish three general phases of cluster mass loss and disruption . \n as we will see , a large fraction of clusters gets destroyed during the _ primary _ phase . \n the main phases and corresponding typical timescales of cluster disruption are : _ \n i ) infant mortality _ ( @xmath0  yr ) , _ ii ) stellar evolution _ \n ( @xmath1  yr ) and _ iii ) tidal relaxation _ ( @xmath2  yr ) . during all three phases \n there are additional tidal external perturbations from e.g. giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , the galactic disc and spiral arms that heat the cluster and speed up the process of disruption . \n however , these external perturbations operate on longer timescales for cluster populations and so are most important in phase iii . in fig . \n [ fig0 ] we schematically illustrate the three phases of disruption and the involved time - scales . \n note that the number of disruptive agents decreases in time .    in this review \n we will focus on the physics and observations of phase i as well as on recent population studies aimed at understanding phases ii and iii on a statistical basis . \n for a recent review on the physics of phases ii and iii , we refer the reader to @xcite .        before proceeding , it is worthwhile to consider our definition of a cluster \n . @xcite defines a cluster to be a _ gravitationally bound _ \n stellar association which will survive for 1020 crossing times . \n this definition implies that the stars provide enough gravitational potential to bind the cluster and ignores the role of gas in the early evolution of clusters . in this review \n , we will define a cluster as a collection of gas and stars which was _ initially gravitationally bound_. the reason for this definition will become evident in section  [ infantmortality ] \n recent studies on the populations of young star clusters in m51 @xcite and the antennae galaxies @xcite have shown a large excess of star clusters with ages less than @xmath1010  myr with respect to what would be expected assuming a constant cluster formation rate . \n the fact that open clusters in the solar neighbourhood display a similar trend @xcite has led to the conclusion that this is a physical effect and not simply that we are observing these galaxies at a special time in their star - formation history . \n if one adopts this view , then we are forced to conclude that the majority ( between 60 - 90% ) of star clusters become unbound when the remaining gas ( i.e. gas that is left - over from the star formation process ) is expelled . \n these clusters will survive less than a few crossing times . \n suppose that a star cluster is formed out of a sphere of gas with an efficiency @xmath11 , where @xmath12 . \n further suppose that the gas and stars are initially in virial equilibrium . \n if we define the virial parameter as @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the kinetic energy and @xmath15 the potential energy , virial equilibrium implies @xmath16 . \n finally , suppose that the remaining gas is removed on a timescale faster than the crossing time of stars in the cluster . \n in such a scenario the cluster is left in a super - virial state after the gas removal , with @xmath17 , and the star cluster will expand since the binding energy is too low for the stellar velocities \n . the expanding cluster will reach virial equilibrium after a few crossing times , but only after a ( possibly large ) fraction of the stars have escaped . \n this process has been shown to remove a significant amount of the stellar mass of a cluster , and if @xmath18 the entire cluster will become unbound on a timescale of 10s of myr @xcite . \n rapid gas removal of the type discussed above leaves distinct observables . in figure  [ fig1 ] \n we show the surface brightness profiles of three young clusters ( left panels ) as well as two results of @xmath19-body simulations ( right panels ) of clusters including the effects of rapid gas removal . \n all three young clusters show an excess of light at large radii with respect to the best fitting eff  @xcite or @xcite profiles . \n this is in good agreement with the predictions of the simulations , in which an unbound halo of stars is removed ( although still appearing to be associated with the cluster for 10s of myr ) due to the rapid change of the gravitational potential @xcite . \n such excess light at large radii has also been found in young clusters in the antennae galaxies @xcite . \n @xcite show that for values of @xmath11 of 0.1 and 0.6 , clusters will lose 75% and 10% of the stellar mass respectively within the first @xmath20  myr of their lives . \n thus we see that this is an extremely efficient way to rapidly disperse stars from young clusters into the field . \n this mechanism provides a natural explanation for the observed diffuse uv light in the field of starburst galaxies @xcite and supports the scenario of these authors that this light is due to rapidly dispersing young clusters . \n whether or not a cluster survives this phase , and hence more than 1020 crossing times , is largely dependent on the star - formation efficiency of the gmc core in which the cluster formed . \n thus , two clusters with exactly the same parameters ( radius , mass , metallicity , external potential field , etc ) may experience two radically different evolutionary paths if their star - formation efficiencies are different . @xcite \n have used the internal dynamical properties of young clusters in order to estimate their @xmath11-values . \n no clear trend of @xmath11 on cluster ( stellar ) mass or radius was found . \n -body simulations which include the rapid removal of gas which was left over from a non-100% star - formation efficiency ( right ) . \n the solid ( red ) and dashed ( blue ) lines are the best fitting eff  @xcite and king  @xcite profiles respectively . \n note the excess of light at large radii with respect to the best fitting eff profile in both the observations and models . \n this excess light is due to an unbound expanding halo of stars caused by the rapid ejection of the remaining gas after the cluster forms . \n _ hence , excess light at large radii strongly implies that these clusters are not in dynamical equilibrium . _ for details of the modeling and observations see @xcite and @xcite.,height=340 ]      even if a cluster survives the gas removal phase , this phase can significantly effect the observed properties of the cluster . \n hence , deducing the initial properties of a cluster from its current state is not trivial . @xcite \n have noted the strong effect of residual gas removal on inferring the initial stellar mass of a cluster , while @xcite have refined the mass loss estimates and shown that measurements of the current radii of young clusters may not reflect the initial nor the final value . \n additionally , @xcite show that this effect can mimic stellar imf variations in young clusters . \n the clusters that have survived the gas removal phase are subject to disruption phases ii and iii (   [ subsec : phases ] ) as well as tidal effects . \n disruption due to these effects can be studied on individual clusters , of which the recent observations of the dissolving globular clusters palomar 5 @xcite are probably the most spectacular example . however , \n much can be learned by approaching this problem from a cluster population point of view . \n suppose that clusters are formed continuously with a constant cluster formation rate ( a constraint which we can relax later ) . \n also , we will assume that we know the cluster initial mass function ( here taken to be a power law of the form @xmath21 with @xmath22 ( e.g.  @xcite ) and that clusters can be detected down to a known magnitude limit . \n finally , we will assume that the disruption time of a cluster depends on the cluster mass , such that more massive clusters survive longer ( on average ) than lower mass clusters . \n for this final assumption we will adopt a function of the form :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the disruption time of a @xmath25 cluster and @xmath26 @xcite . \n the beauty of this formulation is that it only has two variables , @xmath24 and @xmath27 , and as we will see , provides extremely good fits to observations . \n the formulation provided above , when combined with the given assumptions , allows for the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath27 to be found from age and mass distributions of clusters . the first survey using this technique \n was carried out by @xcite on cluster populations in m51 , m33 , the smc , and the solar neighbourhood . \n they made a _ sudden disruption _ \n assumption , meaning that the cluster is in the sample with its initial mass until , when it is disrupted . \n the somewhat surprising result from this study was that , while @xmath27 had more or less the same value in all environments studied ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath24 varied by over two orders of magnitude , with values of @xmath29  myr in the central regions of m51 to @xmath30  gyr in the smc .    the simple _ sudden disruption _ \n assumption was improved in a more recent model by @xcite , where a gradual loss of cluster mass was implemented . \n they assumed that the cluster mass decreases exponentially with a time - scale that decreases as the cluster mass decreases . \n this is done by saying that the mass loss per unit time ( ) relates to  as :    @xmath31    with @xmath32 from eq . \n [ eq : ihavebeentypingthisequationtoomuchinmylife ] . \n this very simple analytical description for cluster mass loss shows remarkably good agreement when compared to the mass loss following from the detailed @xmath19-body simulations of @xcite . in fig . \n [ dm_lamers ] we show a direct comparison of @xmath33 from the @xmath19-body simulations of clusters with different density profiles and on different orbits ( left ) and the above mentioned analytical model of @xcite ( right ) .    in both graphs the time is normalised to  and only the mass loss due to stars escaping the cluster is shown , i.e. mass loss due to stellar evolution ( sev ) is not shown . \n in addition , there is a coupling between the two types of mass loss : if stars loose mass , the cluster will expand and more stars are pushed over the tidal boundary . \n the simulations of @xcite considered sev , therefore , their  results shown in fig .  [ dm_lamers ] do include tidal induced by sev . \n for this reason we can simply add the mass loss due to sev , taken from an ssp model , to eq .  [ eq : dm ] . \n -body simulations of clusters with different number of stars , different concentration and on different orbits ( left ) . \n the mass loss due to stellar evolution is not shown . in the right panel the analytical model of @xcite is shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=255]-body simulations of clusters with different number of stars , different concentration and on different orbits ( left ) . the mass loss due to stellar evolution is not shown . \n in the right panel the analytical model of @xcite is shown.,title=\"fig:\",width=255 ]    in a series of follow - up works , it has been shown that the similarity of the value of @xmath27 in various environments strongly implies a uniformity in the cluster disruption process , while the varying values of @xmath24 is due to the different tidal field strengths _ ( and gas contents ) _ of the galaxies studied . \n galaxies with strong tidal fields , as , for example , derived from their rotation curves , having shorter disruption times @xcite . \n comparison with results of realistic @xmath19-body models performed by @xcite have placed this empirical disruption law on a solid physical footing @xcite . \n @xcite have also derived a formula for the predicted mass and age distributions of cluster samples that includes both stellar evolution and disruption for any star formation history . \n @xcite inserted the lamers disruption law into a cluster population synthesis model . \n this method has two distinct advantages over the earlier formulations . \n the first is that it removes the requirement of a constant cluster formation rate , and second , it uses the age and mass distributions together to find @xmath27 and @xmath24 . \n the case of m51 is shown in fig . \n one first begins by constructing an observed number density grid in age - mass space ( upper - left panel where the shading corresponds to the logarithm of the number of clusters found within that cell ) . \n then one generates a large number of models with different values of @xmath24 , @xmath27 , ( time dependent ) cluster formation rates , etc . and compares these models with the observed grid . \n the resultant @xmath34 diagram is shown in the bottom panel of fig . \n the best fit model is shown in the top right panel of fig . \n [ fig2 ] .    this cluster population synthesis ( cps ) \n technique , also used in a similar way by @xcite to derive the properties of the cluster population in the galaxy ngc  3627 , holds great promise in disentangling the myriad of effects present in cluster populations . in principle , the dependences of cluster size , galactocentric radius , star - formation efficiency dependent infant mortality rates , or alternative cluster disruption models can be taken into account by this technique . \n for this technique to be fully exploited one needs large samples of cluster populations with known ages and masses . \n datasets suitable for these kind of studies are beginning to be collected and released . \n several face - on spiral galaxies have been imaged in multiple filters with the high resolution / wide field _ \n hst / acs _ camera ( e.g @xcite for m101 and for m51 ) .     and @xmath24 . \n * bottom : * the @xmath34 diagram in @xmath27-@xmath24 space . \n the best fitting model is marked with an x , while the accepted fits ( @xmath35 ) are shaded . \n reproduced from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] and @xmath24 . \n * bottom : * the @xmath34 diagram in @xmath27-@xmath24 space . \n the best fitting model is marked with an x , while the accepted fits ( @xmath35 ) are shaded . \n reproduced from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   and @xmath24 . \n * bottom : * the @xmath34 diagram in @xmath27-@xmath24 space . \n the best fitting model is marked with an x , while the accepted fits ( @xmath35 ) are shaded . \n reproduced from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]      it is worth noting possible objections to the lamers disruption law . \n the first comes from @xcite who find that in the antennae galaxies the number of clusters decreases in time ( @xmath36 ) as @xmath37 , independent of cluster mass . \n this may be explained if the disruption timescale @xmath24 due to tidal field effects ( e.g. phase ii & iii ) is greater than or similar to the maximum age in the sample . \n the cluster disruption due to tidal effects would not yet be present in the @xcite sample , instead the decrease in cluster numbers would be the result of infant mortality and the fading of clusters . \n studies of infant mortality in m51 also suggest that the effect is mass independent @xcite . \n in fact , if infant mortality was not ( mostly ) independent of cluster mass we would expect the embedded cluster mass function to be significantly different from the optically selected cluster mass function .    in fig . \n [ fig : mf ] we show the dependence of the mass function slope of a multiple age cluster population on the ratio of the @xmath38 and the maximum age of the cluster in the sample ( ) . \n clusters were created continuously over 1 gyr with an initial mass function of a power - law with index @xmath39 . \n the lamers disruption law was applied in the same way as in @xcite . \n the important thing to take away from this figure is that as  approaches and exceeds  the mass function is less affected by disruption and so it retains its initial form , i.e. the right panel in fig . \n [ fig : mf ] probably applies to the @xcite sample .    ) \n .,height=151 ]    a second observation seemingly contradicting the lamers disruption law is that of @xcite who find an intermediate age ( @xmath40  gyr ) globular cluster in m33 . in m33 , \n @xcite find a @xmath24 value of @xmath41  myr , implying a disruption time of @xmath42  gyr for a @xmath43 cluster . \n however , as the authors note , the value of @xmath24 derived by @xcite was presumably of the thin disk of the galaxy , and if the intermediate - age cluster is part of the thick - disk or halo of the galaxy then the expected value of @xmath24 would be significantly larger than that quoted . additionally , it should also be noted that the mass derived by @xcite is the _ present _ mass of the cluster . \n the cluster presumably started with a much higher mass and disruptive effects have brought this cluster into its current state . \n if the present mass of the cluster is @xmath44  , then its initial mass ( after infant weight loss ) would have been @xmath45  ( assuming an age of 5  gyr ) , using the value of @xmath24 for m33 given by @xcite . \n -body models of @xcite ) disruption time of a @xmath46 cluster , @xmath24 , as a function of the mean density @xmath47 in @xmath48pc@xmath49 of the host galaxy . reproduced from @xcite.,width=340 ]    as more and more galaxies ( and environments ) \n have their characteristic disruption timescales measured , it is useful to compare the results to @xmath19-body models in order to check for consistency between the two . \n this was done in @xcite who compared the @xmath24 values derived for the smc , m33 , m51 and the solar neighbourhood to the @xmath19-body models of @xcite and @xcite which sample a large range in the ambient densities of the host galaxies . \n their results , shown in fig . \n [ fig3 ] , are intriguing . while the predicted and observed disruption time of the smc are in excellent agreement , the disruption times of the galaxy , m33 and m51 are observed to be much shorter than predicted by @xmath19-body models . \n this result is particularly surprising given the fact that the mass loss predictions of a single cluster are in excellent agreement between the lamers empirical description and that given by @xmath19-body models ( @xcite and fig . \n [ dm_lamers ] ) . \n = @xmath46 with @xmath50 . * \n top : * the motion of the gmc is along the x -

gmc encounter ( from @xcite ) . \n the parameters of this run are for typical open clusters and gmcs in the solar neighbourhood . \n the top panels show an edge - on view for five different time steps , while the bottom panels show a view along the trajectory of the gmc . \n encounters with gmcs present the most important external perturbation which cause mass loss of star in clusters . \n @xcite find that  due to encounters with gmcs scales as    @xmath53    where @xmath54 for the solar neighbourhood and @xmath55 scales with the surface density of individual gmcs ( @xmath56 ) and the global gmc density ( @xmath57 ) as @xmath58 . \n the scaling of @xmath55 with @xmath57 implies that it does not matter if the molecular gas is distributed over a large number of low mass clouds or a small number of massive ( giant ) clouds . \n this makes it easy to estimate  from the observed molecular gas density . \n indeed , for m51 , where the molecular gas density is about an order of magnitude higher than in the solar neighbourhood , a  from eq . \n [ eq : tdis_gmcs ] of 150  myr is predicted . \n this corresponds well with the value derived from observations of @xmath59  myr @xcite . \n note that eq . \n [ eq : tdis_gmcs ] implies a scaling of  with the cluster density ( @xmath60 ) . \n this seems different than the dependence with  discussed before . \n however , there is only a very shallow relation observed between cluster half - mass radius ( ) and , of the form @xmath61 @xcite . with this relation , and eq . \n [ eq : tdis_gmcs ] , it follows that for external perturbations @xmath62 , i.e. very close to the index of @xmath63 found from observations discussed in   [ subsec : appl_pops ] . \n this suggests that the disruptive effect of the tidal field and additional external perturbations can be added linearly , resulting in a  that depends on  as @xmath64 . \n this can explain the large variation found in the @xmath38 value derived from observations and the almost constant @xmath65 @xcite . in   [ sec : discussion \n ] we discuss some of the pitfalls of these results . \n as seen in the proceeding sections , the observed disruption time of star clusters in the solar neighbourhood is a factor of @xmath66 shorter than predicted by @xmath19-body models . \n the inclusion of spiral arm passages and gmc encounters into @xmath19-body models is a promising way to bring the predictions into agreement with the observations . \n this was recently done by @xcite who found excellent agreement after the inclusion gmc encounters and spiral arm passages . \n they assume that the different mass loss effects ( stellar evolution , tidal field and external perturbations ) can be added linearly . using the mass - radius relation of \n [ subsec : tdis_external ] and the results from @xcite and @xcite they analytically model the mass loss due to different effects analytically . \n this is illustrated in the left panel of fig . \n [ fig5 ] ( from @xcite ) . based on this mass loss description , \n the age distribution of open clusters in the solar neighbourhood can be predicted ( instead of fitted , as was done hitherto ) . \n the results are shown in the right panel of fig . \n [ fig5 ] .     cluster due to various disruptive effects . * \n right : * comparison between the observed age distribution of open clusters ( from ) and the predictions from @xcite for three different maximum masses . \n , title=\"fig:\",width=255 ] cluster due to various disruptive effects . * \n right : * comparison between the observed age distribution of open clusters ( from ) and the predictions from @xcite for three different maximum masses . , title=\"fig:\",width=255 ] \n we showed in \n [ sec : populations]&[sec : external ] that the simple lamers disruption law can successfully explain the age and mass distribution of young star clusters populations . here \n we will discuss other observations lending support to the lamers law and some of the standing problems and uncertainties of this scenario which need further attention .        @xcite use a variety of studies to look at the cluster population of the lmc . \n they also find a lack of old clusters ( with respect to what would be expected from a continuous cluster formation rate ) and derive @xmath67 , again in agreement with other galaxies studied by @xcite and @xcite . \n note that a lower value of @xmath27 is expected to be observed when the typical  is of the same order as the oldest clusters in the sample ( fig . \n [ fig : mf ] ) , as is the case in lmc .    outside the local group , the strongly interacting galaxy ngc \n 6745 has been studied by @xcite who found evidence for mass dependent disruption , with @xmath68 . \n the rich cluster system of the intermediate - age merger remnant ngc  1316 shows a clear bimodal colour distribution , with the red component presumably being formed during the merger . \n @xcite showed , using deep _ hst - acs _ images that if one breaks the red component into ` inner ' and ` outer ' regions ( with respect to the galactic centre ) , that the outer region is a continuous power - law while the inner region shows a power - law behavior at the high luminosity end and a flattening at the low luminosity end . \n the authors interpret this as evidence for mass - dependent cluster disruption , although no attempt was made to find the characteristic disruption timescale or the value of @xmath27 . \n one standing problem with the lamers disruption law , also present in other studies on disruption , is whether or not an initial power - law cluster initial mass function ( cimf ) can be transformed into a log - normal distribution , which is observed for old globular cluster populations . \n the lamers law can create such a turnover , however the precise value of the turnover mass should be dependent on the ambient density @xcite , meaning that cluster disruption should be more efficient in the inner regions of a galaxy than in the outer regions . \n thus , without fine tuning the models ( e.g. having the same disruption time at all radii due to large radially dependent velocity anisotropies ) one would expect a radially dependent turnover peak in the globular cluster mass function , which is not observed . for a more detailed description of this problem , \n see the review by larsen in these proceedings . \n additionally , as noted by @xcite the lamers disruption over - predicts the number of low - mass clusters when applied to old globular cluster populations . \n in   [ subsec : tdis_external ] we showed that the scaling of with  is a power - law with exponent @xmath63 . \n this scaling is similar for two - body evaporation in a tidal field with external perturbations , such as shocks by gmcs and spiral arms , and agrees well with the observations . \n however , there are still some caveats in the theory explaining this , mostly coming from questions regarding the initial conditions of the simulations .    1 . \n the first caveat stems from the relation between initial mass and radius of the clusters used in the simulations . \n if we parameterize this relation as  @xmath69 @xmath70 , then @xcite use @xmath71 , implying that their clusters fill their tidal radius . \n however , observations imply that @xmath72 ( with a large scatter ) @xcite , implying that  is mostly independent of mass . \n this shallow relation implies that massive clusters are not filling their tidal radius , which would change the dependence of  with  @xcite . \n 2 .   in the derivation of @xmath27 for external shocks (   [ subsec : tdis_external ] ) , only clusters in isolation were considered . \n how would the presence of a tidal field affect this result ? 3 . \n how does the relation for  change if there exists a relation between the concentration parameter and mass of a cluster ( i.e. as seen in the galactic gcs reported by larsen in these proceedings ) ? 4 . \n could an initial mass - radius relation with @xmath73 be erased during the gas removal phase ? \n what is the effect of the initial mass / luminosity profile used in the simulations and how does it evolve ? \n e.g. are clusters born with eff profiles which are converted into king profiles ? does the cluster concentration alter its mass loss evolution ? 6 . \n how do the external perturbations and the galactic tidal field cooperate ? \n can the mass loss due to both effects simply be added linearly ? \n barmby , p. , kuntz , k.  d. , huchra , j.  p. , & brodie , j.  p.  2006 \n , , 132 , 883 bastian , n. & goodwin , s.p . \n 2006 , mnras , 369 , l9 bastian , n. , gieles , m. , lamers , h.j.g.l.m . , \n scheepmaker , r. a. , & de grijs , r.  2005 , a&a 431 , 905 baumgardt , h. , & makino , j. 2003 , mnras , 340 , 227 baumgardt , h. 2006 : globular clusters : guides to galaxies ( astro -

        "abstract": "Star clusters face disruption through three phases: infant mortality, stellar evolution, and tidal relaxation, influenced by external tidal forces. Infant mortality occurs when gas expulsion destabilizes clusters, dispersing stars. Observations and models, including Lamers’ disruption law, explain cluster lifespans and mass distributions, linking shorter lifespans to stronger galactic tidal fields. Interactions with giant molecular clouds and spiral arms further accelerate mass loss. While Lamers’ law aligns well with observations, challenges remain, such as explaining globular cluster distributions and varying initial conditions. Recent advancements refine understanding of cluster evolution across different galactic environments."

        "article": "information encoded in qubits can be used for reliable quantum communication or efficient quantum computing @xcite . \n this information is encoded in a quantum state @xmath4 which in the case of a qubit can be parameterized as |(,)= |0 + e^i |1 ; [ 1 ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are basis vectors of the 2-dimensional space of the qubit and @xmath7 ; @xmath8 . \n qubits are very fragile , that is the state of a qubit can easily be changed by the influence of the environment or a random error . \n one ( very inefficient ) way to protect the quantum information encoded in a qubit is to measure it . with the help of an optimal measurement one \n can estimate the state of a qubit , with an average fidelity equal to 2/3 ( see below ) . in this way a quantum information is transformed into a classical information which can be stored , copied , and processed according the laws of classical physics with arbitrarily high precision . \n however , in order to utilize the full potential of quantum information processing we have to keep the information in states of quantum systems , but then we are forced to face the problem of decoherence . \n recently it has been proposed that quantum information and quantum information processing can be stabilized via symmetrization @xcite . in particular , the qubit in an unknown state is entangled with a set of @xmath1 ( ancilla ) qubits in a specific reference state ( let us say @xmath5 ) so the symmetric state @xmath9 of @xmath10 qubits , |(|,0  ,0+|0,,  ,0+  + |0,0 ,  ) , [ 2 ] is generated . \n if we introduce a notation for completely symmetric states @xmath11 of @xmath10 qubits with @xmath12 of them being in the state @xmath6 and @xmath13 of them in the state @xmath5 , then the state ( [ 2 ] ) can be expressed in the simple form |(,|)= |n;0 + e^i| |n;1[3 ] where the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are specified by the relations =  ; [ 4 ] and @xmath16 , while @xmath17 . \n we see that symmetric @xmath10 qubit state @xmath18 is isomorphic to a single qubit state . \n but in this case the information is spread among @xmath10 entangled qubits - the original quantum information is `` diluted '' . \n each of the qubits of the @xmath10-qubit state ( [ 3 ] ) is in the state @xmath19 . \n we define the average fidelity between the single state @xmath20 and the original qubit @xmath21 as = d(;)|_j(,| ) |(;)[5 ] where @xmath22 is the invariant measure on the state space of the original qubit ( i.e. we assume no _ prior _ knowledge about the pure state @xmath21 ) . for this fidelity \n we find the expression _ 0 = . \n [ 5a ] we see that for @xmath23 the fidelity @xmath24 is equal to unity ( as it should , because in this case @xmath25 ) while in the limit @xmath26 we find @xmath27 . \n in fact in this limit density operators of individual qubits are approximately equal to @xmath28 . in other words , \n individually the qubits of the symmetric state @xmath18 in the large @xmath10 limit do not carry any information about the original single - qubit state @xmath29 . \n so how can we extract the information from the @xmath10-qubit symmetric state ( [ 3 ] ) ? \n the ideal possibility would be to have have a perfect _ universal _ disentangler which would perform a unitary transformation    type of disentangling transformation @xcite .    while the perfect transformation is impossible , there are a number of things we can do to concentrate the information from the @xmath10-qubit state @xmath18 back into a single qubit . in principle , we have the following possibilities : * i ) * we can either optimally measure the @xmath10 qubit state and based on the information obtained prepare a single - qubit state . * \n ii ) * we can design a quantum disentangler which would perform a transformation as close as possible to the ideal disentangling ( [ 7 ] ) . in this quantum scenario \n we have several options - the process of disentanglement can be input - state dependent . \n this means that states ( [ 3 ] ) for some values of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath30 will be disentangled better than for other values of these parameters . \n alternatively , we can construct a quantum device which disentangles all the state with the same fidelity . \n * iii ) * finally , we propose a probabilistic disentangler , such that when a specific projective measurement over an ancilla is performed at the output , the desired single - qubit state is generated . \n the probability of the outcome of the measurement in this case is state - dependent . in what follows \n we shall investigate all these possibilities .    before proceeding we note that a different type of disentangler has been considered by terno and mor @xcite - @xcite . \n they considered two different operations . \n the first would take the state of a bipartite quantum system and transform it into a state that is just the product of the reduced density matrixes of the two subsystems . the second , which is a generalization of the first , would again start with a state of a bipartate quantum system , and map it into a separable state which has the same reduced density matrixes as the original state . \n they showed that while both of these processes are impossible in general , they can be realized for particular sets of input states . \n an approximate disentangler of the first type has been considered by bandyopadhyay , et . \n al .  @xcite . \n the disentanglers we are considering extract , to some degree of approximation , an unknown state from an entangled state formed from that state and a known state . \n here we first describe a measurement scenario utilizing a set of specific projection operators \n . then we present the optimal measurement - based approach to quantum disentanglement and we derive an upper bound on the fidelity of the measurement - based disentangler . \n we utilize the fact that the @xmath10 qubit system prepared in the state @xmath18 is isomorphic to a single qubit . \n therefore we first consider a strategy based on a a projective measurement with two projectors @xcite @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) with |_0(,)&= &     @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where the angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 are chosen randomly if no _ \n prior _ information about the measured @xmath10-qubit state is available . \n we can use the result of the measurement to manufacture a a single - qubit state . specifically , \n if the result of the measurement is positive for @xmath37 then the single qubit is prepared in the state    @xmath38 then the single qubit is prepared in the orthogonal state @xmath39 . for a particular orientation of the measurement apparatus ( i.e. the angles @xmath40 ) this measurement - based scenario gives us a single qubit prepared in the state described by the density operator ^(meas ) ( , |;,)= _ \n j=0 ^ 1 ||_j|^2 |_j_j| [ 9 ] after we average over all possible orientations of the measurement apparatus we obtain on average a single qubit prepared in the state ^(est ) ( , |)= |(,|)(,|)| + . [ 10 ] to find the average fidelity of this measurement - based disentangling procedure we have to evaluate the mean fidelity @xmath41 , that is the overlap between the state ( [ 10 ] ) and the original input state @xmath42 averaged over all possible orientations of the input qubit : _ \n 1 = d (,)|^(est ) ( , |)| ( , ) . \n [ 11 ] taking into account the relation ( [ 4 ] ) we perform the integration in eq.([11 ] ) and we find _ 1 = ( 1+f_n ) \n [ 12 ] where the function @xmath43 reads f_n= . \n [ 6 ] for @xmath23 : @xmath44 which is the optimal fidelity of estimation of the state of a single qubit . from fig . \n [ fig1 ] we see that the fidelity ( [ 12 ] ) is a decreasing function of @xmath10 and in the limit @xmath45 we find @xmath46 , which is equal to the fidelity of a _ random _ guess associated with a binary system such as the two projectors under consideration . in other words , \n when the original qubit is diluted into an infinite qubit state of the form ( [ 3 ] ) no relevant information can be gained from the measurement . \n the estimated density operator ( [ 10 ] ) in this case is simply equal to @xmath47 , which is understandable , because as we have shown earlier in this limit the @xmath10-qubit state is approximately in the state @xmath48 , so information about the original is `` almost '' totally lost . \n we now want to find an upper bound @xmath49 for the average fidelity which can be achieved by a wide class of measurement - based disentanglement procedures . \n we assume that it is _ a priori _ known that our @xmath10-qubit is prepared in the symmetric state ( [ 2 ] ) with unknown parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 associated with a single - qubit state ( [ 1 ] ) . \n the integration measure on the state space of the single qubit is @xmath52 and the corresponding prior probability density distribution on this state space is constant .    our strategy is to measure the input state @xmath9 along the vector @xmath53 [ see eq . ( [ 8 ] ) ] , where the angles @xmath54 and @xmath55 are chosen according to the distribution @xmath56 , which will be left unspecified for the moment . if the answer is positive , we produce the output density matrix @xmath57 , and if it is negative we produce @xmath58 , where @xmath59 with @xmath32 and @xmath60 given by eq . \n ( [ 8a ] ) . \n we shall also leave the conditional probabilities , @xmath61 unspecified , as this allows us to consider a wide range of strategies . for a fixed @xmath53 , \n the probability of the output being @xmath57 is @xmath62 and the probability of it being @xmath58 is @xmath63 . \n averaging over all vectors , @xmath64 gives us ^(out)(,| ) & = & d^[|_0|    & + & |_1 ||^2_1(^,^ ) ] q(^ , ^ ) . in order to find the average fidelity of the output produced by this procedure , we compute the fidelity for a particular input state and average over the input ensemble @xmath65 where @xmath14 is a function of @xmath50 [ see eq.([4 ] ) ] . \n this can be expressed as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a normalized joint probability distribution , and @xmath68 where @xmath69 and the supremum is taken over the variables @xmath70 . \n we then have that @xmath71 , \\ ] ] where the supremum is now taken over @xmath72 and @xmath73 . \n in order to calculate this upper bound we must find explicit expressions for @xmath74 and @xmath75 . \n after performing the necessary calculations we find for @xmath49 the expression ^max= . \n this fidelity for @xmath23 is equal to 2/3 while in the limit @xmath26 is equal to 1/2 . \n for any other @xmath10 is larger than the fidelity @xmath41 of the measurement given by eq.([12 ] ) as discussed in our previous example . \n nevertheless , as we will show later it is alway smaller than the fidelity of the universal quantum device . \n in what follows we show that a quantum disentangler which preserves quantum coherences can distill the information back to a single qubit more efficiently than can the measurement - based method . as we have already said in the introduction quantum mechanics does not allow one to construct a perfect disentangler which would perform transformation ( [ 7 ] ) for an arbitrary ( unknown ) state @xmath42 diluted in the @xmath10 qubit symmetric state ( [ 3 ] ) . nevertheless , we can try to design optimal disentanglers which perform best under given constraints . \n so let us assume our quantum disentangler , @xmath76 , is a quantum system with a @xmath77-dimensional hilbert space spanned by basis vectors @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) . \n the disentangler is always initially prepared in the state @xmath80 , and then it interacts with the @xmath10-qubit system in the state ( [ 3 ] ) . at the output \n we want to disentangle the @xmath1 ancilla qubits from the original qubit , so we expect to have |(,|)|d_0|n-1;0_k=1^k _ \n j=0 ^ 1 c_j(,| ) |j|d_k . \n [ 13 ] as seen from eq.([13 ] ) during the disentanglement process the entanglement between the @xmath1 ancilla qubits and the original qubit is transferred ( swapped ) into the entanglement between the original qubit and the disentangler itself . by tracing over the disentangler \n we then expect to obtain the best possible disentangled qubit in the state @xmath81 . \n now we impose several constraints which would specify what we mean by the optimal covariant ( universal ) disentangler : the fidelity between the output of the disentangler and the original state @xmath42 has to be invariant with respect to rotations of the original qubit , so the fidelity has to be input - state independent . \n this universality of the disentangler would then guarantee that the information from the symmetric state ( [ 3 ] ) is extracted for all states equally well . \n we are looking for the _ optimal _ disentangler which would disentangle the information with the highest fidelity .    imposing these two conditions \n we have found the unitary transformation which realizes the _ optimal covariant _ disentangler , i.e. which disentangle the qubit - state @xmath29 from the @xmath10-qubit state @xmath9 in the optimal and the @xmath29-state independent way ( see appendix ) . \n this disentangler is described by the transformation : |n;0|d_0 & & |n-1;0 ; +    basis vectors of the disentangler . \n the amplitudes @xmath82 and @xmath83 given by the relation _ \n n=()^1/2 ; _ n=. [ 15 ]    we can directly verify , that the fidelity @xmath84 is input - state independent and equal to @xmath85 . moreover , it can be shown that the transformation ( [ 15 ] ) is optimal , i.e. among all unitary transformations satisfying the given conditions the transformation ( [ 15 ] ) has the largest fidelity . \n we see that for @xmath23 the fidelity @xmath86 , which is obvious , because the original qubit has not been entangled with ancilla qubits . \n we plot @xmath87 in fig . \n we see , that it is _ always _ larger than the fidelity of the disentanglement via measurement . in the limit @xmath26 even the quantum disentangler gives us a totally random outcome . \n so in this limit , even optimal quantum entangler on which we impose the universality condition , is not able to extract information from the state ( [ 3 ] ) . \n this is one of the main results of our paper - the optimal covariant quantum disentangler operates better than if the information is extracted ( disentangled , distilled ) from the symmetrized state ( [ 3 ] ) with the help the of optimal measurement . \n this is due to the fact that @xmath88 . \n one can also ask the opposite question , how can we generate out of a qubit in an unknown state @xmath29 the symmetric state of the form ( [ 3 ] ) . it can be shown that within quantum mechanics perfect universal entanglers , which would realize the inverse of the relation ( [ 7 ] ) do not exist . if one wants to create a state ( [ 3 ] ) from a qubit in an unknown state and @xmath1 ancilla qubits in the known state @xmath5 again two scenarios are possible , the measurement - based and quantum scenarios . \n it is not surprising that the quantum scenario works better . \n we have found the optimal universal ( covariant with respect to rotations of the input qubit ) quantum entangler given by the transformations : |0|n-1;0|e_0 & & ; +    basis states of the quantum entangler , @xmath89 is its initial state and the parameters @xmath90 and @xmath83 are given by eq.([15 ] ) . \n one can check that the fidelity between the output of this entangler described by the density operator @xmath91 and the ideally entangled state ( [ 3 ] ) is input - state independent ( i.e. does not depend on the parameters @xmath92 ) and is equal to @xmath93 . \n this is the best possible universal ( covariant ) entangler . \n the universal disentangler gives a higher fidelity than does the best measurement - based procedure , but it is not obvious that this is the best that one can do . in the case of quantum cloning , \n the universal cloners are the ones which maximize the average fidelity @xcite . \n as we shall see , however , in the case of disentanglers this is no longer the case ; there are state - dependent devices which are better . \n consider the general disentangler transformation     @xmath94 , are states of the disentangler itself and need not be orthogonal . \n they must , however , satisfy the constraints imposed by the unitarity of the above transformation . \n the input state for the device is assumed to be @xmath95 , and the ideal output state , to which the actual output should be compared , is @xmath96 . \n the output state is calculated by starting with the input state , using the above transformation , and then tracing over the disentangler to obtain an output density matrix , @xmath97 . \n one then finds the average fidelity for this process , which we shall call @xmath98 , from @xmath99 note that we are assuming a specific ensemble of input states ; the probability of the one - qubit state @xmath100 is assumed to be constant on the bloch sphere . \n our result for the average fidelity for a state - dependent device depends on our choice of input ensemble , while for a state - independent device the average fidelity is independent of this ensemble . \n the calculation of the average fidelity is given in the appendix , and will not be given in detail . \n we find that @xmath101 and @xmath102 . \n this implies that the final state is just a product of the state of the @xmath10 particles and the entangler state , which means that the entangler states can be dropped from the problem . \n therefore , the transformation which maximizes the average fidelity is just     a kind of state swapping transformation . \n the average fidelity itself is given by @xmath103 , where the coefficient @xmath43 is given by eq.([6 ] ) . \n this average fidelity is larger than the fidelity of the optimal _ universal _ disentangler ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . in this case , the fact that the universality condition forces us to use an additional quantum device , the disentangler , with which the qubit at the output becomes partially entangled , results in a net loss of information . as a result \n the fidelity of the universal ( covariant ) entangler is smaller . \n analogously , we find that quantum state - dependent entanglement can also be performed by a kind of state swapping transformation , i.e. |(,)|n;0|0    @xmath104 . nevertheless , when averaged over all values of @xmath105 we find the mean fidelity of this state - dependent entangler to be equal to @xmath43 which on average is larger than the fidelity of the state - independent entangler . \n let us examine a simple quantum network which takes as an input the @xmath10-qubit state ( [ 3 ] ) . \n the network is composed of a sequence of @xmath1 c - not gates @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the c - not with @xmath108 being the control bit and @xmath12 being the target bit . \n this sequence of the c - not gates acts on the two vectors @xmath109 and @xmath110 as [ 20 ] p_n|n;0 & & |n-1;0|0 + p_n |n;1 & & ( |n-1;1+|n-1;0 ) |1from which it follows that the input vector ( [ 3 ] ) is transformed as |(,| ) & & ( |v_+| ( , ) + & & + |v_-|0 ) [ 21 ] where @xmath111 is the normalization constant . in eq.([21 ] ) we have introduced two orthogonal vectors of @xmath1 qubits @xmath112 . \n measurement on the first @xmath1 qubits is performed in order to determine whether they are in the state @xmath113 or @xmath114 . if the result @xmath115 is obtained , then the @xmath10th qubit is in the desired state @xmath42 . \n the probability of this outcome is given by p_|v_+= . \n [ 23 ] this probability is input - state - dependent , and it decreases with @xmath10 .    there is a difference between this probabilistic process and those considered previously , such as probabilistic cloning @xcite . those only work for set of input states which is finite . \n the process considered above , however , works for a continuous , and hence infinite , set of input states . \n it , in fact , works for all input states of the type we are considering . \n therefore , we can conclude that the range of applicability of probabilistic devices depends on the process being considered . \n we have considered a number of different methods of extracting an unknown state from an entangled state formed from that state and a known state . \n measuring the state is , as expected , the least effective method . in the case of quantum devices , \n the universal device was not best one , at least if average fidelity is used as the criterion . \n probabilistic quantum devices were seen to work very well for this operation in that they can be used for the entire set of input states . \n this work was supported by the national science foundation under grant phy-9970507 , by the ist project equip under the contract ist-1999 - 11053 and by the crest , research team for interacting career electronics . \n let us consider the optimal quantum disentangler which acts as close as possible to the ideal transformation ( [ 7 ] ) . \n the disentangler maps the space spanned by the vectors @xmath116 and @xmath117 , into the space spanned by @xmath118 and @xmath119 . \n this suggests that we consider a transformation of the following form @xmath120 where @xmath80 is the initial state of the disentangler which is supposed to be the same for all inputs and @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) are some unnormalized disentangler state - vectors . \n our task is to determine these vectors . \n unitarity immediately implies that @xmath123 we shall now use our disentangler transformations ( a.1 ) to calculate the fidelity of the actual output to the ideal output ( [ 7 ] ) the input of the disentangler is given by eq . \n ( [ 3 ] ) . \n if we introduce a notation @xmath124 and @xmath125 we can write the result of the transformation ( a.1 ) @xmath126 we now use this expression to find the output density matrix and trace out the disentangler itself . \n we define the @xmath10-qubit output density matrix to be @xmath127 the output fidelity is given by @xmath128 where @xmath129 is given by eq . \n ( [ 7 ] ) . \n if we denote @xmath130 and @xmath131 we can express this fidelity as @xmath132   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\alpha^{\\ast}\\beta           \\langle d_{3}|d_{4}\\rangle ) \\nonumber \\\\   & + & ( \\alpha^{\\ast})^{2}\\beta^{2}\\sqrt{n}\\langle d_{2}| d_{3}\\rangle   + \\alpha^{2}(\\beta^{\\ast})^{2}\\sqrt{n } \\langle d_{3}|d_{2}\\rangle \\}. \\label{a.5 } \\eqnum{a.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        demanding that the fidelity be independent of phases of @xmath133 and @xmath134 we find that @xmath135 assuming these conditions to be satisfied the fidelity becomes @xmath136 \\ } . \n \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order for this to be independent of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , the term in brackets must be proportional to @xmath137 comparing eqs . \n ( a.7 ) and ( a.8 ) we find that @xmath138 combining these requirements with those imposed by unitarity we conclude that @xmath139 and @xmath140 . \n this means that in order to maximize @xmath141 , we must maximize @xmath142 . \n our first step in accomplishing this is to note that by combining the results of eqs . \n ( a.9 ) and ( a.10 ) we have that @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 . solving for @xmath142 we find that @xmath146 which , assuming @xmath147 , is greatest when @xmath148 . \n this implies that @xmath149 and that @xmath150 imposing now the conditions on inner products we find that @xmath151    we can summarize our results in the following way . let @xmath152 be a set of three orthonormal vectors and define two parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 given by eq . \n ( [ 15 ] ) we then have that @xmath153 and the universal _ optimal _ disentangler transformation is given explicitly by eq . \n ( [ 14 ] ) .      in order to find the optimal input - state dependent disentangler \n we find the explicit form of the transformation ( a.1 ) such that the _ averaged _ fidelity @xmath154 ( with @xmath141 given by eq . \n ( a.5 ) ) is maximized . here , as usually , the integration measure is @xmath155 . \n therefore after the integral over the phase @xmath51 is performed we can write the average fidelity as @xmath156\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with [ a.18 ] _ 1&=&_0^ ^4 + _ 2 & = & _ 0^ ^4 + _ 3&=&_0^ ^2 ^2 after the integration over the parameter @xmath50 we find [ a.19 ] _ 1&= & + _ 2&= & + _ 3&= &    from the unitarity of the disentangling transformation it follows that @xmath157 and @xmath158 . \n when we introduce the notation @xmath159 where @xmath160 , and @xmath161 ; @xmath162 we can rewrite the average fidelity ( a.17 ) as & = & [ _ 1 n ( _ 1-_3 ) + _ 4(_2-_3 ) + & + & 2_3 u + _ 3(1+n ) ] . \n [ a.21 ] taking into account that @xmath163 and @xmath164 we easily find that the maximum of the mean fidelity ( a.21 ) is achieved for @xmath165 and @xmath166 . in this case \n we rewrite ( a.21 ) as = [ _ 1 n + _ 2 + 2 _ 3 ] . \n [ a.22 ] when we substitute into eq . \n ( a.22 ) the explicit expression for the parameters @xmath167 given by eq .

        "abstract": "Disentangling an unknown qubit from a set of ancilla qubits is imperfect but can be optimized. The study evaluates various disentanglement methods, showing measurement-based approaches as least effective. The optimal universal disentangler achieves state-independent fidelity, while a probabilistic disentangler can perform perfect disentanglement with less than 100% probability. These methods balance quantum coherence preservation and fidelity, providing insights into quantum information extraction and processing challenges."

regime is side - coupled to a ring [ see fig.[fig1](a ) ] . \n our structure has a tunable channel between the ring and the dot which permits us to couple coherently the two subsystems while keeping them spatially separated and therefore minimize capacitive effects of the quantum dot on the interference in the ring , as investigated in ref and ref . \n in contrast to previous ring systems , our experiment constitutes a tunable fano scatterer consisting of one arm of the ring and the side coupled dot , which is made to interfere with alternative paths along the second arm of the ring . \n this allows us to study the interplay between continuous ab -

quality two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) 34 nm below the surface . the electron density in the 2deg was @xmath17m@xmath18 and the mobility was @xmath19m@xmath20/vs at 1.7k . \n fig.[fig1](a ) shows an afm image of the device defined using afm -

up allows us to simultaneously detect the resonance position in the dot and the interference pattern in the ring current , without changing the coupling or any additional gate voltages . \n furthermore , the magnetic field is used to tune the interference between the phase sensitive ring and the dot which , when side coupled to one arm of the ring , will act as a fano scatterer ( see below ) .      before coupling the ring and the dot coherently we assess the magnitude of the crosstalk between the structures due to the cross - coupling of the gate electrodes and direct coulomb interaction . to this end @xmath15 \n was set to -75mv in order to deplete the channel between the two structures . \n figure[fig2](a ) shows a measurement of ab - oscillations in @xmath2 when @xmath4 is used to tune the electron number @xmath34 in the dot . \n the white dotted lines show the cb - peak positions in the dot . \n the unperturbed ab - oscillations in fig.[fig2 ] indicate that unlike recently reported results @xcite we are in a regime where the direct coulomb interaction between the two structures is negligibly small . \n furthermore , the gate on the dot changes neither the characteristic amplitude nor the phase of ab - oscillations in the ring over a range @xmath35mv . \n we find that the same is true when changing @xmath36 applied to the top gate of the dot . \n the top gate electrodes _ tgr _ and _ tgd _ respectively allow us to tune the electron density in the ring or electron number in the dot over a large range without changing the coupling to source and drain strongly . however , where possible we restrict ourselves to tuning the in - plane gates , since in this case we find the structure to be more stable and the gate voltages lead to fewer charge rearrangements .    in order to couple the two structures we increase @xmath15 . \n figure[fig2](b ) shows the three currents @xmath0(dotted line ) , @xmath14(dashed line ) and @xmath1(solid line ) where thicker lines correspond to less negative @xmath15 . with stronger coupling \n , @xmath1 increases from negligible current at @xmath37mv to a value around 4pa with clear ab - oscillations at @xmath38mv . in this regime \n @xmath0 exhibits larger deviations from the perfect symmetry as a function of magnetic field @xmath28 , an effect that is expected for the transition from a two - terminal to multi - terminal system.@xcite the current @xmath14 is not significantly modified by the increase in @xmath15 except that the source - drain coupling of the dot is influenced slightly which leads to a larger current for the strongest coupling .     of the currents @xmath0 ( dotted lines ) , @xmath14(dashed lines ) and @xmath1 ( solid lines ) at @xmath39mt ( top panel ) and @xmath4030 mt ( bottom panel ) . \n the vertical dashed lines mark the peak positions . \n curves are slightly offset at @xmath4=-25mv to correct for a parametric charge rearrangement at that gate value . \n ( b ) - ( d ) gray scale plots of the currents @xmath0 ( a ) , @xmath14(b ) and @xmath1(c ) as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath4 . \n the white vertical lines are fits to the cb - peak positions in ( c ) . \n , width=326 ]    starting from this strongly coupled situation , we have optimized the amplitude of the ab - oscillations in the ring and their coupling to the cb - resonances in the dot by changing several gate voltages . \n note that specifically @xmath41 and @xmath42 were increased from 0mv to 200mv in order to optimize the interconnecting channel from the ring to the dot . in the following \n , more negative @xmath15 values are therefore required to close this channel . \n figure[fig2](c ) shows a simultaneous measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath14 when @xmath36 is tuned over a large range . \n while @xmath14 shows clear cb - oscillations the ring current depends strongly on the level alignment in the dot . \n when the dot is tuned through a resonance peak with increasing @xmath36 , @xmath0 is reduced by up to a factor of two . \n this is a manifestation of the fano effect . \n it has been shown previously that a dot which is side - coupled to a wire is a typical fano system.@xcite here we probe the properties of such a fano scatterer by embedding it in a two terminal ring structure . \n figure[fig3](a ) shows curve traces of @xmath0 and @xmath14 as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath43mt and after half an ab - period ( @xmath44mt ) . \n the vertical lines mark the positions of the cb - resonances as determined from peak fits to @xmath14 with a lorentzian line shape . increasing the flux through the ring by half a flux quantum changes @xmath0 from a behavior where a dip occurs at each gate voltage before the dot resonance to a situation where a similar asymmetric dip occurs after the dot resonance . \n figures[fig3](b)-(d ) show @xmath0 , @xmath14 and @xmath1 in gray - scale plots as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath28 . \n the dips in @xmath0 [ bright areas in fig.[fig3](b ) ] continue to oscillate back and forth for each additional flux quantum through the ring until at @xmath45mt normal ab - oscillations are recovered . \n the vertical white lines are again the peak positions determined from fits to @xmath14 shown in fig.[fig3](c ) . \n the slight peak shifts as a function of magnetic field are due to the influence of the magnetic field on individual orbital levels of the dot . from the evolution of the peak amplitude and position \n , we find that neighboring peaks show highly correlated behavior over large magnetic field ranges indicating spin pairing in the dot for the six peaks that are shown . \n as expected @xmath1 [ fig.[fig3](d ) ] is different from zero only when @xmath14 is finite . \n @xmath1 which flows through both structures oscillates around zero with the ab - period as a function of @xmath28 . \n this is in contrast to @xmath0 which has a significant @xmath28-independent background . \n we explain this by the fact that @xmath1 measures the difference between the two transmissions @xmath46 and @xmath47 and the @xmath48-contribution therefore cancels out if the structure geometry and the couplings are ideally symmetric . due to the three terminals the different ab - geometry for @xmath46 and @xmath47 retains a net ab - effect . \n we model the coherent quantum dot in the single particle , single level approximation as a closed - end resonator consisting of a 1d wire with a barrier and a perfect reflector as shown in fig . \n [ fig4](a ) . \n the unitary scattering matrix of a general barrier is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the reflection probability and @xmath51 are free phase parameters . \n the reflection amplitude of such a dot is found from a sum over all feynman paths @xmath52 t = r+\\frac{t\\lambda   r_\\mathrm{t}\\lambda t}{1-r'\\lambda r_\\mathrm{t}\\lambda}.\\ ] ] here @xmath53 describes the propagation between the barrier and the reflector and @xmath54 is the reflection amplitude at the reflector . by introducing the phase @xmath55 which an electron accumulates during a round trip in the dot , \n the total reflection amplitude becomes @xmath56 this can be rewritten as @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 . \n for this closed - end structure , the amplitude is restricted to the unit circle and resonances arise when @xmath60 , @xmath61 .    . \n ( d ) model calculation for -2 to + 1 flux quanta passing through the ring and over a change of @xmath62 in the dot phase @xmath63 . \n the parameters used were @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and all leads to the ring are assumed to be ideal beam splitters . \n ( e ) section of @xmath0 for two spin paired states . \n the white dashed lines are the peak positions extracted from fits to @xmath14 . \n , width=326 ]    the dot resonator is then side - coupled to a wire through a three terminal junction as seen in fig . \n [ fig4](b ) . \n the transmission and reflection amplitudes of the wire are @xmath67 where the amplitudes @xmath68 and @xmath69 describe the direct transmission from the entrance to the exit of the wire and the direct reflection at the entrance of the wire respectively . @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the amplitudes for transmission from the entrance into the dot and from the dot to the entrance respectively , and @xmath72 is the amplitude for transmission from the dot into the exit of the wire . \n the side - coupled dot structure can hence be mapped onto a @xmath73 transfer matrix @xmath74 as indicated in fig . \n [ fig4](b ) . \n the transmission probability of the wire with the side - coupled dot can then be shown to have the fano form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the fano parameter . for \n @xmath77 @xmath78 produces fano line shapes . \n this becomes clear when @xmath79 is approximated close to a resonance at energy @xmath80 , neglecting any energy dependence of @xmath81 . \n it follows that @xmath82 with @xmath83 giving the link to the fano formula in eq.[eqn1 ] . \n note , that the fano parameter @xmath10 in eq.[tw ] , and through it the line shape , is uniquely determined by the direct reflection phase @xmath84 of the barrier in the side - coupled dot structure , i.e. , @xmath85 produces a symmetric resonance peak ( @xmath86 ) , @xmath87 produces a symmetric dip in the transmission ( @xmath88 ) , and @xmath89 produce maximally asymmetric line shapes ( @xmath90 ) .    in the following \n we assume the three terminal junction to be a symmetric beam splitter which is described by the unitary scattering matrix  @xcite @xmath91 using this for the coupling between the dot and the wire we get @xmath92 resulting in a vanishing constant term in the transmission probability in eq . \n it follows that @xmath93 a _ fano scatterer _ is therefore characterized by the transfer matrix @xmath94 in eq.[ft ] , with the two parameters @xmath10 and @xmath79 .          the ring - dot structure in the experiment \n can now be modeled by placing the transfer matrix @xmath95 in one of the arms of the ring as shown in fig . \n [ fig4](c ) . \n the ring is attached to two ideal semi - infinite leads at the junctions 1 and 2 . \n these junctions together with the transfer matrix @xmath94 partitions the ring into three sections of equal length . when an electron wave traverses each section it acquires the fermi phase @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the fermi wave - number , as well as a magnetic phase @xmath98 ( opposite signs for clockwise and anticlockwise propagation ) where @xmath99 is the magnetic flux enclosed by the ring and @xmath100 is the magnetic flux quantum . \n these phases enter the transfer matrix for each ring section @xmath101 as indicated in fig.[fig4](c ) . with the boundary conditions on the incoming amplitudes in the source and drain \n leads @xmath102 and @xmath103 , one finds the two - terminal conductance from the landauer formula @xmath104 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 \n for comparison with the experimental data we set @xmath107 , a value which gives pronounced ab - oscillations in the ring while suppressing higher harmonics when the dot is decoupled ( r=1 ) . \n figure[fig4](d ) shows the calculated conductance @xmath108 as a function of @xmath109 and the number of flux quanta penetrating the ring with @xmath110 and @xmath66 . for comparison , \n a similar section of the measured @xmath0 as a function of b and @xmath111 is shown in fig.[fig4](e ) . \n very good agreement is found , indicating that our simple model quite accurately describes the experimental situation of the coupled ring - dot structure . \n this agreement is robust against variations in @xmath50 but sensitive to changes in @xmath84 , since @xmath84 is linked to the fano factor @xmath10 . \n we determine @xmath112 in agreement with the experimental procedure where we optimized the coupling between the ring and the dot to result in most asymmetric fano line shapes . \n the sign of the asymmetric line shape in @xmath0 is periodically tuned by the flux penetrating the ring . \n this behavior is qualitatively similar to recently reported results in ref . where a complex q was introduced in order to accommodate for the magnetic field dependence of the fano line shapes . \n however , we have not been able to transform eq.[tw ] into a form where the magnetic flux through the ring @xmath113 enters as a phase @xmath114 in a complex @xmath10-parameter and we therefore restrict ourselves to a real @xmath10-parameter reflecting only the fano effect of one arm of the ring with the side coupled dot . \n the interference properties of this fano scatterer are then probed by ab - interference in the ring . \n this is different to ref . where the whole ring structure with a dot embedded in one arm is considered as a fano scatterer . \n the @xmath10-parameter is indicative of the coupling between the dot and the ring and to further strengthen the agreement between model and experiment we tune @xmath115 successively more negative to reduce the coupling and thereby tune the @xmath10-parameter . \n figure[fig5](a ) shows @xmath0 as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath111 for decreasing values of @xmath115 from left to right . \n as the coupling is decreased @xmath0 becomes more strongly suppressed at @xmath116mt while the dips ( white areas ) at @xmath43mt seem to disappear . within our model , this can be understood assuming that a decrease in @xmath115 reduces the phase pick - up @xmath84 of the electrons traversing the interconnecting channel and therefore decreases @xmath10 from its initial value of 1 . \n in addition , the reflection probability r is likely to increase . \n figure[fig5](b ) shows @xmath108 for the same parameters as in fig.[fig4](a ) while varying @xmath10 from 1 to 0 . \n again we find good qualitative agreement with the experiment except for very small @xmath10-values where it is difficult to determine which q matches the experimental situation best . \n the last plot on the right shows @xmath108 for @xmath1170 where ab - like oscillations are found except very close to the resonance of the dot . \n this transition is more complete in the experimental data , where for @xmath118mv only small dips in @xmath0 are found .    in fig.[fig6](a ) \n traces of @xmath0 and @xmath14 as a function of @xmath4 at @xmath43mt ( solid lines ) and @xmath44mt ( dashed lines ) are plotted for @xmath119 - 68.3,-68.7,-69.1,-69.5 , and -69.9mv . \n the traces have been taken across the coulomb resonance marked with arrows in fig[fig5](a ) and for each value of @xmath15 they were shifted in @xmath4 such that the peak maximum in @xmath14 ( only @xmath43mt shown ) comes to lie at @xmath120mv . \n the topmost solid ( lowermost dashed ) line respectively mark an ab - maximum(minimum ) for @xmath119 - 69.9mv which is the most weakly coupled situation and corresponds to a @xmath121 . here \n the dip(peak)in @xmath0 close to the resonance position are more clearly visible . the behavior in fig.[fig5](b ) is qualitatively different in the calculated @xmath108 where even for @xmath122 the dip close to resonance at @xmath43 yields a sharp transmission zero for the parameters that were chosen . \n we will argue in the following that this discrepancy between model and experiment can be understood when taking into account decoherence in the dot . \n in contrast to the model , the experimental quantum dot is connected to two contacts which will lead to partial phase randomization of the electron paths visiting the quantum dot.@xcite       at @xmath123=0.1k for decreasing gate coupling tuned by @xmath119 - 68.3,-68.7,-69.1,-69.5 , and @xmath124mv . \n the curves are measured over the peak marked with an arrow in fig.[fig5 ] and for @xmath39mt ( solid lines ) , @xmath125mt ( dashed lines ) . for each value of @xmath15 \n we subtract an offset in @xmath4 in order for the peak in @xmath14 to be at @xmath126mv . \n ( b ) @xmath127 for @xmath128 and 0 including decoherence in the dot with a decoherence rate @xmath129 . \n ( c ) @xmath127 with strong decoherence in the dot using @xmath130 . \n ( d ) @xmath0 as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath28 at @xmath123=0.65k.,width=326 ]    since the observed fano resonances rely on coherent transport through the whole structure , decoherence at finite temperatures due to coupling of the structure to the environment , e.g. the source and drain leads of the dot , is important . \n we have measured the temperature dependence of the fano line shapes in @xmath0 and found that at @xmath131k the ab - oscillations in the ring persist while the fano behavior is strongly suppressed . \n this is in agreement with a picture where the paths that pass through the dot are most strongly affected by decoherence due to the fact that such a path is longer than the direct paths in the ring which do nt traverse the dot . \n furthermore , the dot paths will be influenced by decoherence induced by the two contacts attached to it . \n we follow ref . in order to include decoherence in the dot by the modification of the phase @xmath132 where @xmath133 is \n the length of the path through the dot and @xmath32 is the phase coherence length . \n this introduces a damping of the coherent channel passing through the dot . \n the `` absorbed amplitude '' is re - injected into the incoherent channel by introducing an additional term in the two - terminal conductance @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the transmission(reflection ) probability for injection in lead @xmath26 and detection in lead @xmath27 and is given by @xmath136    with    @xmath137    and @xmath138 the re - injection asserts probability conservation in the structure and hence the symmetries required by the two - terminal onsager relation . \n figure[fig6](b ) shows @xmath127 for @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 taking into account a finite phase coherence length @xmath145 . \n the solid lines are again for @xmath146 and the dashed lines for @xmath147 . \n the gray solid line shows the line shape for @xmath122 in the fully coherent case for comparison . \n decoherence leads , as expected , to broadening of the fano line shapes and to strong amplitude reduction , a fact which has been suggested to be used as a measure for decoherence in a quantum dot in the fano regime@xcite . \n the close resemblance to the measured data at @xmath148mk [ fig.[fig6](a ) ] suggests that even at these low temperatures the contacts to the quantum dot lead to decoherence of paths entering the quantum dot from the ring , hence , a modification of the fano effect which we measure in @xmath0 . \n however , the deviation from the fully coherent limit is strongest in the regime of weak coupling between the two structures close to @xmath122 . \n the experimental traces show a reduction in oscillation - amplitude ( separation between solid and dashed curve ) of about 20% close to resonance , while @xmath127 exhibits a reduction which is more than twice as large . \n we believe that in the real structure both the reflection probability @xmath50 and the decoherence rate increase as the coupling between the ring and the dot is decreased . for weaker coupling , \n the time an electron spends in the dot becomes larger and this means that close to the dot resonance its probability for tunneling into one of the contacts of the dot becomes larger . \n we have adjusted the parameters in the model accordingly and find good agreement for @xmath149 and @xmath150 ( not shown ) . \n note , that the cross - coupling of @xmath15 has the opposite effect and the coulomb peak width in @xmath14 decreases for decreasing @xmath115 . \n for @xmath64 the effect of decoherence due to the dot contacts is small since we expect strong coherent coupling between the two structures . \n this can be seen from the good agreement between @xmath127 and @xmath0 for this situation . \n when the temperature is increased decoherence becomes important also for the @xmath64 case and the fano effect is almost completely lost at @xmath151 . \n figure[fig6](c ) shows @xmath127 for @xmath149 , @xmath152 , @xmath64 and @xmath153 . \n these parameters were chosen such as to resemble the data in fig.[fig6](d ) measured at @xmath151 . using the dimensions of the ring dot structure we estimate a phase coherence length @xmath154 nm at this temperature . \n the decoherence of paths through the dot strongly suppresses the asymmetric line shapes , leading to an ab pattern in the conductance . \n this clearly links the observed asymmetric line shapes to the interaction between discrete states formed in the dot and continuous states of the ring and further strengthens our explanation in terms of the fano effect . \n the scattering model clearly reproduces all the characteristic features of the experimental data but has a few obvious limitations . \n while we restrict decoherence to the dot , a more accurate model would include both thermal averaging as well as decoherence in the dot , the ring and the interconnecting arm . using \n thermal averaging alone we were not able to reproduce the experimental data at finite temperature and the inclusion of decoherence in the ring and the interconnecting arm did not improve the model . \n we therefore restricted ourselves to decoherence as discussed above and speculate that the additional leads on the dot are the main source for decoherence of the fano effect . \n the model only treats a two - terminal geometry which neglects effects of the two contacts on the dot in terms of the symmetry of the current as a function of @xmath28 . \n this means that the model also assumes that there are no net currents flowing from the dot to the ring ( @xmath155 ) . from the simultaneous measurements of @xmath1 we estimate this contribution to be about two times smaller than the dips ( peaks ) in @xmath0 for @xmath122 and \n we are therefore led to believe that it has little influence on @xmath0 . however , where the current through the dot is suppressed at larger magnetic fields [ e.g. , in the lower left corner in fig.[fig3](c ) ] ab - periodic features are found in @xmath14 indicating that either the coherent coupling between the two systems also influences @xmath14 or that there is a considerable ab - modulated net current flowing from the ring leads into the dot .    in a quantum dot the addition energy between two resonances is not only determined by space quantization effects but is enhanced by coulomb interactions between the electrons on the dot . \n this is not included in our calculation and could explain the slightly stronger modulation as a function of gate voltage in the experimental data when comparing with the model at @xmath156k in fig.[fig4](c)-(d ) . while we think that our model accurately describes the regime where the fano effect is strong , we find that in the experimental data at @xmath156k the dips in @xmath0 are closer to the actual peak positions of the dot than in the model . \n we have shown that the influence of cross - coupling from the dot is negligible in the completely decoupled system ( see also ref ) . \n however for @xmath119 - 69.9 mv the channel between the two structures is not pinched off and coulomb interactions could be stronger and possibly lead to modified fano line shapes close to the resonance condition of the dot.@xcite    we find that spin paired peaks involving subsequent filling of the same orbital do not only show similar behavior in @xmath14 but also lead to a similar interference pattern in @xmath0 as evident , e.g. , in fig.[fig4](b ) . \n we conclude , that spin is not important for the observed interference effect and kondo correlations@xcite are therefore negligible .    in conclusion \n , we have demonstrated that the current through a ring with a coherently side coupled dot leads to asymmetric line shapes in the current through the ring as a function of a gate voltage which tunes the discrete dot levels . \n this is indicative of the fano effect and we have shown that the symmetry of the observed fano line shapes can be tuned by applying a magnetic field . \n the @xmath10-parameter was adjusted with a gate voltage tuning the coupling between the ring and the dot . \n good agreement between the data and a single - channel scattering matrix model allows us to identify our structure with a fano scatterer embedded in a two - terminal ab - ring . \n comparison with this model also lets us to identify the additional leads on the dot as the dominant source of decoherence for the fano effect . raising the temperature to @xmath156k the fano effect almost completely disappears while ab - interference in the ring persists to above @xmath157k .",
        "abstract": "The study explores quantum ring-dot coupling, revealing Fano resonances in ring currents when the quantum dot's electron count changes. The symmetry of these resonances depends on magnetic flux and coupling strength. While Fano effects vanish above 0.65 K due to decoherence, Aharonov-Bohm interference in the ring persists up to 4.2 K. Experimental findings align with a scattering matrix model, highlighting the role of quantum coherence and environmental impacts in such mesoscopic systems."

        "article": "information - theoretic research on capacity and coding for write - limited memory originates in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , \n the authors consider a model of write - once memory ( wom ) . \n in particular , each memory cell can be in state either 0 or 1 . \n the state of a cell can go from 0 to 1 , but not from 1 back to 0 later . \n these write - once bits are called _ wits_. it is shown that , the efficiency of storing information in a wom can be improved if one allows multiple rewrites and designs the storage / rewrite scheme carefully . \n multilevel flash memory is a storage technology where the charge level of any cell can be easily increased , but is difficult to decrease . \n recent multilevel cell technology allows many charge levels to be stored in a cell . \n cells are organized into blocks that contain roughly @xmath2 cells . \n the only way to decrease the charge level of a cell is to erase the whole block ( i.e. , set the charge on all cells to zero ) and reprogram each cell . \n this takes time , consumes energy , and reduces the lifetime of the memory . \n therefore , it is important to design efficient rewriting schemes that maximize the number of rewrites between two erasures @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . \n the rewriting schemes increase some cell charge levels based on the current cell state and message to be stored . in this paper \n , we call a rewriting scheme a _ modulation code_.    two different objective functions for modulation codes are primarily considered in previous work : ( i ) maximizing the number of rewrites for the worst case @xcite and ( ii ) maximizing for the average case @xcite . as \n finucane et al . \n @xcite mentioned , the reason for considering average performance is the averaging effect caused by the large number of erasures during the lifetime of a flash memory device . \n our analysis shows that the worst - case objective and the average case objective are two extreme cases of our optimization objective . \n we also discuss under what conditions each optimality measure makes sense .    in previous work ( e.g. , @xcite ) , \n many modulation codes are shown to be asymptotically optimal as the number of cell - levels @xmath0 goes to infinity . \n but the condition that @xmath1 can not be satisfied in practical systems . therefore , we also analyze asymptotically optimal modulation codes when @xmath0 is only moderately large using the results from load - balancing theory @xcite . \n this suggests an enhanced algorithm that improves the performance of practical system significantly . \n theoretical analysis and simulation results show that this algorithm performs better than other asymptotically optimal algorithms when @xmath0 is moderately large . \n the structure of the paper is as follows . \n the system model and performance evaluation metrics are discussed in section [ sec : optimality - measure ] . \n an asymptotically optimal modulation code , which is universal over arbitrary i.i.d . \n input distributions , is proposed in section [ sub : another - rewriting - algorithm ] . \n the storage efficiency of this asymptotically optimal modulation code is analyzed in section [ sec : an - enhanced - algorithm ] . \n an enhanced modulation code is also presented in section [ sec : an - enhanced - algorithm ] . \n the storage efficiency of the enhanced algorithm is also analyzed in section [ sec : an - enhanced - algorithm ] . \n simulation results and comparisons are presented in section [ sec : simulation - results ] . \n the paper is concluded in section [ sec : conclusion ] . \n flash memory devices usually rely on error detecting / correcting codes to ensure a low error rate . so far \n , practical systems tend to use bose - chaudhuri - hocquenghem ( bch ) and reed - solomon ( rs ) codes . \n the error - correcting codes ( ecc s ) are used as the outer codes while the modulation codes are the inner codes . in this paper , we focus on the modulation codes and ignore the noise and the design of ecc for now . \n let us assume that a block contains @xmath3 @xmath0-level cells and that @xmath4 cells ( called an @xmath4-cell ) are used together to store @xmath5 @xmath6-ary variables ( called a @xmath5-variable ) . \n a block contains @xmath7 @xmath4-cells and the @xmath7 @xmath5-variables are assumed to be i.i.d . random variables . \n we assume that all the @xmath5-variables are updated together randomly at the same time and the new values are stored in the corresponding @xmath4-cells . \n this is a reasonable assumption in a system with an outer ecc . \n we use the subscript @xmath8 to denote the time index and each rewrite increases @xmath8 by 1 . \n when we discuss a modulation code , we focus on a single @xmath4-cell . \n ( the encoder of the modulation code increases some of the cell - levels based on the current cell - levels and the new value of the @xmath5-variable . ) \n remember that cell - levels can only be increased during a rewrite . \n so , when any cell - level must be increased beyond the maximum value @xmath9 , the whole block is erased and all the cell levels are reset to zero . \n we let the maximal allowable number of block - erasures be @xmath10 and assume that after @xmath10 block erasures , the device becomes unreliable . \n assume the @xmath5-variable written at time @xmath8 is a random variable @xmath11 sampled from the set @xmath12 with distribution @xmath13 . \n for convenience , we also represent the @xmath5-variable at time @xmath8 in the vector form as @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the set of integers modulo @xmath6 . \n the cell - state vector at time @xmath8 is denoted as @xmath16 and @xmath17 denotes the charge level of the @xmath18-th cell at time @xmath19 when we say @xmath20 we mean @xmath21 for @xmath22 since the charge level of a cell can only be increased , continuous use of the memory implies that an erasure of the whole block will be required at some point . \n although writes , reads and erasures can all introduce noise into the memory , we neglect this and assume that the writes , reads and erasures are noise - free . \n consider writing information to a flash memory when encoder knows the previous cell state @xmath23 the current @xmath5-variable @xmath24 , and an encoding function @xmath25 that maps @xmath24 and @xmath26 to a new cell - state vector @xmath27 . \n the decoder only knows the current cell state @xmath27 and the decoding function @xmath28 that maps the cell state @xmath27 back to the variable vector @xmath29 . \n of course , the encoding and decoding functions could change over time to improve performance , but we only consider time - invariant encoding / decoding functions for simplicity . \n the idea of designing efficient modulation codes jointly to store multiple variables in multiple cells was introduced by jiang @xcite . in previous work on modulation codes \n design for flash memory ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the lifetime of the memory ( either worst - case or average ) is maximized given fixed amount of information per rewrite . \n improving storage density and extending the lifetime of the device are two conflicting objectives . \n one can either fix one and optimize the other or optimize over these two jointly . \n most previous work ( e.g. , @xcite ) takes the first approach by fixing the amount of information for each rewrite and maximizing the number of rewrites between two erasures . in this paper \n , we consider the latter approach and our objective is to maximize the total amount of information stored in the device until the device dies . \n this is equivalent to maximizing the average ( over the @xmath5-variable distribution @xmath13 ) amount of information stored per cell -

cell changes to the same value , should it count as stored information ? should this count as a rewrite ? \n this formula assumes that it counts as a rewrite , so that @xmath34 values ( rather than @xmath35 ) can be stored during each rewrite . \n ] can be upper - bounded by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of rewrites between the @xmath38-th and the @xmath18-th erasures . \n note that the upper bound in ( [ eq : total_info_ub ] ) is achievable by uniform input distribution , i.e. , when the input @xmath5-variable is uniformly distributed over @xmath39 , each rewrite stores @xmath40 bits of information . \n due to the i.i.d . \n property of the input variables over time , @xmath37 s are i.i.d . \n random variables over time . since @xmath37 s are i.i.d . over time \n , we can drop the subscript @xmath18 . \n since @xmath10 , which is the maximum number of erasures allowed , is approximately on the order of @xmath41 , by the law of large numbers ( lln ) , we have @xmath42k\\log_{2}(l).\\ ] ] let the set of all valid encoder / decoder pairs be @xmath43 where @xmath44 implies the charge levels are element -

erasure is required when any cell within a block reaches its maximum allowed value . \n the time when a block erasure is required is defined as @xmath52 it is easy to see that @xmath53=ne\\left[t\\right],$ ] where the expectations are over the @xmath5-variable distribution . so maximizing @xmath54 $ ] is equivalent to maximizing @xmath55 . \n so the optimization problem ( [ eq : opt2 - 1 ] ) can be written as the following optimization problem @xmath56.\\label{eq : opt3}\\ ] ] under the assumption that the input is i.i.d . \n over all the @xmath4-cells and time indices , one finds that the @xmath50 s are i.i.d . random variables . \n let their common probability density function ( pdf ) be @xmath57 it is easy to see that @xmath58 is the minimum of @xmath7 i.i.d . \n random variables with pdf @xmath57 therefore , we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath61 \n so , the optimization problem ( [ eq : opt3 ] ) becomes @xmath62=\\max_{f , g\\in\\mathcal{q}}\\int nf_{t}(x)\\left(1-f_{t}(x)\\right)^{n-1}x\\mbox{d}x.\\label{eq : opt}\\ ] ] note that when @xmath63 the optimization problem in ( [ eq : opt ] ) simplifies to @xmath64.\\label{eq : opt2}\\ ] ] this is essentially the case that the authors in @xcite consider . \n when the whole block is used as one @xmath4-cell and the number of erasures allowed is large , optimizing the average ( over all input sequences ) number of rewrites of an @xmath4-cell is equivalent to maximizing the total amount of information stored @xmath65 the analysis also shows that the reason we consider average performance is not only due to the averaging effect caused by the large number of erasures . \n one other important assumption is that there is only one @xmath4-cell per block . \n the other extreme is when @xmath66 in this case , the pdf @xmath67 tends to a point mass at the minimum of @xmath8 and the integral @xmath68 approaches the minimum of @xmath8 . \n this gives the worst case stopping time for the programming process of an @xmath4-cell . \n this case is considered by @xcite . \n our analysis shows that we should consider the worst case when @xmath69 even though the device experiences a large number of erasures . \n so the optimality measure is not determined only by @xmath10 , but also by @xmath70 when @xmath7 and @xmath10 are large , it makes more sense to consider the worst case performance . when @xmath71 , it is better to consider the average performance . when @xmath7 is moderately large \n , we should maximize the number of rewrites using ( [ eq : opt ] ) which balances the worst case and the average case . \n when @xmath7 is moderately large , one should probably focus on optimizing the function in ( [ eq : opt ] ) , but it is not clear how to do this directly . \n so , this remains an open problem for future research . \n instead , we will consider a load - balancing approach to improve practical systems where @xmath0 is moderately large . \n if we assume that there is only one variable changed each time , the average amount of information per cell - level can be bounded by @xmath72 because there are @xmath73 possible new values . \n since the number of rewrites can be bounded by @xmath74 we have @xmath75 if we allow arbitrary change on the @xmath5-variables , there are totally @xmath76 possible new values . \n it can be shown that @xmath77 for fixed @xmath6 and @xmath0 , the bound in ( [ eq : storage_efficiency_bound ] ) suggests using a large @xmath5 can improve the storage efficiency . \n this is also the reason jointly coding over multiple cells can improve the storage efficiency @xcite . since optimal rewriting schemes only allow a single cell - level to increase by one during each rewrite , decodability implies that @xmath78 for the first case and @xmath79 for the second case . \n therefore , the bounds in ( [ eq : storage_efficiency_bound2 ] ) and ( [ eq : storage_efficiency_bound ] ) also require large @xmath4 to improve storage efficiency . \n the upper bound in ( [ eq : storage_efficiency_bound ] ) grows linearly with @xmath5 while the upper bound in ( [ eq : storage_efficiency_bound2 ] ) grows logarithmically with @xmath5 . \n therefore , in the remainder of this paper , we assume an arbitrary change in the @xmath5-variable per rewrite and @xmath71 , i.e. , the whole block is used as an @xmath4-cell , to improve the storage efficiency . \n this approach implicitly trades instantaneous capacity for future storage capacity because more cells are used to store the same number of bits , but the cells can also be reused many more times . \n note that the assumption of @xmath71 might be difficult for real implementation , but its analysis gives an upper bound on the storage efficiency . from the analysis above with @xmath71 \n , we also know that maximizing @xmath33 is equivalent to maximize the average number of rewrites . \n in @xcite , modulation codes are proposed that are asymptotically optimal ( as @xmath0 goes to infinity ) in the average sense when @xmath80 . in this section , \n we introduce a modulation code that is asymptotically optimal for arbitrary input distributions and arbitrary @xmath5 and @xmath6 . this rewriting algorithm can be seen as an extension of the one in @xcite . \n the goal is , to increase the cell - levels uniformly on average for an arbitrary input distribution . \n of course , decodability must be maintained . \n the solution is to use common information , known to both the encoder ( to encode the input value ) and the decoder ( to ensure the decodability ) , to randomize the cell index over time for each particular input value . \n let us assume the @xmath5-variable is an i.i.d . \n random variable over time with arbitrary distribution @xmath13 and the @xmath5-variable at time @xmath8 is denoted as @xmath81 the output of the decoder is denoted as @xmath82 we choose @xmath83 and let the cell state vector at time @xmath8 be @xmath84 , where @xmath17 is the charge level of the @xmath18-th cell at time @xmath19 at @xmath85 , the variables are initialized to @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .    the decoding algorithm @xmath89 is described as follows . \n * step 1 : read cell state vector @xmath27 and calculate the @xmath90 norm @xmath91 . \n * step 2 : calculate @xmath92 and @xmath93    the encoding algorithm @xmath94 is described as follows . \n * step 1 : read cell state @xmath26 and calculate @xmath95 and @xmath96 as above . if @xmath97 then do nothing . * \n step 2 : calculate @xmath98 and @xmath99 * step 3 : increase the charge level of the @xmath100-th cell by 1 .    for convenience , in the rest of the paper , we refer the above rewriting algorithm as `` self - randomized modulation code '' . \n the self - randomized modulation code achieves at least @xmath101 rewrites with high probability , as @xmath102 for arbitrary @xmath103 @xmath104 and i.i.d \n . input distribution @xmath13 . \n therefore , it is asymptotically optimal for random inputs as @xmath1 . \n [ sketch of proof ] the proof is similar to the proof in @xcite . \n since exactly one cell has its level increased by 1 during each rewrite , @xmath105 is an integer sequence that increases by 1 at each rewrite . \n the cell index to be written @xmath100 is randomized by adding the value @xmath106 . \n this causes each consecutive sequence of @xmath76 rewrites to have a uniform affect on all cell levels . as @xmath1 , \n an unbounded number of rewrites is possible and we can assume @xmath107 . \n consider the first @xmath108 steps , the value @xmath109 is as even as possible over @xmath110 for convenience , we say there are \n @xmath111 @xmath112 s at each value , as the rounding difference by 1 is absorbed in the @xmath113 term . \n assuming the input distribution is @xmath114 . \n for the case that @xmath115 , the probability that @xmath116 is @xmath117 for @xmath118 . \n therefore , @xmath119 has a uniform distribution over @xmath12 . \n since inputs are independent over time , by applying the same chernoff bound argument as @xcite , it follows that the number of times @xmath116 is at most @xmath120 with high probability ( larger than @xmath121 ) for all @xmath122 . summing over @xmath122 \n , we finish the proof . \n notice that the randomizing term @xmath105 a deterministic term which makes @xmath100 look _ random _ over time in the sense that there are equally many terms for each value . \n moreover , @xmath105 is known to both the encoder and the decoder such that the encoder can generate `` uniform '' cell indices over time and the decoder knows the accumulated value of @xmath105 , it can subtract it out and recover the data correctly . \n although this algorithm is asymptotically optimal as @xmath1 , the maximum number of rewrites @xmath123 can not be achieved for moderate @xmath0 . \n this motivates the analysis and the design of an enhanced version of this algorithm for practical systems in next section . \n a self - randomized modulation code uses @xmath83 cells to store a @xmath5-variable . \n this is much larger than the @xmath124 used by previous asymptotically optimal algorithms because we allow the @xmath5-variable to change arbitrarily . \n although this seems to be a waste of cells , the average amount of information stored per cell - level is actually maximized ( see ( [ eq : storage_efficiency_bound2 ] ) and ( [ eq : storage_efficiency_bound ] ) ) . \n in fact , the definition of asymptotic optimality requires @xmath79 if we allow arbitrary changes to the @xmath5-variable . \n we note that the optimality of the self - randomized modulation codes is similar to the weak robust codes presented in @xcite . \n we use @xmath83 cells to store one of @xmath125 possible messages . \n this is slightly worse than the simple method of using @xmath126 . \n is it possible to have self - randomization using only @xmath126 cells ? \n a preliminary analysis of this question based on group theory indicates that it is not . \n thus , the extra cell provides the possibility to randomize the mappings between message values and the cell indices over time . \n while asymptotically optimal modulation codes ( e.g. , codes in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the self - randomized modulation codes described in section [ sec : another - rewriting - algorithm ] ) require @xmath1 , practical systems use @xmath0 values between @xmath127 and @xmath128 . compared to the number of cells @xmath4 , \n the size of @xmath0 is not quite large enough for asymptotic optimality to suffice . in other words , codes that are asymptotically optimal \n may have significantly suboptimal performance when the system parameters are not large enough . \n moreover , different asymptotically optimal codes may perform differently when @xmath0 is not large enough . therefore , asymptotic optimality can be misleading in this case . in this section , \n we first analyze the storage efficiency of self - randomized modulation codes when @xmath0 is not large enough and then propose an enhanced algorithm which improves the storage efficiency significantly . \n before we analyze the storage efficiency of asymptotically optimal modulation codes for moderately large @xmath0 , we first show the connection between rewriting process and the load - balancing problem ( aka the balls - into - bins or balls - and - bins problem ) which is well studied in mathematics and computer science @xcite . \n basically , the load - balancing problem considers how to distribute objects among a set of locations as evenly as possible . \n specifically , the balls - and - bins model considers the following problem . \n if @xmath129 balls are thrown into @xmath4 bins , with each ball being placed into a bin chosen independently and uniformly at random , define the _ load _ as the number of balls in a bin , what is the maximal load over all the bins ? based on the results in theorem 1 in @xcite , we take a simpler and less accurate approach to the balls - into - bins problem and arrive at the following theorem .    [ thm : random_loading]suppose that @xmath129 balls are sequentially placed into @xmath4 bins . each time \n a bin is chosen independently and uniformly at random . \n the maximal load over all the bins is @xmath130 and :    ( @xmath18 ) if @xmath131 the maximally loaded bin has @xmath132 balls , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , with high probability ( @xmath135 ) as @xmath136    ( @xmath137 ) if @xmath138 , the maximally loaded bin has @xmath139 balls , @xmath140 , with high probability ( @xmath135 ) as @xmath136    ( @xmath141 ) if @xmath142 the maximally loaded bin has @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , with high probability ( @xmath135 ) as @xmath136    denote the event that there are at least @xmath5 balls in a particular bin as @xmath147 . using the union bound over all subsets of size \n @xmath103 it is easy to show that the probability that @xmath147 occurs is upper bounded by @xmath148 using stirling s formula , we have @xmath149 . then @xmath150 can be further bounded by @xmath151 if @xmath152 , substitute @xmath153 to the rhs of ( [ eq : maxload_ub ] ) , we have @xmath154 denote the event that all bins have at most @xmath5 balls as @xmath155 . by applying the union bound , it is shown that @xmath156 since @xmath157 we finish the proof for the case of @xmath158    if @xmath138 , substitute @xmath159 to the rhs of ( [ eq : maxload_ub ] ) , we have @xmath160 by applying the union bound , we finish the proof for the case of @xmath161    if @xmath142 substitute @xmath162 to the rhs of ( [ eq : maxload_ub ] ) , we have @xmath163 where @xmath164 by applying the union bound , it is shown that @xmath165 since @xmath166 we finish the proof for the case of @xmath167    note that theorem [ thm : random_loading ] only shows an upper bound on the maximum load @xmath130 with a simple proof . \n more precise results can be found in theorem 1 of @xcite , where the exact order of @xmath130 is given for different cases . \n it is worth mentioning that the results in theorem 1 of @xcite are different from theorem [ thm : random_loading ] because theorem 1 of @xcite holds with probability @xmath168 while theorem [ thm : random_loading ] holds with probability ( @xmath135 ) . \n the asymptotic optimality in the rewriting process implies that each rewrite only increases the cell - level of a cell by 1 and all the cell - levels are fully used when an erasure occurs . \n this actually implies @xmath169 . \n since @xmath4 is usually a large number and @xmath0 is not large enough in practice , the theorem shows that , when @xmath0 is not large enough , asymptotic optimality is not achievable . \n for example , in practical systems , the number of cell - levels @xmath0 does not depend on the number of cells in a block . \n therefore , rather than @xmath74 only roughly @xmath170 charge levels can be used as @xmath171 if @xmath0 is a small constant which is independent of @xmath4 . in practice \n , this loss could be mitigated by using writes that increase the charge level in multiple cells simultaneously ( instead of erasing the block ) . \n [ thm : gamma1]the self - randomized modulation code has storage efficiency @xmath172 when @xmath173 and @xmath174 when @xmath175 as @xmath4 goes to infinity with high probability ( i.e. , @xmath168 ) .    consider the problem of throwing @xmath129 balls into @xmath4 bins and let the r.v . \n @xmath10 be the number of balls thrown into @xmath4 bins until some bin has more than @xmath9 balls in it . while we would like to calculate @xmath176 $ ] exactly \n , we still settle for an approximation based on the following result . if @xmath177 , then there is a constant @xmath178 such that maximum number of balls @xmath130 in any bin satisfies@xmath179 with probability @xmath168 as @xmath171 @xcite . \n the constant @xmath178 is given by the largest @xmath180-root of@xmath181 and solving this equation for @xmath182 gives the implicit expression @xmath183 . \n since the lower bound matches the expected maximum value better , we define @xmath184 and apply it to our problem using the equation @xmath185 or @xmath186 . \n therefore , the storage efficiency is @xmath187    if @xmath188 , the maximum load is approximately @xmath189 with probability @xmath168 for large @xmath4 @xcite . by definition , \n therefore , the storage efficiency is @xmath191    the results in theorem [ thm : gamma1 ] show that when @xmath0 is on the order of @xmath192 , the storage efficiency is on the order of @xmath193 . taking the limit as @xmath194 with @xmath195 , we have @xmath196 when @xmath0 is a constant independent of @xmath4 , the storage efficiency is on the order of @xmath197 taking the limit as @xmath171 with @xmath173 , we have @xmath198 . in this regime , the self - randomized modulation codes actually perform very poorly even though they are asymptotically optimal as @xmath1 . \n considering the bins - and - balls problem , can we distribute balls more evenly when @xmath199 is on the order of @xmath200 fortunately , when @xmath201 , the maximal load can be reduced by a factor of roughly @xmath202 by using _ \n the power of two random choices _ @xcite . in detail , \n the strategy is , every time we pick two bins independently and uniformly at random and throw a ball into the less loaded bin . by doing this , \n the maximally loaded bin has roughly @xmath203 balls with high probability . \n theorem 1 in @xcite gives the answer in a general form when we consider @xmath204 random choices . \n the theorem shows there is a large gain when the number of random choice is increased from 1 to 2 . beyond that , the gain is on the same order and only the constant can be improved . \n based on the idea of 2 random choices , we define the following load - balanced modulation code .    again , we let the cell state vector at time @xmath8 be @xmath84 , where @xmath17 is the charge level of the @xmath18-th cell at time @xmath19 this time , we use @xmath205 cells to store a @xmath5-variable @xmath206 ( i.e. , we write @xmath207 bits to store @xmath208 bits of information ) . \n the information loss provides @xmath6 ways to write the same value . \n this flexibility allows us to avoid sequences of writes that increase one cell level too much . \n we are primarily interested in binary variables with 2 random choices or @xmath209 . for the power of @xmath6 choices to be effective , we must try to randomize ( over time ) , the @xmath6 possible choices over the set of all @xmath210 possibilities . the value @xmath91 is used to do this . \n let @xmath211 be the galois field with @xmath212 elements and @xmath213 be a bijection that satisfies @xmath214 ( i.e. , the galois field element 0 is associated with the integer 0 ) . \n the decoding algorithm calculates @xmath215 from @xmath27 and operates as follows :    * step 1 : read cell state vector @xmath27 and calculate the @xmath90 norm @xmath91 . \n * step 2 : calculate @xmath216 and @xmath217 * step 3 : calculate @xmath218 and @xmath219 * step 4 : calculate @xmath220 . \n the encoding algorithm stores @xmath11 and operates as follows . \n * step 1 : read cell state @xmath26 and decode to @xmath221 and @xmath96 . if @xmath222 then do nothing . \n * step 2 : calculate @xmath223 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 * step 3 : calculate @xmath224 and @xmath225 for @xmath226 . \n * step 4 : calculate @xmath227 . \n increase the charge level by 1 of cell @xmath228 . \n note that the state vector at @xmath85 is initialized to @xmath229 and therefore @xmath87 . \n the first arbitrary value that can be stored is @xmath230 . \n the following conjecture suggests that the ball - loading performance of the above algorithm is identical to the random loading algorithm with @xmath209 random choices . \n [ thm : gamma2]if @xmath209 and @xmath175 , then the load - balancing modulation code has storage efficiency @xmath231 with probability 1-@xmath232 as @xmath171 . if @xmath233 the storage efficiency @xmath234 with probability 1-@xmath232 .    [ sketch of proof ] \n consider the affine permutation @xmath235 for @xmath236 and @xmath237 . \n as @xmath238 vary , this permutation maps the two elements @xmath11 and @xmath239 uniformly over all pairs of cell indices . \n after @xmath240 steps , we see that all pairs of @xmath238 occur equally often . \n therefore , by picking the less charged cell , the modulation code is almost identical to the random loading algorithm with two random choices . \n unfortunately , we are interested in the case where @xmath241 so the analysis is somewhat more delicate . if @xmath177 , the highest charge level is @xmath242 with probability @xmath168 @xcite . since @xmath175 in this case , the storage efficiency is @xmath243 . \n if @xmath188 , then @xmath173 and the maximum load is @xmath244 . by definition , \n we have @xmath245 therefore , we have @xmath246    if @xmath209 and @xmath0 is on the order of @xmath247 conjecture [ thm : gamma2 ] shows that the bound ( [ eq : storage_efficiency_bound ] ) is achievable by load - balancing modulation codes as @xmath4 goes to infinity . in this regime , \n the load - balancing modulation codes provide a better constant than self - randomized modulation codes by using twice many cells . \n [ rem : if \n @xmath209 and @xmath0 is a constant independent of @xmath4 , the storage efficiency is @xmath248 for the self - randomized modulation code and @xmath249 for the load - balancing modulation code . \n but , the self - randomized modulation code uses @xmath250 cells and the load - balancing modulation code uses @xmath251 cells . to make fair comparison on the storage efficiency between them , we let @xmath251 for both codes . \n then we have @xmath252 and @xmath249 . \n so , as @xmath171 , we see that @xmath253 . \n therefore , the load - balancing modulation code outperforms the self - randomized code when @xmath4 is sufficiently large . \n in this section , we present the simulation results for the modulation codes described in sections [ sub : another - rewriting - algorithm ] and [ sub : an - enhanced - algorithm ] . in the figures , \n the first modulation code is called the `` self - randomized modulation code '' while the second is called the `` load - balancing modulation code '' . \n let the `` loss factor '' @xmath254 be the fraction of cell - levels which are not used when a block erasure is required : @xmath255}{n(q-1)}.$ ] we show the loss factor for random loading with 1 and 2 random choices as comparison . \n note that @xmath254 does not take the amount of information per cell - level into account . \n results in fig . \n [ flo : fig2 ] show that the self - randomized modulation code has the same @xmath254 with random loading with 1 random choice and the load - balancing modulation code has the same @xmath254 with random loading with 2 random choices . \n this shows the optimality of these two modulation codes in terms of ball loading .    , @xmath209 and 1000 erasures.[flo : fig2 ] ]     with @xmath80 , @xmath256 @xmath257 and 1000 erasures.[flo : fig4 ] ]    .[fig : fig5 ] ]    .[fig : fig6 ] ] \n we also provide the simulation results for random loading with 1 random choice and the codes designed in @xcite , which we denote as flm-(@xmath258 ) algorithm , in fig . \n [ flo : fig4 ] . from results shown in fig . \n [ flo : fig4 ] , we see that the flm-(@xmath258 ) algorithm has the same loss factor as random loading with 1 random choice . \n this can be actually seen from the proof of asymptotic optimality in @xcite as the algorithm transforms an arbitrary input distribution into an uniform distribution on the cell - level increment . \n note that flm algorithm is only proved to be optimal when 1 bit of information is stored . \n so we just compare the flm algorithm with random loading algorithm in this case . \n [ fig : fig5 ] and fig . \n [ fig : fig6 ] show the storage efficiency @xmath33 for these two modulation codes . \n [ fig : fig5 ] and fig . \n [ fig : fig6 ] show that the load - balancing modulation code performs better than self - randomized modulation code when @xmath4 is large . \n this is also shown by the theoretical analysis in remark [ rem : if  is ] . \n in this paper , we consider modulation code design problem for practical flash memory storage systems . the storage efficiency , or average ( over the distribution of input variables ) amount of information per cell - level is maximized . under this framework \n , we show the maximization of the number of rewrites for the the worst - case criterion @xcite and the average - case criterion @xcite are two extreme cases of our optimization objective . \n the self - randomized modulation code is proposed which is asymptotically optimal for arbitrary input distribution and arbitrary @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as the number of cell - levels @xmath1 . \n we further consider performance of practical systems where @xmath0 is not large enough for asymptotic results to dominate . \n then we analyze the storage efficiency of the self - randomized modulation code when @xmath0 is only moderately large . \n then the load - balancing modulation codes are proposed based on the power of two random choices @xcite @xcite . \n analysis and numerical simulations show that the load - balancing scheme outperforms previously proposed algorithms .",

a @xcite , lies at the extreme northern end of the main shock wave . \n ngc 7318a ( west of ngc 7318b ) is also a strongly interacting group member , with ngc 7317 further away from the core . \n the unexpected discovery of extremely powerful , pure - rotational h@xmath9 line emission from the center of the shock @xcite , using the _ spitzer space telescope _ \n @xcite , has sparked intense interest in the sq system . \n warm molecular hydrogen emission was found with a line luminosity exceeding the x - ray luminosity from the shock . \n the mid - infrared ( mir ) h@xmath9 linewidth was resolved ( @xmath14 870 km s@xmath13 ) suggesting that the h@xmath9-emitting clouds carry a large bulk - kinetic energy , tapping a large percentage of the energy available in the shock . \n a recent model of sq , involving the collision between two inhomogeneous gas flows , describes h@xmath9 formation out of the multiphase , shocked gas , and an efficient cooling channel for high - speed shocks as an alternative to x - ray emission @xcite    since the sq detection , several other systems exhibiting similarly strong h@xmath9 emission have been discovered . \n @xcite find that a large - subset of the local 3cr radio galaxies have extremely dominant mir rotational h@xmath9 lines , often seen against a very weak thermal continuum . \n the low agn and star formation power are insufficient to drive the mir h@xmath5  emission . mechanical heating driven by the radio jet interaction with the host galaxy ism is the favoured mechanism . \n in addition , total h@xmath9 luminosities in the range @xmath15 ergs s@xmath13 have been detected in some central cluster galaxies out to @xmath16 ( * ? ? ? \n * g. de messieres - university of virginia , private communication ) and in filaments in clusters @xcite . \n the study of nearby prototypes may provide valuable insight into the nature of these more distant systems . the large scale ( @xmath6  30  kpc ) of the sq shock is well - suited for such a study .    in this paper \n i , we extend the single pointing observations of @xcite to full spectral maps of sq using the irs instrument on the _ spitzer _ space telescope , hereafter _ spitzer_. in paper ii \n , we will present detailed 2-dimensional excitation maps of the h@xmath5 emission across the face of the x - ray emitting shock , and compare them with models . \n in addition , several other papers are being prepared by our team which will discuss the relationship between the uv / x - ray emission and emission from dust .    in section 2 \n , we present our observations and data reduction methods . in section 3 \n we discuss the mapping results for various detected lines . in sections 4 , 5 and 6 \n we present our discussion on the properties of the system and in section 7 the implication for galaxy formation . in section 8 \n we present our conclusions . \n additional material is included as appendices , with a discussion on ngc 7319 in appendix a , and a reanalysis of the high resolution mir spectrum of the shock , as well as renanalysis of the x - ray data presented in appendix b and c , respectively .    throughout this paper , we assume a systemic velocity of @xmath17 for the group , corresponding to a distance of 94 mpc with @xmath18 . \n mid - infrared spectroscopy of the shock region in sq was obtained using the irs instrument @xcite onboard _ \n spitzer_. observations were done in low - resolution mapping mode , using the short - low ( @xmath19 ; @xmath20 ) and long - low ( @xmath21 ; @xmath22 ) modules and taken on january 11 2008 and december 10 2007 , respectively . \n figure 1 displays the outline of the areas observed superimposed on a composite image of the group . \n the sl spectral mapping consists of two separate , partially overlapping maps , centered north and south on the x - ray emission associated with the shock . \n the map was constructed with 23 steps of 2.8(0.75 @xmath2 slit width ) perpendicular to the slit and one parallel step of 7.2 . \n observations consisted of 60s integrations with 5 cycles per step . \n the ll module was used to map an area of @xmath23 using 21 steps of 8.0  ( 0.75 @xmath2 slit width ) perpendicular to the slit and a parallel step of 24.0 . \n an integration time of 120s was used with 3 cycles per step . \n primary data reductions were done by the _ spitzer _ \n science center ( ssc ) pipeline , version s17.0.4 and s17.2.0 for sl and ll respectively , which performs standard reductions such as ramp fitting , dark current subtraction and flat - fielding . \n background subtraction for ll data was performed by subtracting dedicated off - source observations , with the same observing mode , taken shortly after the mapping sequence . in the case of sl , where for scheduling reasons the dedicated `` off '' observations were too far away in time to be optimal , backgrounds were generated from observations at the periphery of the map that contain no spectral line signatures . \n examination of the pipeline products showed that the stray - light - corrected images ( that account for potential spillover from the peak - up arrays onto the sl1/2 spectral apertures ) contained wavelength - dependent over - corrections in some of the images , seemingly due to a high background of cosmic rays during the sl portion of the mapping . to negate this effect , the alternative flat - fielded images ( also available from the science pipeline ) that are uncorrected for crosstalk and straylight removal were used . \n it was determined that after background subtraction , any uncorrected stray light in the sl spectral extraction areas was unmeasurable at the @xmath24% level . \n thus stray - light correction was unneccesary , and the resulting basic calibrated data ( bcd ) images used were of better quality than the standard bcds .    for all modules , individual frames for each pointing \n were median - combined and obvious `` bad '' pixels were replaced using customised software that allows for manual `` average '' replacement . \n the spectra were assembled into spectral cubes for each module using the software tool , cubism @xcite . \n further bad pixel removal was performed within cubism . \n spectral maps were generated by making continuum maps on either side of a feature and subtracting the averaged continuum map from the relevant emission line map . \n one dimensional spectra were further extracted from the data cubes using matched apertures . \n broad - band images at 16 and 24@xmath25 m were obtained with the _ spitzer _ irs blue peak - up imager ( pui ) and the mips instrument . \n the pui was obtained in a 5 x 5 map with 3 cycles of 30s duration each on 2007 december 10 . \n the mips instrument @xcite on _ spitzer _ obtained 24  imaging of sq on 2008 july 29 , achieving a spatial resolution of @xmath66 . \n primary data reduction was done by the _ spitzer _ \n science center ( ssc ) science pipeline ( version s18.0.2 ) run through the mopex software , and for the mips image a smooth 2d polynomial background was further removed to correct for a large - scale background gradient . _ \n spitzer _ irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0  data of sq ( p.i . \n houck ) were obtained from the ssc archive ; these were reduced using science pipeline version s18.0.2 . \n the final mosaics have a pixel scale of 0.61 . \n the pure rotational transitions of molecular hydrogen can be excited by several mechanisms . \n these include fuv ( far ultraviolet ) induced pumping , and possible additional collisional heating , of the h@xmath5  in photodissociation regions associated with star formation ( e. g. black & van dishoeck 1987 , hollenbach & tielens 1997 ) , hard x - rays penetrating and heating regions within molecular clouds , which in turn excite h@xmath5  via collisions with electrons or hydrogen atoms ( lepp & mccray 1983 ; draine & woods 1992 ) and finally collisional excitation of h@xmath5  due to acceleration produced by shocks ( e.g. shull & hollenbach 1978 ) . \n the pure rotational mir line ratios are not especially good diagnostics for distinguishing between these mechanisms since all three mechanisms discussed can lead to well thermalized level distributions of lower - level rotational states . \n the rotational h@xmath5  emission lines do , however , allow us to trace gas at different temperatures and compare with model predictions ( this will be the main emphasis of paper ii ) . \n higher level transitions 0 - 0 s(3)-s(5 ) tend to trace warmer gas , whereas the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines are sensitive to the `` coolest '' warm h@xmath5 . \n although the line ratios themselves can not be used directly as shock diagnostics , in stephan s quintet the distribution of large - scale x - ray and radio emission , plus optical emission line diagnostics , provide strong evidence that the giant filament seen in figure 1 is the result of a strong shock . in appleton et al . \n ( 2006 ) this fact was used to reveal the surprising association of detected h@xmath5  emission with the shock . however , in this paper we can make a more definitive association of the emission with the shock by means of spectral maps . \n the spectral cubes were used to extract maps of all the pure rotational emission lines of molecular hydrogen that were detected , namely the 0 - 0 s(0)28.22 , s(1)17.03 , s(2)12.28 , s(3)9.66 , s(4)8.03  and s(5)6.91  lines . \n specific intensity contour maps of these lines are presented in figure 2 overlaid on a @xmath26-band image of the region from @xcite . \n the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines were mapped by the ll modules , while s(2 ) - s(5 ) transitions were mapped by the sl modules of the irs . as indicated in figure 1 , \n the sl observations were concentrated on the main shock to provide high signal to noise ( s / n ) measurements there . as a result \n , these maps do not fully cover sq - a or ngc 7319 . \n we note that the s(4 ) line at 8.03  ( fig . \n 2e ) is faint , and also suffers from contamination from the pah bands at 7.7  and 8.6 . \n the contours indicate powerful , widespread emission running north - south along the shock ridge ( see fig . \n 1 ) . in addition \n we detect strong emission from the star forming region , sq - a , as well as associated with ngc 7319 . \n we discuss further details of the agn - like mir emission lines from ngc  7319 in appendix a.    figures 2a - d reveal a new h@xmath5  structure running eastward from the `` main '' shock ridge . in what follows \n , we refer to this feature as the `` bridge '' . \n this structure is observed faintly in the _ chandra _ @xcite and xmm @xcite x - ray images and detected as faint h@xmath27 emission by @xcite , but is not strong in radio continuum images . \n as is evident in figure 2 , there is distinct variation in the distribution of the warm h@xmath5  emission . the brightest 0 - 0  s(0 ) emission ( fig . \n 2a ) appears to be concentrated towards the north of the shock , whereas the 0 - 0  s(1 ) transition emission ( fig . \n 2b ) appears more concentrated towards the center . \n the s(0 ) and s(1 ) maps demonstrate that the h@xmath5  in the bridge terminates in a large clump a few arcsecs west of the nucleus of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  7319 , and in a small detour to the north ( especially in the s(1 ) map which has the highest s / n ) . \n the s(2 ) through s(5 ) lines clearly show that the warm h@xmath5  emission breaks into clumps in the shock . despite the limited coverage compared to the ll mapping , \n the base of the `` bridge '' is visible and sq - a is partially covered . \n sq - a is fully covered by the sl2 module ( because of fortuitous `` off observation '' coverage ) and hence the s(5 ) emission line reveals that in sq - a the h@xmath5  emission is also clumpy . \n the molecular - line maps provide considerable information about the excitation of the h@xmath5  along and across the x - ray shock , but these discussions will be deferred to a full 2-d modelling of the h@xmath5  excitation in paper ii ( appleton et al . , in preparation ) . \n instead we shall limit ourselves to global properties of the h@xmath5  here . in section [ spec ] \n we shall present spectra of some selected regions of the emission and discuss a global excitation diagram for the shock .        to further demonstrate the close connection between the h@xmath5  emission and the main global shock - wave in sq \n , we now consider the distribution of warm h@xmath5  in relation to the x - ray and radio emission . \n figure [ fig : xray_rad]a and b show the s(0 ) and s(3 ) contours overlaid on an xmm - newton x - ray image @xcite of stephan s quintet . \n the warm molecular hydrogen is distributed along the length of the main north - south ( ns ) x - ray shock ridge and along the `` bridge '' , demonstrating the remarkable projected coexistence of of hot x - ray plasma ( 10@xmath28 @xmath29 t @xmath29 10@xmath30 k ) and warm h@xmath5 ( 10@xmath31 @xmath29 t@xmath29 10@xmath32 k ) . \n although the h@xmath5  appears to follow the x - ray , there are subtle differences . \n the cooler s(0 ) line has emission concentrated to the north and follows the x - ray less closely compared to the warmer s(3 ) line . \n the s(3 ) line exhibits a clear correspondence to the x - ray , notably at the center of the shock , where we find peaks at both wavelengths . \n thus the region of greatest shock heating , as traced by the stronger x - ray emission , appears to correspond to the higher - j h@xmath5  transitions , perhaps implying a causal connection . \n the intergalactic star formation region sq - a , is essentially absent in x - ray emission , as seen in figure [ fig : xray_rad]a , but is strongly detected in h@xmath9 . \n we find a similar picture in the radio continuum ( fig . \n [ fig : xray_rad]c & d ) with the s(0 ) line demonstrating correspondence with the main shock , but dominated by emission in the north where we observe less powerful radio emission . \n the s(3 ) ( and s(2)see fig . \n 2c ) line presents a much tighter correlation with regions of the shock that are more radio luminous than the lower - j transitions . \n the radio emission is quite likely sensitive to the most compressed regions of the shock where cosmic ray particles are accelerated more strongly @xcite , whereas the brightest x - ray patches are likely due to the fastest regions of the shock @xcite . \n as already mentioned the `` bridge '' emission is detected only faintly in the x - ray and is weak or absent at radio continuum wavelengths . \n this noticeable difference compared to the main shock likely implies that the conditions that give rise to strong synchrotron emission in the main shock are absent in the bridge . \n emission from fine - structure lines provide key diagnostics that trace the interplay between the various constituents of the shocked interstellar medium . in @xcite \n the spectra were limited to the very core of the shock and only weak emission was detected from all but two metal lines , namely @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81and @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82  ( this data has been reanalysed and is presented in appendix b ) . in this section \n we discuss the spatial distribution of emission from the @xmath10feii@xmath11$]25.99 , @xmath10oiv@xmath11$]25.89 , @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48 , @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82 , @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81  and @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56  lines .    in figure \n [ fig : fs ] we present the specific intensity contours of the @xmath10feii@xmath11$]25.99  and @xmath10oiv@xmath11$]25.89  blend , @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  and @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82  emission lines .    given the low spectral resolution of the sl and ll modules of _ \n spitzer _ , we can not distinguish between emission from @xmath10fe ii@xmath11$]25.99  and @xmath10oiv@xmath11$]25.89 . \n however , except in the direction of the seyfert ii galaxy ngc  7319 , the emission near 26  seen in figure [ fig : fs]a is likely to be pure @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] with little contamination from @xmath10oiv@xmath11 $ ] as there is no evidence from the spectra of high - excitation emission from the intragroup medium in sq . \n for example , @xmath10oiv@xmath11 $ ] has an excitation potential of 56 ev ( compared to 7.9 ev of @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] ) , and yet @xcite have shown that the @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]/@xmath10neii@xmath11 $ ] ratio is low suggesting low - excitation conditions for the ions in the shock , further supported in section [ em ] . assuming that , apart from towards ngc  7319 , @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] dominates the @xmath10feii@xmath11$]+@xmath10oiv@xmath11 $ ] complex , we detect faint emission from @xmath10feii@xmath11$]25.99  at the location of the center of the shock ( as defined by the x - ray `` hotspot '' in fig . \n [ fig : xray_rad]a ) . the energetic requirements for shocks to produce strong @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] emission are usually present in @xmath33 shocks while the ion abundance in @xmath34 shocks are low in comparison @xcite . \n we will discuss the production of @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] in the shock in section 6.2 . \n the @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  distribution is presented in figure [ fig : fs]b . \n this fine structure line acts as a strong tracer of hii  regions @xcite and we observe emission from sq - a and from other regions of star formation in the south ( see section [ sf ] ) . in the primary shock region the distributions of @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] and @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] are anti - correlated .    in strong contrast to the weak @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] emission , there is copious @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82  emission ( fig . \n [ fig : fs]c ) , which follows the s(1 ) distribution closely with respect to the primary shock , as mapped by x - ray emission ( fig . \n [ fig : fs]d ) . \n although @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] is commonly found in normal hii  regions , we will demonstrate below that , apart from in sq - a , the strong silicon emission does not correlate with regions of strong pah emission ( tracing star formation ) in sq , but instead closely follows the h@xmath5  and x - ray ( shock ) distributions . @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] acts as an efficient coolant of x - ray - irradiated gas and is predicted to be one of the top four cooling lines under these circumstances @xcite . \n we will discuss the excitation of @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] in the shock in section 6.2 . \n @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81  ( with an ionisation potential of 21.6 ev ) is also represented in the shock , as shown in figure [ fig : ne]a , although it is also emitted from some hii  regions associated with star formation , such as sq - a and the star - forming region south of ngc 7318b ( see section [ sf ] ) . \n the @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56  contours ( with an ionisation potential of 41 ev ) are shown in figure [ fig : ne]b and are associated with excitation in the shock , as well as from regions of star formation ( see section [ sf ] ) \n . the higher ionisation line of @xmath10neiii@xmath11 $ ] is much weaker in the shock ridge , but regions of emission correspond closely to peaks seen for the h@xmath5  s(3 ) line . the @xmath10neii@xmath11 $ ] emission , however , exhibits clearly extended emission with regions of greatest luminosity matching those seen for the h@xmath5  s(3 ) line . \n the @xmath10neii@xmath11 $ ] emission suggests excitation from the shock , with @xmath10neiii@xmath11 $ ] found at the location of the center of the shock , similar to what is observed for @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] . \n previous observations and spectroscopy of sq @xcite have determined that there are some regions of star formation associated with the spiral arms of the intruder galaxy ngc  7318b . \n we discuss in this section how these regions , which have a different spatial distribution from the shocked gas , are correlated with the pah emission we detect in the irs spectra .    in figure \n [ fig : dust]a there is a strong correlation between the 11.3  pah distribution ( from the irs cube ) superimposed on a near - uv image from _ galex _ @xcite , which maps the uv emission from hot stars associated with weak star formation from the system . \n this correlation suggests that the pah molecules are excited by star formation . \n a similar close correlation is shown in figure [ fig : dust]b where we overlay the 11.3  contours on the irac 8  band , which is dominated by the 7.7 and 8.6 @xmath25 m feature . \n it is noticeable , however , that regions with strong 11.3  emission in the shock , do not appear similarly strong at 8 . \n this point will be addressed in section 6.4 . \n we compare the 11.3  pah map to the distribution of warm dust in figure [ fig : dust]c , using the mips 24@xmath25 m map of sq . \n again , it is clear that there is a good correlation between the pah emission and the thermal dust , most of which seems only poorly correlated with the shock ridge . \n the lack of conspicuous star formation in the ridge was also observed by @xcite . \n the main point we emphasize here is that the dust , pah and uv emission appears to be associated with previously known star formation regions and no additional star formation is observed in the shock ; this can be seen in figure [ fig : dust]d showing the h@xmath5 0 - 0 s(1 ) emission overlaid on an irac 8  image . \n there is little correspondence between the h@xmath5  emission in the shock and 8@xmath25 m ( hot dust plus pah ) image . \n this is important because it implies that there is very little triggered star formation in the molecular gas associated with the shock - excited h@xmath5 . \n figure [ fig : dust]c demonstrates that there is only faint dust emission at 24@xmath25 m from the shock ridge . \n the presence of dust in the shock is required in the model of guillard et al . \n ( 2009 ) to explain the formation of h@xmath5  behind the shock and we do observe evidence of depletion onto dust grains ( see section 6.2 ) . thus the faint 24  emission could be the result of destruction of very small grains ( vsgs ) , with only larger grains surviving , or indicate that the grains are cold and radiating more strongly at longer wavelengths , where _ spitzer _ has the least spatial resolution . \n a more detailed description of the dust and faint pah emission in the sq group ( including results from mips 70  imaging ) is discussed in separate papers ( guillard et al . 2010 . ; natale et al . \n 2009 , in preparation ) . \n guillard et al . \n ( 2010 ) show that the ir emission in the shock is faint due to dust being heated by a relatively low intensity uv radiation field and determine a galactic pah / vsg abundance ratio in this region . \n a more complete understanding of the likely existence of cool dust in the shock will require higher angular resolution and a broader wavelength coverage than that achieved by _ \n spitzer_.    despite the faintness of emission from the main shock , the 24@xmath25 m map presents a new result , which was less obvious in previous studies , namely that the dominant regions of star formation in sq lie not in the galaxies themselves , but in two strikingly powerful , almost symmetrically disposed regions at either end of the shock . \n the region to the north is the well studied sq - a , but the region to the south ( which we refer to as 7318b - south ) is also very powerful and both regions lie at the ends of the shock , as defined by the h@xmath5  distribution . \n this may not be a coincidence , and we will discuss this further in section 6.1 . \n the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81 , @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56  and @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  fine - structure lines , as mentioned above , are also tracers of star formation in sq as these lines are often associated with hii  regions . \n the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81  emission appears to follow _ both _ the h@xmath5  and the star formation regions ( see fig . [ \n fig : ne]a ) , appearing more extended in the south than the corresponding h@xmath5  emission and flaring out where star formation regions , especially 7318b - south , are observed optically , and through pah emission ( see fig . \n [ fig : dust ] ) . \n the warm molecular hydrogen in stephan s quintet follows the x - ray distribution in the main shock and in the `` bridge '' structure . \n this might suggest that the molecular hydrogen is excited directly by the x - ray heating . \n however , we will show that the h@xmath5  emission exceeds by at least a factor of 3 the x - ray luminosity from the various shocked filaments , thus ruling out direct x - ray excitation from the shock .    to measure the strength of the h@xmath5  emission , \n we extract spectra from various rectangular sub - areas of sq which are defined in figure [ fig : ext ] . \n the spectra were extracted from cubism cubes built from each irs module , and joined to make a continous spectrum \n no scaling was necessary to join the spectra . \n figures [ fig : ext ]  a ,  b and c indicate the spectral extraction regions of the main ns shock , a sub - region of the shock and a characteristic part of the `` bridge '' . the shock sub - region is chosen to be just north of the center of the shock , avoiding regions contaminated by star formation in the intruder . \n spectra for these extractions are shown in figure [ fig : spectra ]  a , b and c. all three spectra , share the common property that they are dominated by molecular hydrogen emission . \n the shock sub - region ( fig . \n [ fig : spectra]b ) , unlike figure [ fig : spectra]a , is less contaminated by the star forming regions discussed in the previous section . the mir continuum of the main shock appears stronger than the shock sub - region indicating stronger emission from warm dust ; this is likely the result of contamination from star - forming regions in the main shock extraction . \n the bridge exhibits a similarly weak continuum emission compared to the shock sub - region . \n figure [ fig : spectra]b includes photometry from the irac bands , 16  peak - up image ( pui ) and mips-24  image superimposed on the irs spectrum . \n these are useful to probe conditions in the shock , in particular star formation ( see section 6.4 ) . \n stellar light in the extraction area , from an extended spiral arm of ngc 7318b , produces contamination of the shock spectrum , visible as continuum emission shortwards of 6 , in both figure 8a and b.    there exists a striking similarity between the mid - ir spectrum of all three regions , showing powerful h@xmath5  lines and low excitation weak emission from fine structure lines . also the pah emission observed in the spectra of the shock regions , and in the region of the `` bridge '' in the irac 8  image ( fig . \n [ fig : dust]b ) , appears weak . \n this confirms that these properties , observed in the @xcite observations of the shock core , extend to both the full extent of the main shock and the `` bridge '' . \n this , and the fact that the `` bridge '' has similar x - ray properties to the main shock ( see later ) suggests that the bridge is a `` scaled - down '' version of the main shock . \n the weaker radio continuum emission at this location is significant . \n one possibility , that the `` bridge '' is older than the main shock , and the cosmic rays compressed in it have diffused away , will be discussed further in paper ii.thus the new irs observations seem to suggest that more than one large - scale group - wide shock is present in the group . \n this could be the result of previous tidal interactions and imply multiple shock heating events have taken place in sq , consistent with what is seen in the x - ray @xcite . \n figures [ fig : ext]d and [ fig : spectra]d present the extraction region and spectrum of sq - a , the extragalactic star - forming region . in this case , although h@xmath5  lines are still strong , a rising continuum and an increase in the strength of the metal lines relative to the h@xmath5  is consistent with a spectrum that is increasingly dominated by star formation  a result which is already known from previous optical observations @xcite . \n line fluxes for all the h@xmath5  and metal lines in the spectra discussed above are presented in table  [ tableh2fluxes ] and table  [ tablemetalfluxes ] , respectively . \n we estimate the luminosity emitted from the h@xmath5  lines in the main aperture shown in figure [ fig : spectra]a . \n the emission from the 0 - 0 s(1 ) line alone can be calculated from table  [ tableh2fluxes ] ( for d = 94  mpc ) to be 2.3  @xmath210@xmath35 ergs@xmath13 . \n summing the emission measured in the observed lines for the main shock ( 0 - 0 s(0 ) through s(5 ) lines ) and including an extra 28% emission from unobserved lines ( see model fit to excitation diagram below ) , yields a total h@xmath5  line luminosity from the main shock of 9.7  @xmath210@xmath35 ergs@xmath13 . \n this phenomenal power in the molecular hydrogen lines dwarfs by a factor of ten the next brightest mid - ir line , which is @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82  with a line luminosity of l@xmath36 = 0.85 @xmath210@xmath35 ergs@xmath13 . \n figure [ fig : excite ] presents the excitation diagram of the low - j 0 - 0 h@xmath5  transitions for the main shock extraction . \n the points are well fit by a model including three temperature components ( t@xmath37 = 158@xmath38k , t@xmath9 = 412@xmath39k , and t@xmath40 = 1500@xmath41k ) . \n it is likely that in reality , many different temperature components are present in the shock , and the three - temperature fit is only an approximation . \n however , it does allow us to provide an estimate of the total mass of warm h@xmath5  of 5.0@xmath4210@xmath43m@xmath44 . \n temperature t@xmath9 is more uncertain than formally represented by the fit because it depends on the value of the s(4 ) flux , which may be systematically too low due to pah contamination ( see fig . \n [ fig : excite ] ) . in paper \n ii we will present a more complete two - dimensional map of the excitation of the h@xmath5  in sq and explore variations in the shape of the excitation diagram along and across the shock in more detail . \n our observations have shown that h@xmath5  is the dominant line coolant in the mir . \n however , how does it compare with the most important coolant in high - speed shocks  namely the x - ray emission ? \n @xcite suggested that the h@xmath5  emission was stronger than the x - ray emission at the shock center . \n this can now be evaluated over much of the inner sq group . \n we present a complete reanalysis of the xmm - newton observations of sq using the latest calibrations ( see appendix c for full details ) in order to determine the fluxes and luminosities of the x - ray emission to match our spectral extractions . \n the results indicate the striking dominance of the h@xmath5  line luminosities compared with the x - ray emission from the same regions . for the main shock , the x - ray `` bolometric '' flux of l@xmath45 = 2.8  @xmath2  10@xmath46erg  s@xmath13@xmath47 corresponds to 2.95 @xmath2  10@xmath35  erg  s@xmath13 , or l(h@xmath5)/l@xmath45 = 2.9 . \n this is a lower limit since we have not attempted to remove the contribution to the main shock aperture of an extended group - wide x - ray component upon which the emission from the shock lies . therefore it is likely that the h@xmath5  line luminosity dominates over the main shock x - ray gas by a factor @xmath48 3 . \n similar calculations can be done for the other regions for which h@xmath5  spectra have been extracted . \n for example , in the `` bridge '' region , which we have already indicated has many of the same characteristics as the main shock , we find l(h@xmath5)/l@xmath45  =  2.5 . \n these values demonstrate that throughout the extended regions of sq , the molecular hydrogen cooling pathway dominates over the x - ray in this shocked system . \n this is a very significant result , upturning the traditional view that x - ray emission always dominates cooling in the later stages of evolution in compact groups of galaxies . \n the fine - structure flux ratios ( see table [ tablemetalfluxes ] ) can be used to probe the conditions within the extracted regions of sq . \n the @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82/@xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  ratio provides an indication of the sources of excitation within the system . \n as mentioned previously , @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] is mainly a tracer of hii  regions , whereas enhanced @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] emission can be generated via several mechanisms , including thermal excitation by x - rays ( xdrs ) , or in shocks . in the main shock , \n the @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82/@xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  ratio of @xmath6 4.59 is high compared to , for example , both normal galaxies ( @xmath6 1.2 ) and agn ( @xmath6 2.9 ) in the sings sample @xcite . \n however , this large aperture is contaminated by star formation emission from sq - a and the intruder galaxy . a better measure \n is given by the smaller shock sub - region , where the @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82/@xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  ratio is @xmath49 . \n thus it is clear that the @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] emission is well outside the normal range of values , even for local well - studied agn . using the upper limit found for @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48   in the `` bridge '' structure , we find a ratio of @xmath50  again values well outside the range of normal galaxy disk emission . \n indeed , these high values are typical of galactic supernova remnants where shock excitation is well determined ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n we will argue in the next section that silicon is being ionised in regions experiencing fast shocks @xmath51km@xmath0 and depleted onto dust grains . \n the @xmath10feii@xmath11$]26.0/@xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82  ratio for the main shock and sub - region ( @xmath6 0.12 ) is in agreement with values found by @xcite for their sample of snr .    for the extragalactic star forming region sq - \n a , @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82/@xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  is @xmath61.49 , only slightly higher than the average of @xmath6  1.2 found for star - forming regions in the sings sample @xcite ; another indication that sq - a is dominated by star formation .    in star - forming galaxies \n the @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56/@xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81  ratio can be used as a measure of the hardness of the radiation field as it is sensitive to the effective temperature of the ionising sources . in the main shock , \n we find a value of @xmath52 which would be considered typical compared to those found in starburst systems , which range from @xmath53 @xcite , and in supernovae remnants ranging from @xmath54 @xcite . \n the shock subregion has a ratio of only @xmath55 indicating a lower intensity radiation field north of the shock center . \n however , it is clear from its spatial distribution relative to the 8  and h@xmath5  emission , that most of the neon is not originating from star formation , and so shocks are an obvious source of excitation . \n the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81/@xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56  ratio can be used to estimate the shock velocity using the mappings shock model library of @xcite . in the main shock \n this ratio corresponds to shock speeds of between 100 and 300kms@xmath13 ( using preshock densities of @xmath56 @xmath57 and magnetic parameter @xmath58 = 1 and 3.23  the nominal equipartition value ) . \n we do , however , have contamination from starforming regions in the main shock and can not disentangle this emission from that produced in the shock . to address this we use the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81  and @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56  maps to mask areas associated with star formation ( see section 3.3 ) and determine a lower limit for the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81/@xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56  ratio in the shock of @xmath6  4.54 . \n this value corresponds to a shock velocity of @xmath6 150kms@xmath13 . \n the average electron density is determined from the @xmath10siii@xmath11$]18.71/@xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  ( two lines of the same ionisation state ) ratio . for sq - \n a we find a ratio of @xmath60.56 , and in the main shock @xmath60.41 . \n this corresponds to an electron density of @xmath59 @xmath57 @xcite for both , i.e. in the low - density limit for this diagnostic @xcite . \n our observations have shown that the molecular hydrogen and x - ray emitting plasma appear to follow a similar distribution , and we have ruled out the possibility that this is a consequence of x - rays heating the h@xmath5 , since the h@xmath5  has the dominant luminosity . \n how then can we explain the similar distributions ? \n are these results consistent with the hypothesis that the shock is formed where the intruding galaxy ngc 7318b collides with a pre - existing tidal filament of hi  drawn out of ngc 7319 in a previous interaction with another group member @xcite ? \n this basic mechanical picture appears plausible as can be seen in figure [ fig : hi+h2 ] which shows that the h@xmath5  distribution `` fills in '' the gap in the hi  tidal tail as observed by the vla @xcite . \n the implication is that the hi  has been converted into both a hot x - ray component and a warm h@xmath5  component by the collision of the intruder with the now missing hi . \n part of the puzzle of how this high - speed ( @xmath60 @xmath61 kms@xmath13 ) shock can lead to both x - ray and very strong molecular line emission is presented in a model by @xcite . \n the high - speed collision of ngc  7318b with the hi  filament ( assumed to be composed of a multiphase medium ) leads to multiple shocks passing through and compressing denser clumps ( which become dusty nucleation sites for h@xmath5  formation ) as opposed to the lower - density gas , which is shock - heated to x - ray tempertures . \n the h@xmath5  therefore forms in denser clouds experiencing slower shocks . \n thus the coexistence of both hot x - ray gas , and cooler molecular material is a natural consequence of the multiphase medium of the pre - shocked material . \n modeling of the h@xmath5  excitation by @xcite demonstrates that the emission can be reproduced by low velocity ( @xmath62 ) magnetohydrodynamic shocks within the dense ( @xmath63 ) h@xmath5  gas . \n the denser clouds survive long enough to be heated by turbulence in the hot - gas component , tapping into the large available kinetic energy of the shock . \n this picture is consistent with both the broad h@xmath5  linewidth ( 870kms@xmath13 ) measured in irs high - resolution spectrometer observations of @xcite , and the velocity center of the warm h@xmath5  ( based on new irs spectral calibrations - see appendix b ) which places the gas at intermediate velocities between the intruder and the group igm . \n both these measurements are consistent with h@xmath5  being accelerated in a turbulent post - shocked layer . \n intermediate pre - shock densities and post - shock temperatures result in regions of hi  and hii  that have cooled , but where the dust content has been destroyed @xcite . \n pre - existing giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) which may have been embedded in the hi  gas , would be rapidly compressed and collapse quickly , thus forming stars.this mechanism , proposed for sq - a by @xcite , might also apply to 7318b - south . however , if this was the case , it would have to explain why two such gmcs happened to be positioned at the extreme ends of the current shock  an unlikely coincidence . \n more probable , however , is that the geometry of the shock somehow favors the collapse of clouds at the ends of the shock  perhaps in regions where the turbulent heating is less efficient . \n as outlined above , the combination of emission detected in the shock region of sq can be understood in terms of a spectrum of shock velocities . \n the fastest shock velocities ( @xmath64 km@xmath0 ) are associated with the lowest density pre - shock regions and the post - shock x - ray emitting plasma . \n these are fast @xmath33 shocks and represent a discontinous change of hydrodynamic variables and are often dissociative @xcite . \n @xmath34 shocks have a broad transition region such that the transition from pre - shock to post - shock is continuous and are usually non - dissociative @xcite . \n the lowest velocity shocks associated with the turbulent h@xmath5  emission are @xmath62 @xmath34 shocks @xcite . \n @xcite find optical emission line ratios consistent with shock models that do not include a radiative precursor @xcite . \n the @xmath10feii@xmath11$]25.99  emission associated with the shock region in sq is relatively weak , but coincides with the most energetic part of the shock as traced by the x - rays ( fig . \n [ fig : fs ] ) . \n we also detect abundant @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82  emission associated with the main shock . \n silicon and iron have very similar first and second ionization potentials . \n their first ionization potentials ( 7.9 and 8.15  ev for fe and si , respectively ) are lower than that of hydrogen but their second ionization potential is higher ( 16.19 and 16.35  ev ) . \n the mir @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] and @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] line emission observed from the sq shock could thus arise from predominantly neutral , as well as ionized gas . \n we discuss the contribution from the ionized gas using the @xmath10feii@xmath11$](@xmath65m)/@xmath10neii@xmath11$](@xmath66 m ) and @xmath10siii@xmath11$](@xmath67m)/@xmath10neii@xmath11$](@xmath66 m ) line ratios . \n the high @xmath10neii@xmath11$](@xmath66m)/@xmath10neiii@xmath11$](@xmath68 m ) mid - ir line ratio ( see section 5 ) implies that @xmath10neii@xmath11 $ ] is the dominant ionization state of ne in the sq shock . unlike fe and si , \n ne is not much depleted on dust @xcite . \n because the @xmath10neii@xmath11$]@xmath66 m line has a high critical density ( @xmath69@xmath57 , ho and keto 2007 ) , the neon line strength scales with the emission measure of the ionised gas . \n the optical line emission from the sq shock is discussed in detail in xu et al . \n the high values of the @xmath10oi@xmath11$](6300 ) and @xmath10nii@xmath11$](6584 ) lines to h@xmath27 line ratios are evidence of shock ionization . \n the optical @xmath10sii@xmath11$](6716/6731 ) line ratio as well as the mir @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] line ratio correspond to the low density limit ( see section 5 ) and comparison with the shock models of allen et al . \n ( 2008 ) constrain the pre - shock gas density to be about @xmath70@xmath57 or smaller .    in figure \n [ fig : sil_ne ] we indicate the region ( in grey ) corresponding to the observed mir ratios ( using the upper and lower limits determined for the @xmath10neii@xmath1112.81\\mu$]m line emission as discussed in section 5 ) . \n for comparison the expected emission from the shock models of @xcite are displayed for a pre - shock gas density of @xmath70@xmath57 and two values of the magnetic parameter , @xmath58 = 0.5 and 3 . \n for clarity of the figure , only shock velocities from 100 to 300kms@xmath13 are used and higher velocities shocks which do not match the observed @xmath10neii@xmath11$]/@xmath10neiii@xmath11 $ ] line emission ratio ( see section 5 ) are discarded . \n the observed @xmath10feii@xmath11$](@xmath65m)/@xmath10neii@xmath11$](@xmath66 m ) and @xmath10siii@xmath11$](@xmath67m)/@xmath10neii@xmath11$](@xmath66 m ) ratios are both smaller than the shock values . \n the iron and silicon lines are not dominant cooling lines of ionizing shocks . \n the gas abundances of these elements do not impact the thermal structure of the shock and the line intensities roughly scale with the gas phase abundances . \n we thus interpret the offset between the irs observation and model values as evidence for fe and si depletion . \n we consider the magnitude of the depletions indicated by the arrow ( @xmath650% and @xmath660% for fe and si , respectively ) in figure [ fig : sil_ne ] as lower limits since there could be a contribution to the @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] and @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] line emission from non - ionizing @xmath33-shocks into molecular gas @xcite . \n such shocks could also contribute to the @xmath10oi@xmath11$](6300 ) line emission as discussed in guillard et al . \n forthcoming observations of the h@xmath9 ro - vibrational line emission in the near - ir should allow us to estimate whether they may be significant . a contribution from non - ionizing shocks to the @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] and @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] line emission will raise the depletion of both fe and si as well as the fe / si depletion ratio because non - ionizing shocks do not produce @xmath10neii@xmath11 $ ] line emission and the @xmath10feii@xmath11$](@xmath71m)/@xmath10siii@xmath11$](@xmath72 m ) line emission ratio in @xmath33-shocks within dense gas is larger than for shocks plotted in figure [ fig : sil_ne ] .      a key aspect to understanding the emission we observe in sq , as well as a test of the proposed model of h@xmath5  excitation , is the amount and distribution of cold h@xmath5 , as measured by co. a reservoir of cold h@xmath5  associated with the warm gas observed in sq would provide key insight into conditions within the intragroup medium . in figure [ fig : co ] \n we show the bima co ( 1 - 0 ) integrated intensity contours from @xcite , shown with the h@xmath5  s(0 ) and s(1 ) emission contours , overlaid on an optical image of sq . \n these interferometric observations use the large primary beam of 110 , centered on the shock , to determine areas of high column densities in the group . \n the co traces areas of known star formation seen at 24  and in the nuv ( see section [ sf ] ) , notably sq - a and 7318b - south . as observed by @xcite , the co around ngc 7319 \n is concentrated in two regions . \n the dominant complex is north of the nucleus residing in a dusty tidal feature . \n the nuclear co is elongated perpendicular to the stellar disk suggesting a deficiency of ongoing star formation in the disk . \n the co distribution does not correlate with the location of warm h@xmath5  emission , particularly around ngc 7319 . \n the cold h@xmath5  complexes are clearly offset from the concentrations of warm h@xmath9 . \n even the s(0 ) emission line ( see fig . \n [ fig : co]a ) , which follows the coldest warm h@xmath9 , does not have peaks corresponding to the strongest co detections . in a forthcoming paper ( guillard et al . \n 2010 , in preparation ) , we will report the recent detection of @xmath73co(1 - 0 ) and ( 2 - 1 ) emission , associated with the warm h@xmath9 in the sq shock , using the single - dish 30 m iram telescope . \n these observations suggest that most of the co emission in the shock has been missed by interferometers ( because of the broad linewidth ) and show that the co emission is both present in the shock , and extends along the h@xmath9-emitting bridge and towards ngc 7319 . \n the kinematics of the co gas lying outside of star - forming regions , in the new observations , appears to be highly disturbed with a broad linewidth in agreement with the appleton et al . \n ( 2006 ) interpretation that the mir h@xmath5  lines were intrinsically very broad and resolved by the high resolution module of irs . \n the co data also agrees with our re - analysis of the appleton et al . \n ( 2006 ) data ( see appendix b ) using more recent and reliable wavelength calibration , which places the bulk of the h@xmath5  gas at velocities intermediate to that of the intruder and the group  supporting the idea that the h@xmath5  gas is accelerated in the shock . \n section [ sf ] discussed the star forming regions observed in sq and noted that there was very little evidence for star formation in the shock associated with the warm h@xmath5  emission . \n the main shock contains a large quantity of warm molecular hydrogen ( 5.0 @xmath210@xmath43m@xmath44 ) providing a reservoir of fuel for star formation once it cools ( see section [ spec ] ) . \n we investigate star formation in the warm h@xmath9-dominated medium by considering the shock sub - region , chosen to avoid star forming regions in the intruder galaxy , but likely still subject to some contamination from these regions . \n pah emission is a classical tracer of star formation , but the molecules are fragile and easily destroyed in hard radiation fields . in the spectra of the main shock and subregion ( fig . \n [ fig : spectra]a and b ) the pah emission bands at 6.2 , 7.7  and 8.6  are far weaker compared to the 11.3  bands , which when strong are predominantly produced by neutral pah molecules @xcite . in the shock subregion we find an upper limit flux for the 6.2  pah of @xmath74 wm@xmath75 and fluxes of @xmath76 wm@xmath75 and @xmath77 wm@xmath75 for the 7.7 and 11.3  bands respectively . \n this corresponds to a 7.7/11.3  pah ratio of 0.35 , very low compared to the median value found for the sings sample of 3.6 @xcite . \n the suppression of the 7.7/11.3  pah ratio has been observed in agn environments ( e.g. low - luminosity agn in the sings sample of * ? ? ? * ) and is favored to be the result of selective destruction of pah molecules small enough to emit at 7.7 . \n pah processing in the shock due to larger molecules being less fragile than smaller ones is discussed further in guillard et al . \n an alternative explanation is that the pah molecules are chiefly large and neutral in the shock , producing enhanced 11.3  emission in comparison to the smaller pah molecules . \n a detailed comparison of the dust and pah emission properties can be found in guillard et al . \n ( 2010 ) . \n dust emission in the mid- and far - infrared can be used to infer the amount of star formation taking place @xcite . \n we measure a 24  flux in this region of 0.408 mjy , corresponding to a spectral luminosity ( @xmath78 ) of @xmath79 . \n this low luminosity is consistent with the weak mir continuum ( fig . \n [ fig : spectra]b ) , arising from emission from vsgs heated by the uv radiation field . \n we can combine this with a measurement of the h@xmath27 emission in this region to obtain a star formation rate ( sfr ) , given that they are complimentary ( h@xmath27 tracing the young stellar population and 24  as a measure of dust - absorbed stellar light ) . \n we find @xmath80 , but caution that h@xmath27 emission in sq is also the result of shock - excitation @xcite and must be considered an upper limit for measuring star formation . when we combine @xmath81 with @xmath82 , using the relation of @xcite , we find a sfr of @xmath290.05@xmath83 \n .    a further measure of star formation can be obtained from the pah strength . using the relation of @xcite , derived from the starburst sample of @xcite \n , we can use the 7.7  flux density as a measure of star formation . \n the shock subregion has a 7.7  flux density of 0.73 mjy which corresponds to a sfr of @xmath84 , in good agreement with our previous calculation , but also an upper limit as some pah emission is contamination from known star formation regions in the group . a point of caution \n , however , is that this star formation indicator may be biased given that we detect suppressed 7.7  emission compared to the 11.3  pah . \n comparing the @xmath85(7.7)/@xmath82 ratio to the galaxies in sings , we find that the value of @xmath86 is typical of star - forming galaxies @xcite , which suggests that both measures of star formation are low , but self - consistent . \n the low _ upper limits _ for the sfr in the shock suggests that star formation is depressed in the shock apart from in the igm starburst , sq - a , which has a sfr of @xmath87 at the velocity of the group @xcite \n . this would be consistent with a picture of molecular hydrogen being reheated by mhd shocks in the turbulent medium . \n since the jeans mass increases with gas temperature and turbulence and shearing morions will prevent collapse , the cold molecular gas clouds may be too short - lived or undersized to facilitate collapse and produce significant star formation @xcite . \n the extent of a cold reservoir of molecular gas in the shock is a key consideration in this scenario , as discussed in section [ co ] . \n the present observations suggest that molecular line cooling in dense clumps dissipates a significant fraction of the kinetic energy available in high - speed shocks . for reference , and to provide a glimpse of what this group might look like at high redshift when filling a single beam , we present in figure [ fig : full ] the spectrum extracted for the entire group ( i.e. including the three neighboring galaxies and the shock ) . \n the total h@xmath5  line emission from the whole group exceeds @xmath8 and is still the most dominant mir coolant . \n indeed the luminosity of the rotational h@xmath5  lines is sufficient that it could be detected at high redshift with future far - infrared or sub - mm instrumentation like spica or safir ( see appleton et al . \n how likely is it , however , that high - speed shocks play a role in the assembly of galaxies ? \n there is growing evidence that galaxies at high redshift are turbulent @xcite and increasingly clumpy ( e.g. conselice et al . \n 2005 , elmegreen & elmegreen 2005 ) . \n indeed bournaud & elmegreen ( 2009 ) discuss the importance of the growth instabilities in massive gas clumps in forming disks at z  @xmath88  1 , and favor at least a large fraction of the clump systems being formed in smooth flows , perhaps similar to those discussed by dekel et al . \n to what extent the build - up of these disks is truly `` smooth '' is not yet clear since the medium is likely to be a multiphase one . in a more standard picture , gas flowing into the more massive dark halos will experience strong shocks , most likely in an inhomogenious medium ( e. g. greif et al . \n 2008 )  thus it begs the question of how important h@xmath9 cooling may be in these different cases . \n models of the collapse of the first structures predict that strong metal lines soon dominate the cooling over molecular hydrogen when the first stars pollute the environment . \n it is therefore usually assumed that , except at very early stages , molecular hydrogen is a minority coolant in gas that forms the first major structures ( e.g. bromm et al . \n 2001 , santoro and shull 2006 ) . \n however , our observations show that , under the right conditions , even in high metallicity environments , molecular hydrogen can be extremely powerful  in this case dominating by a factor of ten over the usually powerful @xmath10siii@xmath1134.82 \\mu$]m line in strong shocks . \n if there are situations at high redshift where strong shocks propagate into a clumpy , multiphase medium , then our observations imply that molecular hydrogen cooling can not be assumed to be negligible . on the other hand \n , this will not be a trivial problem . \n our best model of stephan s quintet @xcite involves the formation of h@xmath5  in a complex multiphase turbulent medium in which shocks destroy dust in some places , but allow survival in others - thus encouraging h@xmath5  formation .    in the early universe , this enhanced cooling , \n which has so far been neglected , will depend on the distribution and nature of the first dust grains , in concert with the formation , temperature and abundance of gas , and the feedback effects from the first stars and agn . \n in this paper we have presented the results of the mid - infrared spectral mapping of the stephan s quintet system using the _ spitzer space telescope_. we highlight here our five main conclusions :    * the powerful h@xmath5  emission detected by @xcite surprisingly represents only a small fraction of the group - wide warm h@xmath5  ( with a lower limit luminosity of @xmath89 spread over @xmath90 kpc@xmath7 ) that dominates the mid - infrared emission of the system . \n there is evidence for another shock - excited feature , the so - called h@xmath5  bridge between the main shock and ngc 7319 , which is likely a remnant of past tidal interactions within the group . \n the spatial variation in the distribution of the h@xmath5  0 - 0 line ratios implies differences in temperature and excitation in the shocked system - this will be explored fully in paper ii . * \n the global l(h@xmath5)/l@xmath91 ratio in the main shock is @xmath92 , and @xmath62.5 in the new `` bridge '' feature . \n the results confirm that mir h@xmath9 lines are a stronger coolant than x - ray emission over the shock structures , indicating a new cooling pathway seen on a large scale in sq . \n this modifies the traditional view that x - rays dominate cooling at all times in the later stages of compact group evolution . since h@xmath5  forms on the surfaces of dust grains , we expect dust emission associated with these regions , but a low intensity radiation field produces only weak emission at 24 . \n * following earlier interpretations of nebular line ratios in the optical , we interpret infrared ionic lines within the framework of fast ( @xmath93 km@xmath0 ) ionizing shocks . \n comparison between the @xmath10neii@xmath11 $ ] , @xmath10neiii@xmath11 $ ] , @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] and @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] line intensities implies that both silicon and iron are depleted onto dust . \n this result implies that dust is not destroyed in the shock . \n * star formation in sq is dominated by sq - a and 7318b - south , located at the extreme ends of the shock ridge seen at radio wavelengths , suggesting they are both shock triggered starbursts . \n however , regions dominated by warm h@xmath5  emission exhibit very low star formation rates , consistent with a turbulent model where h@xmath5  is significantly reheated and cool clouds are too short -

ray emission @xcite and is prominent at radio wavelengths @xcite . \n however , we observe an offset between the peak of the h@xmath5  emission near ngc 7319 and the seyfert nucleus , which suggests that the `` bridge '' is a separate structure and not being excited by the agn . \n the agn in ngc 7319 does not have a well - collimated jet , but two extended lobes with compact hotspots , asymetrically distributed along the minor axis of the galaxy @xcite . \n this structure runs ne / sw and its orientation compared to the h@xmath5  filament ( which runs ew ) is not consistent with causing the excitation of the h@xmath5  bridge . \n this is also evident from the relatively weak power in the agn , as inferred by the emission line diagnostics discussed below , and in the x - ray where it is only a factor of @xmath62 greater than the emission associated with the main shock and `` bridge '' . in figure \n [ fig : fs ] we present the specific intensity contours of the @xmath10feii@xmath11$]25.99  ( blended with @xmath10oiv@xmath11$]25.89@xmath25 m ) , @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  and @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82  emission lines . given the low spectral resolution of the sl and ll modules of _ \n spitzer _ , we can not distinguish between emission from @xmath10fe ii@xmath11 $ ] and @xmath10oiv@xmath11 $ ] . \n the agn in ngc 7319 is likely to produce both , with @xmath10feii@xmath11 $ ] emission likely originating in x - ray dissociation regions ( xdrs ) surrounding the agn @xcite . \n prominent emission from @xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  and @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.82  are due to the high excitation conditions associated with the agn . \n dense pdrs and x - ray dominated regions , powered by agn , show strong @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] emission at 34.82 , while @xmath10siii@xmath11 $ ] 33.48  emission acts as a tracer of hii  regions . \n we now focus on the emission line properties of ngc 7319 . \n figure [ fig : agn ] shows the spectrum extracted from the galaxy and the measured properties of the line ratios are listed in table [ tableh2fluxes ] and [ tablemetalfluxes ] . \n for the first time in the sq group , we observe a spectrum which is no longer dominated by h@xmath5  emission , but instead the brightest lines are the high - excitation @xmath10oiv@xmath11$]25.91@xmath25 m and @xmath10feii@xmath11$]25.98  blended lines , as well as the @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.81@xmath25 m line . @xmath10nev@xmath11 $ ] is prominent at both 14.32  and 24.30@xmath25 m  a line typically seen in agn . also , unlike the majority of the extended shocked regions , there is a rising thermal continuum more typical of a starforming galaxy than a classical seyfert galaxy , although as various studies have shown ( buchanan et al . 2006 ; deo et al . 2007 ) , seyfert ii galaxies exhibit a variety of mir spectral characteristics at long wavelengths . \n ngc  7319 s rising continuum is similar to that seen in the seyfert ii galaxy ngc  3079 ( deo et al . \n 2007 ) , and likely represents a dominant starburst component in the far - ir . \n spitzer imaging reveals not only a bright nucleus , but also extended emission regions in the galaxy . using the @xmath10siii@xmath11$]34.81@xmath25m/@xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  ratio as a probe of excitation sources \n , we find a ratio of @xmath61.85 which is low compared to the average value found for agn galaxies ( @xmath94 ) in the _ spitzer _ infrared nearby galaxy sample ( sings ) , but high compared to star - forming regions ( @xmath95 ) in the same sample @xcite . \n this suggests a relatively weak agn . the @xmath10neiii@xmath11$]15.56/@xmath10neii@xmath11$]12.81  ratio is a measure of radiation field strength and the value of 0.97 indicates a typical radiation field strength compared to other agn ( the sample of weedman et al . \n 2005 shows a range of @xmath60.17 to 1.9 ) . the average electron density , estimated from the @xmath10siii@xmath11$]18.71/@xmath10siii@xmath11$]33.48  ratio of @xmath60.56 , is @xmath59 @xmath57 @xcite , in the low - density limit for this diagnostic @xcite . \n the properties of the h@xmath5  emission of ngc  7319 are limited to the two long wavelength lines observed by irs - ll ( the galaxy lies outside the region mapped by sl ) . as a result , \n the excitation diagram contains only two points allowing only an approximate idea of the h@xmath5  mass , since without the sl wavelength coverage to provide information on possible warmer components , we are likely to overestimate the temperature of the h@xmath5  by fitting a straight line to the points . any warmer component would contribute to the flux of the 0 - 0 s(1 ) line thus leading to a reduction of the temperature ( and increase in h@xmath5  mass ) for any cooler component . however , to provide a guide , we estimate the temperature of h@xmath5  @xmath96171@xmath97 k ( assuming the gas is in thermal equilibrium and thus an ortho - para ratio of 2.65 ) and a total h@xmath5  mass of 3.0@xmath9810@xmath3m@xmath4 . \n we consider this a lower limit to the total warm mass if ( as is likely ) more than one component is present . \n gao & xu ( 2000 ) estimated the _ cold _ molecular hydrogen mass of ngc 7319 based on @xmath73co ( 1 - 0 ) observations as @xmath88 3.6  @xmath210@xmath99m@xmath4 , a factor of roughly ten greater than the warm h@xmath5  mass . \n such a ratio is not atypical of large spiral galaxies @xcite . \n the high resolution spectrum at the center of the shock in sq , obtained by @xcite , has been reanalysed using the latest calibrations available for the irs instrument ( ssc pipeline version s17 ) and is included as figure [ fig : hr ] . \n this has shown that the h@xmath5  gas lies at a velocity of 6360(@xmath100100 ) km s@xmath13 , between the velocity of the group ( 6600 kms@xmath13 ) and the velocity of the intruder ( 5700 kms@xmath13 ) . \n this is consistent with a model of gas being accelerated by the shock , as well as the turbulence demonstrated by the broad linewidth of the h@xmath5  in the shock ( 860 kms@xmath13 ) . \n the new sh spectrum shows that with the improved calibrations , the 11.3  pah feature is detected , although faint . \n this is consistent with what is found in the larger extractions that show enhanced 11.3  pah emission compared to ionised pah features emitting at 6.2  and 7.7 . \n in this section we present the x - ray fluxes in the extraction regions shown in figure [ fig : ext ] . \n the reanalysis of archival data is necessary to obtain accurate fluxes and luminosities for the x - ray emission over the various apertures matched to our spectral extractions . \n we use the xmm - newton epic - pn data ( see * ? ? ? \n * for observational details ) to obtain the most sensitive measurements . \n a calibrated event file was generated and filtered using standard quality flags , and subsequently cleaned of background flares . \n a 0.32  kev image was then extracted and corrected for instrumental response . \n all point - like sources were masked out to @xmath101 in the analysis of diffuse emission , and the local background level was estimated within a @xmath102  arcmin@xmath7 rectangular region away from the group core . for each region in fig . \n 7 , resulting background - subtracted photon count rates were converted to 0.32  kev and  bolometric \" ( 0.00110  kev ) x - ray fluxes assuming an absorbed thermal plasma model of metallicity 0.4 solar , with temperature as estimated from the map of osullivan et al . \n ( 2009 ) , and an absorbing galactic hi column density of @xmath103  @xmath47 . for ngc7319 , which harbors an agn , an absorbed power - law spectrum of photon index @xmath104 was assumed instead . \n results are listed in table [ x - ray ] . \n lcccc + region & count rate ( 0.3 - 2 kev ) & flux ( 0.3 - 2 kev ) & bolometric flux ( 0.001 -

        "abstract": "Stephan’s Quintet, a compact group of galaxies, exhibits large-scale shocks from high-velocity collisions, revealing extensive warm molecular hydrogen (H₂) emission using Spitzer. The H₂ emission, with a total luminosity surpassing X-rays, dominates cooling pathways and spans 480 kpc. Notable features include a second shock likely from prior interactions and iron and silicon depletion in fast shocks. While star formation occurs at shock ends, turbulent energy in the main ridge suppresses it. These findings highlight the pivotal role of H₂ cooling in galaxy-scale shocks and early galaxy formation."

bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 , if exists , is of length @xmath19 and its suffix of length @xmath20 is identical to its prefix of length @xmath20 . \n so , sometimes a de - bruijn sequence is written in a circular form by omitting the last @xmath20 letters , which can be viewed as the equivalence class of words under the conjugate relation . \n the de  bruijn sequence is also called the de  bruijn - good sequence , named after de  bruijn  @xcite and good  @xcite who independently studied the existence of such words over binary alphabet ; the former also provided a formula @xmath21 for the total number of those words of order @xmath1 . \n the study of the de  bruijn sequence , however , dates back at least to 1894 , when flye  sainte - marie  @xcite studied the words and provided the same formula @xmath21 . for an arbitrary alphabet @xmath14 , van  aardenne - ehrenfest and de  bruijn   provided the formula @xmath22 for the total number of de  bruijn sequences of order @xmath1 . \n besides the total number of de  bruijn sequences , another interesting topic is how to generate a de  bruijn sequence ( arbitrary one , lexicographically least one , lexicographically largest one ) . for generating de  bruijn sequences , \n see the surveys  @xcite . \n the de  bruijn sequence is some times called the full cycle  @xcite , and has connections to the following concepts : feedback shift registers  @xcite , normal words  @xcite , generating random binary sequences  @xcite , primitive polynomials over a galois field  @xcite , lyndon words and necklaces  , euler tours and spanning trees  .    in this paper \n , we consider a generalization of the de  bruijn sequence . to understand the concept , let us return to the glass pipe game presented at the beginning . \n now the trap - door can support more weight . \n when there are @xmath23 or more balls in the pipe , the trap - door opens and the balls drop off until there are only @xmath1 balls in the pipe . \n is there an arrangement of putting the balls such that every @xmath1 ball sequence appears exactly once in the pipe ? \n the answer is `` yes '' for arbitrary positive integers @xmath24 . \n the solution represents a multi - shift de  bruijn sequence . \n we will discuss the existence of the multi - shift de  bruijn sequence , the total number of multi - shift de  bruijn sequences , generating a multi - shift de  bruijn sequence , and the application of the multi - shift de  bruijn sequence in the frobenius problem in a free monoid . \n let @xmath25 be the _ alphabet _ and let @xmath26 be a word over @xmath14 . \n the _ length _ of @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath27 and the _ factor _ @xmath28 of @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath29 . if @xmath30 for some non - negative integer @xmath31 , we say factor @xmath32 appears in @xmath0 at _ a modulo @xmath2 position_. the set of all words of length @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath15 and the set of all finite words is denoted by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the _ \n empty word_. the concatenation of two words @xmath35 is denoted by @xmath36 , or simply @xmath37 . \n a word @xmath0 over @xmath14 is called a _ multi - shift de  bruijn sequence _ of shift @xmath2 and order @xmath1 , if each word in @xmath15 appears exactly once in @xmath0 as a factor at a modulo @xmath2 position . \n for example , one of the @xmath17-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath38 is @xmath39 , which can be verified as follows : @xmath40 the multi - shift de  bruijn sequence generalizes the de  bruijn sequence in the sense de  bruijn sequences are exactly @xmath41-shift de  bruijn sequences of the same order . \n it is easy to see that the length of each @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 , if exists , is equal to @xmath42 . by the definition of multi - shift de  bruijn sequence , the following proposition holds . \n [ lemma : circular ] let @xmath0 be one @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence @xmath0 of order @xmath1 , @xmath43 . then the suffix of length @xmath44 of @xmath0 is identical to the prefix of length @xmath44 of @xmath0 . \n let @xmath0 be one @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence @xmath0 of order @xmath1 over @xmath14 and let @xmath45 . \n write @xmath46 such that @xmath47 . \n if @xmath48 , then we compare the set of all factors @xmath49 and the set of all factors @xmath50 for @xmath51 . \n the former covers factors @xmath52 and the latter covers factors @xmath53 for every @xmath54 . since the two are identical , we have @xmath55 . \n now we assume @xmath56 . \n consider the set of all factors @xmath57 and the set of all factors @xmath58 for @xmath51 and @xmath59 . by the same argument \n , we have @xmath60 for @xmath61 . \n finally , comparing the set of all @xmath62 and the set of all @xmath63 for @xmath51 , we have the equality @xmath64 . \n therefore , we have the equality @xmath65 .    from proposition  [ lemma : circular ] , we know that when @xmath43 , every multi - shift de  bruijn sequence can be written as a circular word and the discussion on multi - shift de  bruijn sequences of the two different forms are equivalent . in this paper , we discuss the multi - shift de  bruijn sequence in the form of ordinary words .    a _ ( non - strict ) directed graph _ , or _ digraph _ for short , is a triple @xmath66 consisting of a set @xmath67 of _ vertices _ , a set @xmath68 of _ arcs _ , and an _ incidence function _ @xmath69 . \n here we do not take the convention @xmath70 , since we allow a digraph contains self - loops and multiple arcs regarding the same pair of vertices . \n when @xmath71 , we say the arc @xmath9 joins @xmath32 to @xmath72 , where vertex @xmath73 and vertex @xmath74 are called _ tail _ and _ head _ , respectively . \n the indegree @xmath75 ( outdegree @xmath76 , respectively ) of a vertex @xmath72 is the number of arcs with @xmath72 being the head ( the tail , respectively ) . \n a _ walk _ in @xmath77 is a sequence @xmath78 such that @xmath79 for each @xmath80 . \n the walk is _ closed _ , if @xmath81 . \n two closed walks are regarded as identical if one is the circular shift of the other . an _ \n euler tour _ is a closed walk that traverses each arc exactly once . \n hamilton cycle _ is a closed walk that traverses each vertex exactly once \n . an _ ( spanning ) arborescence _ is a digraph with a particular vertex , called the _ root _ \n , such that it contains every vertices of @xmath77 , its number of arcs is exactly one less than the number of vertices , and there is exactly one walk from the root to any other vertex . \n we denote the total number of euler tours , hamilton cycles , and arborescence of @xmath77 by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , respectively . \n an _ ( undirected ) graph _ is defined as a digraph such that for any pair of vertices @xmath85 , there is an arc @xmath9 , @xmath86 , if and only if there is a corresponding arc @xmath87 , @xmath88 . in this case \n , we write @xmath89 and a spanning arborescence is just a _ spanning tree_.    the arc - graph @xmath90 of @xmath66 is defined as @xmath91 such that for every pair of arcs @xmath92 , @xmath93 , there is an arc @xmath94 , @xmath95 and those arcs are the only arcs in @xmath96 . \n euler tours exist in a graph @xmath77 if and only if hamilton cycles exist in the arc - graph @xmath90 . \n we define the word graph @xmath97 by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 for @xmath100 . then by definition , the following lemmas are straightforward . \n [ lemma : arcgraph ] the digraph @xmath101 is the digraph @xmath102 .    by definition , @xmath103 where @xmath104 , and @xmath105 so for every pair of arcs @xmath106 of @xmath97 with @xmath107 , there is an arc @xmath108 of @xmath102 ; and for every arc @xmath109 of @xmath102 , @xmath110 hence , by definition , @xmath102 is the arc - graph of @xmath97 . \n [ lemma : equivalent ] suppose @xmath111 . \n ( 1 ) there is a @xmath112-to-@xmath41 mapping from the set of @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequences of order @xmath1 onto the set of hamilton cycles in @xmath97 . \n ( 2 ) there is a @xmath112-to-@xmath41 mapping from the set of @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequences of order @xmath1 onto the set of euler tours in @xmath113 . \n let @xmath114 . \n ( 1 ) notice that any hamilton cycle @xmath115 together with a starting arc @xmath116 uniquely determines one @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequences of order @xmath1 specified by @xmath117 and vice versa . \n so the @xmath118-to-@xmath41 mapping exists . \n ( 2 ) applying lemma  [ lemma : arcgraph ] , this part follows from ( 1 ) .    [ \n theorem : existence ] for any alphabet @xmath14 , positive integers @xmath24 , the @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequences of order @xmath1 over @xmath14 exist . \n first we assume @xmath119 . \n let @xmath120 be any permutation of the words in @xmath15 for @xmath114 . \n then the word @xmath121 is one @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 over @xmath14 . \n now we assume @xmath122 and prove there exists an euler tour in @xmath113 . \n then by lemma  [ lemma : equivalent ] , the existence of @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequences of order @xmath1 over @xmath14 is ensured . to show the existence of an euler tour , we only need to verify that @xmath113 is connected and that @xmath123 for every vertex @xmath72 , both of which are straightforward : for every vertex @xmath72 in @xmath113 , @xmath72 is connected to the vertex @xmath124 in both directions and @xmath125 . \n since @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 exists , in this section we discuss the total number of different @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 , and we denote the number by @xmath126 . \n first , we study the degenerated case . \n [ lemma : countnlesm ] for @xmath6 , @xmath127 , where @xmath45 . \n let @xmath45 . by the definition of the multi - shift de  bruijn sequence , in the case @xmath6 , @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequences of order @xmath1 \n are exactly those of the form @xmath128 , where @xmath129 and @xmath120 is a permutation of all words in @xmath15 . \n therefore , the total number of such words is @xmath5 .    to study the case @xmath8 \n , we need a theorem by van  aardenne - ehrenfest and de  bruijn  , which describes the relation between the number of euler tours in a particular type of digraph and the number of euler tours in its arc - graph .    [ \n theorem : ehrenfestbruijn ] let @xmath66 be a digraph such that @xmath130 for every @xmath131 \n . then @xmath132 . \n the digraph @xmath97 satisfies the conditions in theorem  [ theorem : ehrenfestbruijn ] with @xmath133 . \n so , by the relation between the multi - shift de  bruijn sequences and the euler tours in the word graph @xmath97 , we have the following recursive expression on @xmath126 . \n [ lemma : recursion ] for @xmath134 , @xmath135 , where @xmath45 , @xmath136 . \n let @xmath45 , @xmath136 . by lemma  [ lemma : \n equivalent ] , @xmath137    to finish the last step of obtaining @xmath126 for @xmath8 , we again need two theorems , which are often used in the literature to count the number of euler tours in various types of digraphs .    [ \n theorem : best ] in a digraph @xmath66 , @xmath138 . \n [ theorem : kirchhoff ] in a graph @xmath66 , the number of spanning trees is equal to any cofactor of the laplacian matrix of @xmath77 , which is the diagonal matrix of degrees minus the adjacency matrix . \n [ lemma : countnles2 m ] for @xmath139 , @xmath140 , where @xmath45 . \n let @xmath141 and @xmath45 . \n then @xmath142 . by definition , \n so from any vertex to any vertex , there are @xmath144-many arcs in @xmath77 . \n we convert @xmath77 into a undirected graph @xmath145 by omitting all self - loops ; there are @xmath144-many of them for each vertex . \n since for every pair of vertices @xmath85 there are @xmath144-many arcs joins @xmath146 to @xmath147 and correspondingly there are @xmath144-many arcs joins @xmath147 to @xmath146 , the graph @xmath145 is indeed an undirected graph by our definition . \n each vertex in @xmath145 is of degree @xmath148 . \n then the laplacian matrix of @xmath145 is @xmath149 by theorem  [ theorem : kirchhoff ] , the number of arborescence @xmath150 is equal to the cofactor of @xmath151 , which is @xmath152 \n . then by theorem  [ theorem : best ] , the number of euler tours in digraph @xmath77 is @xmath153 . \n finally , by lemma  [ lemma : equivalent ] , the number of @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 is @xmath154 . \n [ theorem : count ] for @xmath6 , @xmath127 , and for @xmath155 , @xmath140 , where @xmath45 .    for @xmath6 , the equality @xmath127 is shown in lemma  [ lemma : countnlesm ] . \n now we assume @xmath156 . \n let @xmath136 . \n then by lemmas  [ lemma : recursion],[lemma : countnles2 m ] , we have @xmath157 . \n in this section , we study the problem of generating one @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 for arbitrary alphabet and positive integers @xmath24 . when @xmath6 , a @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 is easy to construct as given in theorem  [ theorem : existence ] . \n now we consider the case @xmath158 . \n we will present two algorithms for generating a @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 . \n we claim that @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequences of order @xmath159 can be generated using the ordinary de  bruijn sequence generating algorithm , such as described by fredricksen  @xcite . \n to do this , we first generate a de  bruijn sequence @xmath0 of order @xmath160 over the alphabet @xmath161 . \n then we replace each letter of @xmath0 in @xmath162 by the corresponding word of length @xmath2 over @xmath14 . \n it is easy to see that the new word is a @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath159 . \n the first algorithm of generating multi - shift de  bruijn sequence is to generate @xmath163-shift de  bruijn sequences of order @xmath164 for @xmath165 before rearranging the words to obtain an arbitrary @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 . \n let @xmath166 be two integers , and @xmath46 , where @xmath136 . \n the case @xmath167 is already discussed and the case @xmath168 is trivial . \n so we assume @xmath169 and @xmath170 . \n we define @xmath171 , @xmath172 and generate @xmath173 such that @xmath174 is a @xmath175-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath176 and @xmath177 ; and define @xmath178 , @xmath179 and generate @xmath180 such that @xmath181 is a @xmath182-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath183 and @xmath184 . \n let @xmath45 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 . \n we define @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 . \n then the following word @xmath191 is one @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 , where @xmath192 and @xmath193 .    to show the correctness \n , we claim that every word in @xmath194 appears in @xmath195 as a factor at a modulo @xmath2 position exactly once . \n furthermore , since @xmath196 , every word in @xmath197 appears in @xmath198 as a factor at a modulo @xmath2 position exactly once . \n therefore , the generated word is indeed a @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 . \n now , we will see an example . \n consider generating a @xmath17-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath199 . \n then @xmath200 and we can obtain two words @xmath201 , which is @xmath202 , and @xmath203 , which is @xmath204 . \n so one @xmath17-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath199 is as follows @xmath205 where the subscripts @xmath41 and @xmath17 denote whether the letter is from the word @xmath206 ( words @xmath207 ) or from the word @xmath208 ( words @xmath209 ) . \n now we present the second algorithm , which uses the same idea of `` prefer one '' algorithm  @xcite for generating ordinary de  bruijn sequences . \n let @xmath24 be two positive integers . \n the following algorithm generates a @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 :    1 . \n start the sequence @xmath0 with @xmath1 zeros ; 2 . \n append to the end of current sequence @xmath0 the lexicographically largest word of length @xmath2 such that the suffix of length @xmath1 of new sequence has not yet appeared as factor at a modulo @xmath2 position ; 3 .   repeat the last step until no word can be added .    to show the correctness \n , first we claim that when the algorithm stops , the suffix @xmath32 of length @xmath44 of @xmath0 contains only zeros . to see this , \n suppose @xmath32 is not @xmath124 . \n since no word can be added , all @xmath210 words of length @xmath1 with prefix @xmath32 appear in @xmath0 and thus @xmath32 appears in @xmath0 as a factor at a modulo @xmath2 position @xmath211 times . \n so there are @xmath211 words of length @xmath1 with suffix @xmath32 that appear in @xmath0 at a modulo @xmath2 position , which contradicts the definition of the multi - shift de  bruijn sequence . therefore , @xmath212 \n furthermore , word @xmath124 appears in @xmath0 as a factor at a modulo @xmath2 position @xmath211 times and thus all words in @xmath213 appear in @xmath0 as a factor at a modulo @xmath2 position . by the algorithm \n , no word of length @xmath1 can appear twice in @xmath0 at a modulo position . \n so , in order to prove the correctness of the algorithm , it remains to show every word of length @xmath1 appears in @xmath0 as a factor at a modulo @xmath2 position . \n suppose a word @xmath72 does not appear in @xmath0 at a modulo @xmath2 position . \n then @xmath214 and the word @xmath215 does not appear in @xmath0 as a factor at a modulo @xmath2 position as well ; otherwise , there are @xmath216 appearance of @xmath217 in @xmath0 at a modulo @xmath2 position , which means @xmath72 appears in @xmath0 as a factor at a modulo @xmath2 position . \n repeat this procedure , none of the words @xmath215 , \n @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 appears in @xmath0 as a factor at a modulo @xmath2 position . but \n for @xmath221 , we proved that @xmath222 appears in @xmath0 as a factor at a modulo @xmath2 position , a contradiction . \n therefore , every word of length @xmath1 appears at a modulo @xmath2 position . \n now , we use the algorithm to generate one @xmath17-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath199 . starting from @xmath223 , since @xmath224 does not appear as a factor at a modulo @xmath17 position , we append @xmath225 to the current sequence @xmath223 . repeating this procedure and appending words \n @xmath225 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath225 ,  , finally we obtain the word : @xmath227    if we circularly move the prefix @xmath228 to the end , the sequence generated by the second algorithm is the lexicographically largest @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 . \n the study of multi - shift de  bruijn sequences is inspired by a problems of words , called the frobenius problem in a free monoid . given @xmath160 integers @xmath229 , such that @xmath230 , then there are only finitely many positive integers that _ can not _ be written as a non - negative integer linear combination of @xmath229 . \n the integer _ \n frobenius problem _ is to find the largest such integer , which is denoted by @xmath231 . \n for example , @xmath232 .    if words @xmath229 , instead of integers , are given such that there are only finitely many words that _ can not _ be written as concatenation of words from the set @xmath233 , the _ frobenius problem in a free monoid _ \n @xcite is to find the longest such words . \n if all @xmath229 are of length either @xmath2 or @xmath1 , @xmath234 , there is an upper bound : the length of the longest word that can not be written as concatenation of words from the set @xmath233 is less than or equal to @xmath235 , where @xmath236 . \n @xcite furthermore , the upper bound is tight and the construction is based on the multi - shift de  bruijn sequences . \n we denote the set of all words that can be written as concatenation of words in @xmath237 , including the empty word , by @xmath238 . \n @xcite there exists @xmath239 , @xmath234 , such that @xmath240 is finite and the longest words in @xmath240 constitute exactly the language @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is a @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath44 . \n for example , for any set of words @xmath243 such that @xmath244 is finite , the longest words in @xmath244 are of length less than or equal to @xmath245 . to construct @xmath237 to reach the upper bound , \n we first choose an anbitrary @xmath38-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath246 as @xmath247 . then based on @xmath242 \n , we construct the set @xmath248 @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 , @xmath254 , @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 , @xmath262 , @xmath263 @xmath264 . \n we have @xmath265 and one of the longest words in @xmath151 of length exactly @xmath266 is given below : @xmath267 \n in this paper , we generalized the classic de  bruijn sequence to a new multi - shift setting . \n a word @xmath0 is a @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence @xmath268 of order @xmath1 , if each word of length @xmath1 appears exactly once as a factor at a modulo @xmath2 position . \n an ordinary de  bruijn sequence is a @xmath41-shift de  bruijn sequence . \n we showed the total number of distinct @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequences of order @xmath1 is @xmath269 for @xmath6 and is @xmath140 for @xmath8 , where @xmath45 . \n this result generalizes the formula @xmath270 for the number of ordinary de  bruijn sequences  . \n here we use an ordinary word form ; if counting the sequences in a circular form , then the number is to be divided by @xmath271 . \n we provided two algorithms for generating a @xmath2-shift de  bruijn sequence of order @xmath1 . \n the first algorithm is to rearrange factors from two simpler multi - shift de  bruijn sequences , where the order is a multiple of the shift . \n the second is the analogue of the `` prefer one '' algorithm ( for example , see  ) for generating ordinary de  bruijn sequence . \n the multi - shift de  bruijn sequence has application in the frobenius problem in a free monoid by providing constructions of examples \n . it will be interesting to see that this generalized concept of the de  bruijn sequence can help in other fields of theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics .",

lying spectrum in ( p , t ) reactions@xcite , is still without any conclusive experimental confirmation . for a discussion , in particluar in connection with two - particle transfer reactions , on many aspects of pairing correlations in nuclei \n we refer to a recent review@xcite . \n we have studied the problem of collective pairing modes at high excitation energy in two neutron transfer reactions with the aim to prove the advantage of using unstable beam as a new tool to enhance the excitation of such modes @xcite . \n the main point is that with standard available beams one is faced with a large energy mismatch that strongly hinders the excitation of high - lying states and favours the transition to the ground state of the final system . \n instead the optimum q - value condition in the ( @xmath3he,@xmath4he ) stripping reaction suppresses the ground state and should allow the transition to 10 - 15 mev energy region . \n we have performed particle - particle rpa calculations on lead and bcs+rpa on tin , as paradigmatic examples of normal and superfluid systems , evaluating the response to the pairing operator . \n subsequently the two - neutron transfer form factors have been constructed in the framework of the macroscopic model@xcite and used in dwba computer codes . \n we have estimated cross - sections of the order of some millibarns , dominating over the mismatched transition to the ground state . \n recently we added similar calculations on other much studied targets to give some guide for experimental work . \n the formal analogy between particle - hole and particle - particle excitations is very well established both from the theoretical side@xcite and from the experimental side for what concern low - lying pairing vibrations around closed shell nuclei and pairing rotations in open shells . \n the predicted concentration of strength of a @xmath5 character in the high -

rpa equations ( that may be found in the already cited work by the author ) we merely state that the pairing phonon may be expressed as a superposition of 2p ( or 2h ) states with proper forward and backward amplitudes ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) . \n the pair transfer strength , that is a measure of the amount of collectivity of a each state @xmath13 , is given by : @xmath14 . \n \\label{p5}\\ ] ] this quantity is plotted in the first column of fig . \n ( [ fig2 ] ) for the removal ( upper panel ) and addition mode ( lower panel ) . in the same figure \n are reported the pairing strength parameters for the states of @xmath1sn . to obtain these last quantities for superfluid spherical \n nuclei one has to rewrite the hamiltonian according to the bcs transformation and has to solve more complex rpa equations . in this case \n the pairing strength for the addition of two particles is given , for each state @xmath13 , by : @xmath15_{00}|0\\rangle =   \\sum_{j } \\sqrt{2j+1 } [ u^{2}_{j } x_{n}(j ) + v^{2}_{j}y_{n}(j)]\\ ] ] where the @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the usual occupation probabilities . \n the amount of collectivity is a clear signal of the structural existence of giant pairing vibrations in the high - lying energy region . \n we also report here a number of analogous results for other commonly studied targets    = 9.4pc    = 9.4pc    = 9.4pc    with the aim of giving some indications to experimentalists on the reasons why we think that lead and tin are some of the most promising candidates . \n we have studied two isotopes of calcium with closed shells . \n even if the absolute magnitudes of the @xmath18 is lower , it is worthwhile to notice that some enhancement is seen in the more neutron - rich @xmath19ca with respect to @xmath20ca . \n an important role in this change is certainly due to the different shell structure of the two nuclei as well as to the scheme that we implemented to obtain the set of single particle levels . \n the latter is responsible for the collectivity of the removal modes in both ca isotopes and also for the difficulty in finding out a collective state in the addition modes . \n we display also results for @xmath21zr where the strength is much more fragmented and the identification of the gpv is more difficult . in the work of broglia and bes estimates for the energy of the pairing resonance are given as @xmath22 mev and @xmath23 mev for normal and superfluid systems respectively . \n our figures follow roughly these prescriptions based on simple arguments ( and much more grounded in the case of normal nuclei ) as evident from table [ ta1 ] . \n .comparison of position of gpv between our calculation and the broglia and bes estimate . \n [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 13.8pc    = 13.8pc    these cross - sections have been derived for sharp states , and we refer to the numbers in the last table when speaking of order of magnitude estimates . obviously cross - section in the high - lying energy region have a finite ( and large ) width that should be inserted for a more realistic description of the spectrum . \n we have chosen a simple scheme that gives a lorentzian distribution with a width that grows quadratically with the excitation energy , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 adjusted to give a width of 4 mev for the gpv . \n this could seem rather arbitrary since there is no reason for an _ a priori _ assignment of this quantity . \n we have been brought to this simple prescription because other collective states ( of different nature ) lying in the same energy region display similar values for their width , and it is reasonable to assume some rule to narrow the low - energy states and to broaden the high - energy ones . \n the final achievements for the four reactions studied in detail are presented in figure [ fig4 ] where the areas corresponding to the cross - sections given above have been shaded to give a feeling of the relative magnitudes of the transition to the ground states and to the gpv s . it is worthwhile to note that in the case of pb there is a considerable gain in using unstable beams , while in sn is much less evident . \n one sees the need for unstable helium when compares the magnitude for the pairing resonance in the right a ) and b ) panels with the peak at zero energy : in the first panel the transition to the ground state is extremely hindered . \n a @xmath3he beam is currently available ( or it will be available in the very near future ) in many radioactive ion beams facilities around the world and the calculations that we have presented could allow a planning for future experiments aimed to study the not yet completely unraveled role of pairing interaction in common nuclei , using exotic weakly bound nuclei as useful tools . \n the author wishes to gratefully acknowledge discussions with andrea vitturi , hugo sofia and wolfram von oertzen on various aspects of theoretical and experimental nuclear physics . \n the participation at the _ vii international school -

        "abstract": "The study explores giant pairing vibrations (GPVs) in nuclei, focusing on their detection using two-particle transfer reactions with neutron-rich, weakly-bound projectiles. Calculations on lead and tin nuclei reveal pairing strength distributions for particle addition and removal. The research suggests that using weakly-bound beams enhances transitions to high-energy states, achieving cross-sections around a millibarn, which surpass ground state transitions. These findings provide experimental insights for identifying GPVs and understanding pairing interactions in nuclear systems."

        "article": "the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) will rank as one of the major scientific achievements of this century . \n their detection will open up a new observational window to the universe , revealing dynamic sources of strong field relativistic gravity previously inaccessible through conventional astronomical instruments . \n our understanding of space - time and matter under the most extreme conditions will be transformed . \n although there has been no direct detection of gws to date , indirect evidence for their existence comes from high precision , nobel - prize winning measurements of the pulsar psr 1913 + 16 and its companion neutron star ( ns ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the gw emission that drives the system s orbital decay is in agreement with the predictions of general relativity to better than 1% @xcite . \n when such binary neutron star ( bns ) systems eventually coalesce , they are predicted to emit copious amounts of gws @xcite . \n these sources will be prime targets for the new generation of gw detectors , led by advanced ligo ( aligo ; * ? ? ? * ) which is set to begin observing during the second half of 2015 and advanced virgo a year later @xcite . at final sensitivity \n , these advanced detectors are expected to detect bns mergers at a rate within the range 0.4400 yr@xmath0 @xcite . \n compact binary coalescences ( cbcs ) consisting of at least one black hole ( bh ) are also targets for gw detectors ; although there is compelling evidence for their existence @xcite , the event rates of these sources for aligo detection is not well known . \n one realisation in the last decade is that coalescing systems of ns / ns or ns / bh events could be the progenitors of short - hard gamma ray bursts ( sgrbs ) ; transient events routinely observed throughout the electromagnetic ( em ) spectrum @xcite . \n there exist other types of em , neutrino and cosmic ray emissions that may also be associated with gw events . \n these include long - duration gamma ray bursts ( lgrbs ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , short gamma ray repeaters @xcite , supernovae @xcite , fast radio bursts @xcite as well as others . \n history has already shown that multi - wavelength astronomy can play an important role in unveiling new phenomena . in the last decade , x - ray , optical and radio follow - ups have all transformed and revealed new processes in our understanding of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) ; combining em observations with those in the gw domain will too provide new insight into the internal engines and mechanisms at play in a multitude of different sources . \n a new generation of sensitive , wide - field telescopes , advancements in time domain astronomy and upgrades to neutrino and cosmic ray detectors can provide a coordinated network for discovery . \n the possible simultaneous detection of photons , neutrinos or high energy particles with gws would be a landmark moment for astrophysics , initiating a new era of _ _ multi - messenger _ \n _ astronomy , for the first time including gw .    maximising \n the potential offered by gw observations involves the development of a worldwide , multi - messenger network . \n australian facilities are ideally placed to foster scientific exchanges in this new era and agreements have already been established . to conduct em follow - up of gw triggers , memorandums of understanding ( mous ) have been signed between the ligo / virgo gw collaboration and a number of facilities either based in australia or with strong australian involvement ; these include : the anglo - australian telescope , the australian square kilometer array pathfinder ( askap ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , icecube @xcite , the murchison widefield array ( mwa ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , and the skymapper @xcite , the gw optical transient observer ( goto ) and zadko @xcite optical telescopes . \n in this paper , we focus on the most probable multi - messenger observations from the advanced detector era ; those associated with grbs . \n whilst doing so , we consider the contribution that the australian facilities can make to the worldwide multi - messenger effort . \n the structure of this paper is as follows : section 2 describes gw astronomy . \n sections 3 and 4 introduce sgrbs and lgrbs and describe how co - ordinated gw and multiwavelength observations of these events can provide breakthrough science . \n section 5 acts as a primer for those unfamiliar with the concepts and terminologies of detection and data analysis often used in the gw domain ; this section is not designed to be exhaustive but to present some of the most important concepts in gw detection and data analysis . \n section 6 discusses the expected rates and detection ranges for gw sources . \n the next two sections describe two of the strategies that form the basis for coordinated gw and em observations in the gw era . \n section 7 discusses em triggered gw searches ; these could likely yield the first coincident gw - em event through archival gw data . \n section 8 discusses the em follow - up of gw triggers ; this strategy is highly challenging due to the large positional uncertainties of gw observations but the potential rewards for success are without doubt highly significant . \n section 10 discusses the australian facilities involved in the co - ordinated science programs with aligo / adv and we highlight the areas in which they could contribute in this new frontier . \n finally , in section 11 we discuss the role neutrino follow - up plays in gw detection . \n gravitational waves are produced by regions of space - time that are distorted by high velocity bulk motions of matter . \n the timescale of the motions determine the frequency of the gw emission ; ground based detectors will target systems with masses in the range 110@xmath1 @xmath2 , which emit in the 1  hz10  khz band . \n this frequency range , covering the audio band , has motivated the characterisation of interferometric gw astronomy as `` listening to the universe '' . \n instruments capable of achieving detections will begin observations in the second half of 2015 . \n advanced ligo , a pair of us based interferometric detectors at hanford and livingston ( usa * ? ? ? \n * ) will have its first observational science run ( o1 ) in late-2015 ; a year later it will be joined by the italian advanced virgo ( adv ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) for a second observing run ( o2 ) . \n the `` advanced '' network of interferometric gw detectors will eventually have 10 times the sensitivity of the first generation instruments . \n the increased sensitivity translates into a factor @xmath3 increase in observed volume , making detections expected rather than plausible . \n additional instruments are expected to eventually join the network . \n kagra , a japanese detector , is envisioned to begin operation in 2018 - 19 @xcite and ligo - india is expected to be operational from 2020 , reaching a design sensitivity at the same level as aligo by around 2022  @xcite . \n the gw observations made by these instruments will differ from most conventional em observations in several ways :    1 . \n gws are not scattered or obscured by intervening material like dust so provide a window into the densest regions of the universe . \n as gw detectors observe an amplitude rather than a flux , the measure of detectability follows an inverse relationship with distance rather than the conventional inverse square law . \n therefore , number counts of a homogeneous distribution of standard - candle sources increases with distance , @xmath4 , as , @xmath5 , rather than , @xmath6 ; 3 .   as gws couple weakly to the detectors , \n even very local astronomical sources of gws have to be highly energetic emitters of gravitational radiation ; 4 . \n gw detectors are nearly omnidirectional , with a nearly @xmath7 steradian sensitivity to astrophysical events with a greater than average response over more than 40% of the sky . \n the first point implies that gw observations can allow us to view astrophysical phenomena inaccessible by other means . \n the gravitational window can therefore enable frontier explorations in the low to intermediate redshift universe ( @xmath8 ) of sources that are electromagnetically invisible for much , or all , of their lives . \n the second point means that a factor 2 improvement in the sensitivity of a gw detector results in a factor 8 increase in the volume of the universe being probed . \n the third point emphasises a detection bias for detecting the most highly energetic astrophysical events . \n the typical fluxes of gw sources are of order @xmath9 jy , far greater than equivalent fluxes typically observed in the radio domain ( @xmath10jy  jy ) . \n the final point means that gw detectors are naturally survey instruments over a wide band of frequencies ( 105000 hz ) . \n there are a number of types of em counterparts that may be associated with gw emissions @xcite . \n as some of these counterparts are quite speculative , this paper focuses on gw signals associated with grbs . \n other sources of simultaneous em and gw emission include supernovae as well as multiple emission mechanisms from nss ; for a review of the latter , see the accompanying article in this series @xcite .    in the next few sections we provide a summary of both sgrbs and lgrbs and the type of gw / em associations that could be targeted in the gw era . \n some of these predictions are based on solid foundations whilst some are more speculative . in considering the latter \n , we note that when a new window of observation has been opened in the past , the discoveries that transform our understanding of the universe have often been the least expected . \n +    gravitational waves from the merger of coalescing binary systems of ns / ns and ns / bhs are confidently predicted to have observable em counterparts . \n this expectation is a result of the connection between these events and sgrbs ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the evidence stems from a number of different channels . \n firstly , the dynamic timescales of discs predicted from the merger of cbcs are consistent with the durations of sgrbs . \n secondly , em follow - ups of sgrbs have never provided an associated supernova . \n thirdly , sgrb afterglows have been localised to galaxies harbouring older stellar populations with offsets of order tens of kpc from their galactic centers ; this is consistent with post - natal kick velocities of 100s of km s@xmath0 , and also with the fainter and shorter lived afterglows expected from an ambient interstellar medium at a large offset . \n finally , as is discussed in  [ kilonova ] , the discovery of a faint em transient called a _ \n kilonova _ has provided the strongest observational evidence to date of the sgrb / cbc association . \n conclusive proof of the cbc / sgrb association will be provided through gw observations . \n coincident em and gw observations of sgrbs could also provide a fascinating insight to the dominant mechanisms at the heart of grbs . \n low - latency gw pipelines could enable multi - wavelength follow - up measurements of the prompt emission , constraining both the underlying central engines and the emission mechanisms at work . \n later - time multi - wavelength follow - ups can provide insight through extensive coverage of the sgrb afterglow . \n a number of em counterparts have been predicted to accompany the inspiral and merger of ns / ns and ns / bh systems . in figure [ fig_mm_scenarios ] \n we show the likely outcomes of these mergers and in the following sections we will briefly review the most likely em counterparts that could accompany cbcs .      during the final stages of the merger of a compact binary , \n the system is expected to launch a highly relativistic jet that interacts with itself and the surrounding medium ( the fireball model for grbs ; e.g. * ? ? ? \n collisions of material moving at different velocities within the jet will lead to internal shocks , giving short - lived bursts of gamma - rays that we detect as the sgrb prompt emission . as the accretion timescale is expected to be @xmath112 seconds @xcite , \n the grbs associated with compact binary mergers are typically shorter in duration than those associated with core - collapse supernovae ( explaining the observed distribution of grbs ; * ? ? ? \n . however , the division between these two populations is not easily identifiable from the prompt gamma - ray emission alone ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) .    a number of _ \n fermi_-lat grbs have shown @xmath12gev emission ( even at redshifts as distant as @xmath13 ) . \n two bursts were observed with gamma - ray photons reaching energies up to 94gev ( grb 130427a ) and 62gev ( grb 131231a )  this supports the suggestion that the photon energies may extend higher than previously assumed @xcite . \n significantly , these discoveries have not been limited to lgrbs , with sgrbs also showing high energy photons and gev emission often continuing for 10 s of seconds beyond the initial burst . the fact that _ \n fermi_-lat discovered a photon of energy 31gev during the prompt phase of grb 090510 @xcite is promising for co - ordinated observations between gw detectors and ground - based cherenkov telescope arrays @xcite operating at @xmath12 10 gev . \n additionally , sgrbs with time - extended emission have recently been cited as promising targets for cherenkov telescope arrays @xcite . \n one exciting possibility is the observation of prompt optical flashes . \n so far , these emissions have only been observed in lgrbs @xcite . an early optical emission correlated with the prompt gamma - rays could indicate a common origin related to the internal shocks @xcite . \n a number of studies have suggested that compact binary mergers could generate prompt coherent radio emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n such mechanisms include excitation of the plasma surrounding a compact binary merger by gws @xcite , from a dynamically - generated magnetic field after the merger @xcite , or from the onset of the collision of the forward shock with the surrounding medium @xcite . however , the detectability of emission from these processes will be dependent upon the scattering by the surrounding environment @xcite . \n nonetheless , these studies suggest compact binary mergers are an interesting contender for the progenitors of fast radio bursts ( frbs ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , which are currently unknown . \n plateaus and flares in x - ray light curves following grbs are signatures of ongoing energy injection . \n this could be caused by late - time accretion onto a central black hole ( unlikely in the compact binary scenario ; see discussion in * ? ? ? \n * ) , or from ongoing energy injection from the spindown of a newly born neutron star . \n indeed , recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) have shown that the merger of two nss could result in a supramassive ns ; a star with a mass greater than the non - rotating maximum mass but supported from further collapse through rotation @xcite . \n around 60% of x - ray afterglow light curves of sgrbs observed by the _ swift _ \n satellite @xcite have shown plateaus lasting 10010000  s after the burst ; these have been attributed to electromagnetic spin - down emissions from protomagnetars @xcite formed via the merger of two neutron stars @xcite . \n observations of the plateau phase can also be used to constrain the ns equation of state , with gw observations of the inspiral phase significantly aiding this endeavour @xcite    if the post - merger remnant is an ns , early optical afterglow as bright as 17th magnitude in r band ( assuming a distance of @xmath14 mpc ; see  [ section_cbc_ranges ] ) could be produced from dissipation of a wide - beamed protomagnetar wind @xcite . \n this magnetar wind could launch ejecta at relativistic speeds which would interact with the surrounding medium and produce a bright broadband afterglow from synchrotron radiation @xcite . \n gravitational wave emission may also accompany an afterglow plateau if a millisecond magnetar is born from the collision . \n multiple mechanisms for generating such gws exist in nascent neutron stars , including secular bar modes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) , @xmath15-modes @xcite , and magnetic - field induced stellar deformations @xcite . \n such emission could be observable by aligo out to @xmath16 mpc @xcite . \n in fact , the x - ray light curve itself can be used to constrain the total gw emission from these systems @xcite . \n some plateaus following sgrbs exhibit an extremely steep decay phase , commonly interpreted as the collapse of the nascent neutron star to a black hole @xcite . \n such collapse could potentially produce an frb when the magnetic field lines snap as they cross the bh horizon @xcite , which is expected to occur @xmath17 s after the merger @xcite . \n a low latency gw trigger could enable prompt follow - ups to test this connection @xcite .      as the relativistic jet propagates \n , it collides with the medium surrounding the progenitor resulting in a forward shock travelling into the surrounding medium , and a reverse shock propagating back up the jet ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n these shock fronts produce multi - wavelength synchrotron emission , initially peaking in the x - ray and moving through the different wavelengths to radio as it fades . \n the typical afterglow of grbs is attributed to the forward shock emission and the brightness of this afterglow is dependent upon a number of parameters , including the density of the surrounding medium . \n therefore , in a low density environment , the forward shock component is expected to be relatively faint . \n the multi - wavelength afterglows of sgrbs have been observed and are typically fainter than those of lgrbs @xcite . \n this is consistent with sgrbs being less energetic than lgrbs and with their locations in lower density environments . \n the reverse shock has also been observed for sgrb 051221a ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . \n a ` kilonova ' is been predicted to form after the merger of two nss . \n this faint optical transient is powered by the radioactive decay of the ejected neutron rich matter @xcite and could reach around 21-23 mag in the optical and 21-24 mag in the nir for a source at 200 mpc @xcite . \n recent optical and near - infrared follow - up observations of grb 130603b have provided the most conclusive evidence to date of this scenario , reinforcing the theory that compact object mergers are the progenitors of sgrbs @xcite . \n these observations have added significantly to other observational evidence in support of this scenario @xcite . \n coincident em and gw observations could confirm that sgrbs are indeed the result of coalescing compact binaries . \n an additional prompt em emission related to the kilonova mechanism has also recently been suggested by @xcite . \n this has been inspired by studies that suggest a small fraction of the ejected neutron rich matter can expand rapidly enough to avoid r - process capture @xcite . \n the suggestion is that @xmath18-decay from free neutrons in the outermost layers of this ejecta could power optical emission on a timescale of hours after the merger , peaking at around magnitude 22 in the u - band for a source . for a source at 200 mpc \n this signal would peak at around magnitude 22 in the u - band and would act as a precursor to a kilonova . \n lgrbs are amongst the most luminous transient events in the universe in terms of em radiation per unit solid angle . \n these beamed emissions have been observed to last up to @xmath19 s @xcite and can radiate a total energy equivalent to that of the sun in its entire 10 gyr lifetime . \n the extreme luminosities allow lgrbs to be seen out to cosmological volumes , making them a probe of the high redshift universe ( @xmath20 ) . \n the favoured scenario for these bursts is described by the collapsar model @xcite in which the inner part of a wolf - rayet star progenitor collapses to form a rapidly rotating black hole . \n high angular momentum enables the infalling matter to form an accretion disk , which in turn provides the energy reservoir to power an ultra - relativistic jet that blasts its way through the stellar envelope . \n the observed radiation is explained through synchrotron and/or inverse compton emission from the accelerated electrons in internal and external shocks . \n some authors have suggested instead that the central engines may consist of magnetars @xcite . \n there is observational evidence to support this scenario for at least a proportion of lgrbs @xcite . \n the connection between lgrbs with the collapse of massive stars @xcite has been supported by afterglow observations in or near dense regions of active star - formation ; predominantly dwarf starburst field galaxies @xcite . as mentioned earlier \n , their denser environments , as well as their higher emission energies , mean that the multiwavelength afterglows of lgrbs are typically brighter than those that occur from sgrbs @xcite .    in terms of gw emissions from these events \n , a number of lgrbs have been associated with core - collapse supernova @xcite . modelling \n the gw emission from these supernovae is very complex , requiring a combination of general relativistic hydrodynamics , magnetic fields , rotation , neutrino transport and nuclear physics @xcite . \n simulations have so far provided a picture of a very complex and chaotic behavior that includes shock formation and turbulence that create highly complex waveforms with multiple sharp bursts over ms durations . however , most scenarios suggest an event may have to be within tens of kpc for detection . as most lgrbs occur at cosmological distances , the vast majority of their gw signals will be out of reach for advanced detectors .    the requirement for rapid rotation to produce the disc in a grb @xcite allows for alternative emission mechanisms that could produce detectable gws out to 10s of mpc @xcite . \n fragmentation instabilities could be produced in the core or in the disc @xcite . \n rapid rotation could also give rise to rotational instabilities in the protoneutron star remnant @xcite    a number of studies have suggested there exists a sub - population of lgrbs known as low - luminosity grbs ( _ _ ll__grbs ) . \n these events have isotropic equivalent gamma - ray luminosities 2 - 3 orders of magnitude below classical lgrbs @xcite and have only been detected at low-@xmath21 due to their lower energy emissions ( the closest was grb980425 at z = 0.0085 or 36mpc ) . \n as such their rates have been predicted to be 23 orders of magnitude greater than lgrbs . \n observations have confirmed that both lgrbs and _ _ ll__grbs produce supernovae , suggesting that the _ _ ll__grbs may just be lower - energy events from the tail of the distribution . \n this has been a long going debate and attempts to address it have used statistical arguments @xcite , fits to the peak flux distribution @xcite , and simulation @xcite . the suggestion that _ _ \n ll__grbs could be just normal lgrbs viewed off - axis was discounted based on statistical arguments , as it would produce a far higher local rate density than expected from lgrbs and would require narrower opening angles for lgrbs than determined from the breaks in afterglow lightcurves @xcite .    recently , an analysis of _ _ ll__grb 060218 has suggested that the main difference in the two bursts arises from an extended low - mass envelope in _ _ \n the existence of such an envelope can smother the jet and drive a mildly relativistic shock resulting in a much lower luminosity than that produced by an ultra - relativistic jet that is able to penetrate through the bare progenitor star . \n interestingly , the statistical arguments suggesting separate populations put forward by @xcite can also support these two different scenarios . \n it is therefore possible that gw emission mechanisms could be driven by the same type of engine for both these classes . \n the output from a single gw detector consists of a time series data stream , @xmath22 , composed of the detector response to a gw signal , @xmath23 , and the detector noise @xmath24 : @xmath25 in general , @xmath23 will be a linear combination of the two orthogonal transverse polarizations , @xmath26 , weighted by the dimensionless detector antenna pattern functions for the two polarizations @xmath27 : @xmath28 which describe the detector sensitivity to radiation of different polarizations , incident from different directions @xcite . \n the angles , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , represent the direction to the source and @xmath31 is the polarization angle of the wave . \n a gw detector can follow the phase of a gw signal , so the time series is generally represented in the frequency domain by the strain amplitude spectral density , @xmath32 . \n this quantity is defined through the power spectral density @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the fourier transform of the time series . \n similarly , one can define a signal power spectral density , @xmath35 , and a noise power spectral density , @xmath36 . \n the strain amplitude spectral density is given by : @xmath37 with dimensions of @xmath38 @xcite . \n this quantity is often used in plots to display the sensitivity of gw interferometers . \n a single gw detector can not determine the polarization state or source direction of a transient signal . \n to obtain source localization , a widely separated network of gw detectors is essential . \n such a network may employ techniques such as _ coincidence analysis _ , in which individual events from different detectors are correlated in time @xcite , or _ coherent analysis _ , in which synchronized detector outputs are merged before searching for a common pattern @xcite . by effectively resolving the different times of arrival of gw events between members of a network , \n coherent network analysis enables a detector array to become an all - sky monitor with good angular resolution over all source directions .    achieving good directional sensitivity \n is of paramount importance for gw / em associations . for the sources considered in this review , directional sensitivity is determined through triangulation of arrival times . to maximize the time delays , and hence improve directionality , \n it is advantageous that a network be as geographically widely separated as possible @xcite and as such , a number of detectors are planned to join the aligo / adv network throughout the next decade . \n the japanese observatory kagra , should begin operations by around 2018 - 19 @xcite ; at design sensitivity this detector could improve the directional precision of a aligo / adv network by a factor of 1.5 - 2 and the detection rate by a similar factor @xcite . \n ligo - india operating at aligo sensitivity will be added to the aligo / adv network by 2022  by then bnss will be detectable out to @xmath39200 mpc and up to 400 events are possible per year @xcite . \n an indian detector will improve the angular resolution sufficiently to increase the percentage of gw sources detected within 5 deg@xmath40 from 3 - 7% to 17% @xcite . \n it has long been recognized that a gw detector in australia would add the longest baseline to the proposed advanced detector network ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n for example , adding an australian detector to an aligo / adv three detector network can reduce the error in solid angle to tens of arc - minutes for high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) signals @xcite , dramatically improving the ability to localise gw sources for multi - wavelength follow - up observations . \n this scenario could be realised when third generation observatories such as the ` einstein gravitational wave telescope ' ( et ) become a reality in the next decade @xcite . \n the optimal site for a detector in the southern hemisphere been shown to be western australia @xcite , the current home to an 80-m baseline prototype gw detector . \n the false alarm rate ( far ) is the rate that false positives appear above a given snr threshold , and is dependent on the number of glitches ( non - stationary transients ) in the gw data stream . \n it is a critical measure as it determines whether a candidate should be considered for follow - up . for well modeled sources , \n the background of false alarms is at a level close to that of gaussian noise . for un - modeled sources \n typically short duration transients  the data quality has a greater effect on detection confidence . one therefore sets the threshold high enough so that noise generated false alarms are negligible . \n given that the probability , @xmath41 , of observing an event with an amplitude in the range @xmath42 to @xmath43 is given by a gaussian distribution of standard deviation @xmath44 , the probability of obtaining a far greater than a given threshold , @xmath45 , is : @xmath46    to be 99% confident that a gw has been detected , one can set an snr @xmath47 which is equivalent to a far of 1 in 100 years of observation . to see this \n one can approximate number of noise instances during that period . \n if the detector output sampling rate is 1 khz and the output is processed through @xmath48 filters , in 100 years we get @xmath49 , yielding @xmath50 which is our required snr . for a network of three equivalent detectors combined snr , \n @xmath51 is given as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 represents the snr in the ith detector @xcite . \n this shows that for a network of 3 equivalent detectors , to dismiss false alarms at a level @xmath54hz requires @xmath55 .     + \n the expected gw signals from cbcs takes on the well modelled chirp form shown in figure [ fig_chirp ] . \n the figure shows how the signal increases in both amplitude and frequency towards merger ; as it does so it sweeps across the sensitive bandwidth of advanced gw interferometric detectors .    for such well - modeled signals , the most efficient signal detection method to extract signals from noisy detector data \n is _ matched filtering _ , in which a _ template _ , representing the predicted waveform as a function of time is correlated with the output of a detector @xcite . \n a matched signal will produce an output much greater than that expected for pure noise with an optimal snr given as : @xmath56^{1/2}. \\label{eq : snr}\\ ] ] for well - modelled sources , matched filtering enhances the value of the signal by a factor @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the number of cycles used in the integration . as inspiralling systems approach merger , even though the rest frame gw amplitude will increase , the number of cycles in each frequency bin , @xmath59 , gets smaller ; therefore the detected signal will decrease . \n this means that for inspiraling systems , rather than solely base the predicted amplitude of the radiation as a true indicator of the detectability , we include a measure of the observed cycles . \n the value of @xmath58 increases with the compactness of the system as it approaches merger and if observed from a frequency of 10 hz until merger , could produce @xmath60 cycles  effectively improving the detectability by a factor of 100 . \n however , to achieve such gains , a gw data - stream would have to be filtered by a large number of templates ( of order @xmath61 in near real time \n the significant challenges in both theoretical modeling and computational efficiency to achieve this can not be underestimated . \n one important aspect of well - modeled inspiralling systems is that a detection can be made 10s of seconds before the merger if enough cycles can be detected to boost the snr @xcite . \n figure 2 illustrates this concept showing a chirp signal 40s before the merger phase . \n this scenario could allow a low - latency alert to be sent out to em facilities as near real - time as possible to catch a prompt em signature ; the combination of em and gw data in this regime would provide valuable insight into the inner workings of such cataclysmic events . \n it is also worth noting that gws can provide an independent measure of luminosity distance , @xmath62 @xcite . during the inspiral phase , the gw strain , and the rate of change of gw frequency \n are given as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the redshifted chirp mass , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , @xmath67 are the component masses of the binary . \n therefore , if one can determine the redshift through , for example , a galaxy association , one can measure the redshift - luminosity distance relation independent of the cosmic distance ladder . \n a recent series of papers has reinvigorated this topic by introducing novel methods for breaking the redshift - chirp mass degeneracy with future gw observations @xcite . \n although matched filtering is the optimal strategy for gaussian , stationary noise , high amplitude transients due to instrumental and environmental artifacts can render gw data to be non - stationary and non - gaussian . therefore , one must employ robust methods that can reject instrumental artifacts and retain the true gw events . \n one such method is the @xmath68 veto that is a powerful consistency test used to reject false alarms @xcite . \n this method uses the fact that the quantity @xmath45 is an integral over all frequencies and therefore not sensitive to the contributions from different frequency regions of the broadband signal . \n one can split the signal spectrum into @xmath58 bins of equal snr contribution , and draw a comparison with the expected value in each bin ( based on the model template ) . \n a true gw event will have power accumulated approximately equally in each of @xmath58 bins ; a noise glitch will have power unevenly distributed and will yield a large @xmath68 value . \n , b.  l. , abbott , t.  m.  c. , angstadt , r. , et  al . \n 2012 , in society of photo -

        "article": "the physical content of general relativity is contained in einstein s equation , which has a well - posed initial value formulation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in principle , therefore , to determine the motion of bodies in general relativity  such as binary neutron stars or black holes \n one simply needs to provide appropriate initial data ( satisfying the constraint equations ) on a spacelike slice and then evolve this data via einstein s equation . \n however , in practice , it is generally impossible to find exact solutions of physical interest describing the motion of bodies by analytic methods . \n although it now is possible to find solutions numerically in many cases of interest , it is difficult and cumbersome to do so , and one may overlook subtle effects and/or remain unenlightened about some basic general features of the solutions . therefore , it is of considerable interest to develop methods that yield approximate descriptions of motion in some cases of interest . \n in general , the motion of a body of finite size will depend on the details of its composition as well as the details of its internal states of motion . \n therefore , one can expect to get a simple description of motion only in some kind of `` point particle limit '' . \n however , einstein s equation is nonlinear , and a straightforward analysis @xcite shows that it does not make any mathematical sense to consider solutions of einstein s equation with a distributional stress - energy tensor supported on a worldline . \n physically , if one tried to shrink a body down to zero radius at fixed mass , collapse to a black hole would occur before the point particle limit could be reached . \n distributional stress - energy tensors supported on a world - line _ do _ make mathematical sense in the context of the linearized einstein equation . \n therefore , one might begin a treatment of gravitational self - force by considering a metric perturbation , @xmath3 , in a background metric , @xmath4 , sourced by the stress - energy tensor of a `` point particle '' of mass m , given in coordinates @xmath5 by @xmath6(t , x^i ) = 8 \\pi m u_a(t ) u_b(t ) \\frac{\\delta^{(3)}(x^i    - z^i(t))}{\\sqrt{-g } } \\frac{d\\tau}{dt}\\,\\ , .\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the unit tangent ( i.e. , 4-velocity ) of the worldline @xmath8 defined by @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the proper time along @xmath8 . \n ( here @xmath11 is the `` coordinate delta function '' , i.e. , @xmath12 . the right side also could be written covariantly as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the covariant 4-dimensional delta - function and @xmath10 denotes the proper time along @xmath8 . ) \n however , this approach presents two major difficulties . \n first , the linearized bianchi identity implies that the point particle stress - energy must be conserved . \n however , as we shall see explicitly in section [ sec : geodesic ] below , this requires that the worldline @xmath8 of the particle be a geodesic of the background spacetime \n . therefore , there are no solutions to equation for non - geodesic source curves , making it hopeless to use this equation to derive corrections to geodesic motion . \n this difficulty has been circumvented in @xcite and other references by modifying as follows . \n choose the lorenz gauge condition , so that equation takes the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 with @xmath17 . \n equation by itself has solutions for any source curve @xmath8 ; it is only when the lorenz gauge condition is adjoined that the equations are equivalent to the linearized einstein equation and geodesic motion is enforced . \n therefore , if one solves the lorenz - gauge form of the linearized einstein equation while simply _ ignoring _ the lorenz gauge condition ) truly is ignored in the sense that it is not even pointed out that one has modified the linearized einstein equation , and no attempt is made to justify this modification . ] that was used to derive , one allows for the possibility non - geodesic motion . \n of course , this `` gauge relaxation '' of the linearized einstein equation produces an equation inequivalent to the original . \n however , because deviations from geodesic motion are expected to be small , the lorenz gauge violation should likewise be small , and it thus has been argued @xcite that solutions to the two systems should agree to sufficient accuracy . \n the second difficulty is that the solutions to eq . \n ( [ eq : wave ] ) are singular on the worldine of the particle . therefore , \n naive attempts to compute corrections to the motion due to @xmath3such as demanding that the particle move on a geodesic of @xmath18are virtually certain to encounter severe mathematical difficulties , analogous to the difficulties encountered in treatments of the electromagnetic self - force problem .    despite these difficulties \n , there is a general consensus that in the approximation that spin and higher multipole moments may be neglected , the motion of a sufficiently small body ( with no `` incoming radiation '' ) should be described by self consistently solving eq . \n ( [ eq : wave ] ) via the retarded solution together with @xmath19 where @xmath20 with @xmath21 the retarded green s function for eq . \n ( [ eq : wave ] ) , normalized with a factor of @xmath22 , following @xcite . \n the symbol @xmath23 indicates that the range of the integral extends just short of the retarded time @xmath24 , so that only the `` tail '' ( i.e. , interior of the light cone ) portion of the green s function is used ( see , e.g. , reference @xcite for details ) . \n equations ( [ eq : wave ] ) and ( [ eq : misataquwa - intro ] ) are known as the misataquwa equations , and have been derived by a variety of approaches . however , there are difficulties with all of these approaches . \n one approach @xcite that has been taken is to parallel the analysis of @xcite in the electromagnetic case and use conservation of effective gravitational stress - energy to determine the motion . \n however , this use of distributional sources at second - order in perturbation theory results in infinities that must be `` regularized '' . \n although these regularization procedures are relatively natural - looking , the mathematical status of such a derivation is unclear . \n another approach @xcite is to postulate certain properties that equations of gravitational self - force should satisfy . \n this yields a mathematically clean derivation of the self - force corrected equations of motion . \n however , as the authors of @xcite emphasized , the motion of bodies in general relativity is fully described by einstein s equation together with the field equations of the matter sources , so no additional postulates should be needed to obtain an equation of motion , beyond the `` small body '' assumption and other such approximations . \n the analysis given by @xcite shows that equation follows from certain plausible assumptions . however , their derivation is thus only a plausibility argument for equation . \n similar remarks apply to a later derivation by poisson @xcite that uses a green s function decomposition developed by detweiler and whiting @xcite .    a third approach , taken by mino , sasaki , and tanaka @xcite and later poisson @xcite  building on previous work of burke @xcite , death @xcite , kates @xcite , thorne and hartle @xcite , and others  involves the use of matched astymptotic expansions . \n here one assumes a metric form in the `` near zone''where the metric is assumed to be that of the body , with a small correction due to the background spacetime  and in the `` far zone''where the metric is assumed to be that of the background spacetime , with a small correction due to the body . \n one then assumes that there is an overlap region of the body where both metric forms apply , and matches the expressions . \n the equations of motion of the body then arise from the matching conditions . \n however , as we shall indicate below , in addition to the `` lorenz gauge relaxation '' , there are a number of assumptions and steps in these derivations that have not been adequately justified .    a more rigorous approach to deriving gravitational self - force \n is suggested by the work of geroch and jang @xcite and later geroch and ehlers @xcite on geodesic motion of small bodies ( see also @xcite ) . in @xcite , \n one considers a fixed spacetime background metric @xmath4 and considers a smooth one - parameter family of stress - energy smooth tensors @xmath25 that satisfy the dominant energy condition and have support on a world tube . as the parameter goes to zero , the world tube shrinks to a timelike curve . \n it is then proven that this timelike curve must be a geodesic . \n this result was generalized in @xcite to allow @xmath4 to also vary with @xmath2 so that einstein s equation is satisfied . within the framework of @xcite , it therefore should be possible to derive perturbative corrections to geodesic motion , including gravitational self - force . \n however , the conditions imposed in @xcite in effect require the mass of the body to go to zero faster than @xmath26 . consequently , in this approach , a self - force correction like to the motion of the body would arise at higher order than finite size effects and possibly other effects that would depend on the composition of the body . \n thus , while the work of @xcite provides a rigorous derivation of geodesic motion of a `` small body '' to lowest order , it is not a promising approach to derive gravitatational self - force corrections to geodesic motion .    in this paper \n , we shall take an approach similar in spirit to that of @xcite , but we will consider a different smooth , one - parameter family of metrics @xmath0 , wherein , in effect , we have a body ( or black hole ) present that scales to zero size in a self - similar manner , with both the size and the mass of the body being proportional to @xmath2 . in the limit as @xmath27 , the body ( or black hole ) shrinks down to a worldline , @xmath8 . as in @xcite and @xcite , we prove that @xmath8 must be a geodesic of the `` background spacetime '' @xmath28although our method of proving this differs significantly from @xcite and @xcite . to first order in @xmath2 , the correction to the motion \n is described by a vector field , @xmath29 , on @xmath8 , which gives the `` infinitesimal displacement '' to the new worldline . \n we will show that , for any such one parameter family @xmath0 , in the lorenz gauge @xmath30 satisfies @xmath31    here @xmath32 and @xmath33 are , respectively , the mass and spin of the body . \n the terms in parentheses on the right side of this equation correspond exactly to the gravitational self - force term in eq . ; the first term is the papapetrou spin - force @xcite ; the second term is simply the usual right hand side of the geodesic deviation equation . \n equation is `` universal '' in the sense that it holds for any one - parameter family satisfying our assumptions , so it holds equally well for a ( sufficiently small ) blob of ordinary matter or a ( sufficiently small ) black hole . \n our derivation of is closely related to the matched asymptotic expansions analyses . however , our derivation is a rigorous , perturbative result . \n in addition , we eliminate a number of ad hoc , unjustified , and/or unnecssary assumptions made in previous approaches , including assumptions about the form of the `` body metric '' and its perturbations , assumptions about rate of change of these quantities with time , the imposition of certain gauge conditions , the imposition of boundary conditions at the body , and , most importantly , the step of lorenz gauge relaxation . furthermore , in our approach , the notion of a `` point particle '' is a concept that is _ derived _ rather than assumed . \n it also will be manifest in our approach that the results hold for all bodies ( or black holes ) and that the physical results do not depend on a choice of gauge ( although @xmath30 itself is a gauge dependent quantity , i.e. , the description of the corrections to particle motion depend on how the spacetimes at different @xmath2 are identified  see section [ sec : dipole ] and appendix a ) . \n in particular , because the lorenz gauge plays no preferred role in our derivation ( aside from being a computationally convenient choice ) , our gauge transformation law is not , as in previous work @xcite , restricted to gauges continuously related to the lorenz gauge . \n our approach also holds out the possibility of being extended so as to systematically take higher order corrections into account . \n however , we shall not attempt to undertake such an extension in this paper . \n although holds rigorously as a first - order perturbative correction to geodesic motion , this equation would not be expected to provide a good global - in - time approximation to motion , since the small local corrections to the motion given by may accumulate with time , and eq .   would not be expected to provide a good description of the perturbed motion when @xmath29 becomes large . \n we will argue in this paper that the misataquwa equations , eqs .   and , should provide a much better global - in - time approximation to motion than eq . \n , and they therefore should be used for self - consistent calculations of the motion of a small body , such as for calculations of extreme - mass - ratio inspiral . \n we note in passing that , in contrast to einstein s equation , maxwell s equations are linear , and it makes perfectly good mathematical sense to consider distributional solutions to maxwell s equations with point particle sources . \n however , if the charge - current sources are not specified in advance but rather are determined by solving the matter equations of motion  which are assumed to be such that the total stress - energy of the matter and electromagnetic field is conserved  then the full , coupled system of maxwell s equations together with the equations of motion of the sources becomes nonlinear in the the electromagnetic field . \n point particle sources do not make mathematical sense in this context either . \n it is for this reason that  despite more than a century of work on this problem  there is no mathematically legitimate derivation of the electromagnetic self - force on a charged particle . \n the methods of this paper can be used to rigorously derive a perturbative expression for electromagnetic self - force by considering suitable one - parameter families of coupled electromagnetic - matter systems , and we shall carry out this analysis elsewhere @xcite . however , we shall restrict consideration in this paper to the gravitational case . \n this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : \n example ] , we motivate the kind of one - parameter family of metrics , @xmath34 , that we will consider by examining the one - parameter family of schwarzschild - desitter spacetimes with black hole mass equal to @xmath2 . one way of taking the limit as @xmath35 yields desitter spacetime . \n we refer to this way of taking the limit as the `` ordinary limit '' . \n but we show that if we take the limit as @xmath35 in another way and also rescale the metric by @xmath36 , we obtain schwarzschild spacetime . \n we refer to this second way of taking the limit as @xmath35 as the `` scaled limit '' . \n the scaled limit can be taken at any time @xmath37 on the worldline @xmath8 . \n the simultaneous existence of both types of limits defines the kind of one parameter family of metrics we seek , wherein a body ( or black hole ) is shrinking down to a world - line @xmath8 in an asymptotically self - similar manner . \n the precise , general conditions we impose on @xmath0 are formulated in section [ sec : example ] . \n some basic properties of @xmath0 that follow directly from our assumptions are given in section [ sec : assumptions ] . \n in particular , we obtain general `` far zone '' and `` near zone '' expansions and we show that , at any @xmath37 , the scaled limit always yields a stationary , asymptotically flat spacetime at @xmath38 . in section [ sec : geodesic ] , we prove that @xmath8 must be a geodesic of the `` background spacetime '' ( i.e. , the spacetime at @xmath38 resulting from taking the ordinary limit ) . \n in other words , to zeroth order in @xmath2 a small body or black hole always moves on a geodesic . \n we also show that , to first order in @xmath2 , the metric perturbation associated with such a body or black hole corresponds to that of a structureless `` point particle '' . in section [ sec : dipole ] , we define the motion of the body ( or black hole ) to first order in @xmath2 by finding a coordinate displacement that makes the mass dipole moment of the stationary , asymptotically flat spacetime appearing in the scaled limit vanish . \n ( this can be interpreted as a displacement to the `` center of mass '' of the body . ) in section [ sec : calculation ] , we then derive eq . as the first order in @xmath2 correction to @xmath8 in the lorenz gauge . \n ( an appendix provides the transformation to other gauges . ) finally , in section [ sec : beyond ] we explain the status of the misataquwa equation . \n our spacetime conventions are those of wald @xcite , and we work in units where @xmath39 . \n lower case latin indices early in the alphabet ( @xmath40 ) will denote abstract spacetime indices ; greek indices will denote coordinate components of these tensors ; latin indices from mid - alphabet ( @xmath41 ) will denote spatial coordinate components . \n as discussed in the introduction , we seek a one - parameter family of metrics @xmath42 that describes a material body or black hole that `` shrinks down to zero size '' in an asymptotically self - similar manner . in order to motivate the general conditions on @xmath42 that we shall impose , we consider here an extremely simple example of the type of one - parameter family that we seek . \n this example will provide an illustration of the two types of limits that we shall use to characterize @xmath42 . \n our example is built from schwarzschild - desitter spacetime , @xmath43 ( this metric , of course , is a solution to the vacuum einstein s equation with a cosmological constant @xmath44 rather than a solution with @xmath45 , but the field equations will not play any role in the considerations of this section ; we prefer to use this example because of its simplicity and familiarity . ) the desired one - parameter family is @xmath46 where we consider only the portion of the spacetime with @xmath47 for some @xmath48 . for each @xmath2 \n , this spacetime describes the exterior gravitational field of a spherical body or black hole of mass @xmath49 in an asymptotically desitter spacetime . as @xmath35 , \n the body / black hole shrinks to zero size and mass . for @xmath38 , \n the spacetime is desitter spacetime , which extends smoothly to the worldline @xmath50 , corresponding to where the body / black hole was just before it `` disappeared '' . \n as explained clearly in @xcite , the limit of a one - parameter family of metrics @xmath42 depends on how the spacetime manifolds at different values of @xmath2 are identified . \n this identification of spacetime manifolds at different @xmath2 can be specified by choosing coordinates @xmath51 for each @xmath2 and identifying points labeled by the same value of the coordinates @xmath51 . \n if we use the coordinates @xmath52 in which the one - parameter family of metrics was presented to do the identification , then it is obvious that the limit as @xmath35 of @xmath42 is the desitter metric @xmath53 this corresponds to the view that the body / black hole shrinks to zero size and mass and `` disappears '' as @xmath35 . \n however , there is another way of taking the limit of @xmath42 as @xmath35 ; the existence of this second limit is one of the key ideas in this paper . \n choose an arbitrary time @xmath37 and , for @xmath54 , introduce new time and radial coordinates by @xmath55 and @xmath56 . \n in the new coordinates , the one - parameter family of metrics becomes @xmath57 we now consider the limit as @xmath35 by identifying the spacetimes with different @xmath2 at the same values of the barred coordinates . \n it is clear by inspection of eq.([gbar ] ) that the the limit of @xmath42 as @xmath35 at fixed @xmath58 exists , but is zero . \n in essence , the spacetime interval between any two events labeled by @xmath59 and @xmath60 goes to zero as @xmath35 because these events are converging to the same point on @xmath8 . \n thus , this limit of @xmath42 exists but is not very interesting . \n however , an interesting limit can be taken by considering a new one - parameter family of metrics @xmath61 by @xmath62 so that @xmath63 by inspection , the limit of this family of metrics is simply , @xmath64 which is just the schwarzschild metric with mass @xmath65 . \n the meaning of this second limit can be understood as follows . as already discussed above \n , the one - parameter family of metrics ( [ eq : family ] ) describes the exterior gravitational field of a spherical body or black hole that shrinks to zero size and mass as @xmath35 . \n the second limit corresponds to how this family of spacetimes looks to the family of observers placed at the events labeled by fixed values of @xmath58 . in going from , say , the @xmath66 to the @xmath67 spacetime \n , each observer will see that the body / black hole has shrunk in size and mass by a factor of @xmath68 and each observer also will find himself `` closer to the origin '' by this same factor of @xmath68 . \n suppose now that this family of observers also `` changes units '' by this same factor of @xmath68 , i.e. , they use centimeters rather than meters to measure distances . \n then , except for small effects due to the desitter background , the family of observers for the @xmath67 spacetime will report the same results ( expressed in centimeters ) as the observers for the @xmath66 spacetime had reported ( in meters ) . in the limit as @xmath35 , \n these observers simply see a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath65 , since the effects of the desitter background on what these observers will report disappear entirely in this limit . \n we will refer to the first type of limit ( i.e. , the limit as @xmath35 of @xmath42 taken at fixed @xmath51 ) as the _ ordinary limit _ of @xmath42 , and we will refer to the second limit ( i.e. , the limit as @xmath35 of @xmath69 taken at fixed @xmath58 ) as the _ scaled limit _ of @xmath42 . \n the simultaneous existence of both types of the above limits contains a great deal of relevant information about the one - parameter family of spacetimes ( [ eq : family ] ) . \n in essence , the existence of the first type of limit is telling us that the body / black hole is shrinking down to a worldline @xmath8 , with its mass going to zero ( at least ) as rapidly as its radius . \n the existence of the second type of limit is telling us that the body / black hole is shrinking to zero size in an asymptotically self - similar manner : in particular , its mass is proportional to its size , its shape is not changing , and it is not undergoing any ( high frequency ) oscillations in time . figure [ fig:2limits - spacetime ] illustrates the two limits we consider .    , the body shrinks and finally disappears , leaving behind a smooth background spacetime with a preferred world - line , @xmath8 , picked out . \n the solid lines illustrate this `` ordinary limit '' of @xmath35 at fixed @xmath70 , which is taken along paths that terminate away from @xmath8 ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) . \n by contrast , the `` scaled limit '' as @xmath35 , shown in dashed lines , is taken along paths at fixed @xmath72 that converge to a point on @xmath8.,width=288 ]    we wish now to abstract from the above example the general conditions to impose upon one - parameter families that express in a simple and precise way the condition that we have an arbitrary body ( or black hole ) that is shrinking to zero size  in an asymptotically self - similar way  in an arbitrary background spacetime . \n most of the remainder of this paper will be devoted to obtaining `` equations of motion '' for these bodies that are accurate enough to include gravitational self - force effects . \n a first attempt at specifying the type of one - parameter families @xmath42 that we seek is as follows :    * \\(i ) _ existence of the `` ordinary limit '' _ : \n @xmath42 is such that there exists coordinates @xmath73 such that @xmath74 is jointly smooth in @xmath75 , at least for @xmath76 for some constant @xmath77 , where @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) . for all @xmath2 and for @xmath76 \n , @xmath42 is a vacuum solution of einstein s equation . \n furthermore , @xmath80 is smooth in @xmath73 , including at @xmath81 , and , for @xmath82 , the curve @xmath8 defined by @xmath81 is timelike . \n * \\(ii ) _ existence of the `` scaled limit '' _ : for each @xmath37 , we define @xmath55 , @xmath83 . \n then the metric @xmath84 is jointly smooth in @xmath85 for @xmath86 . \n here we have used the notation @xmath87 to denote the components of @xmath4 in the @xmath88 coordinates , whereas @xmath89 denotes the components of @xmath90 in the @xmath88 coordinates . \n it should be noted that , since the barred coordinates differ only by scale ( and shift of time origin ) from the corresponding unbarred coordinates , we have @xmath91 consequently , \n we have @xmath92 since there is a cancelation of the factors of @xmath2 resulting from the definition of @xmath90 and the coordinate rescalings . \n it also should be noted that there is a redundancy in our description of the one - parameter family of metrics when taking the scaled limit : we define a scaled limit for all values of @xmath37 , but these arise from a single one - parameter family of metrics @xmath42 . \n indeed , it is not difficult to see that we have @xmath93    in fact , our requirements on @xmath4 of the existence of both an `` ordinary limit '' and a `` scaled limit '' are not quite strong enough to properly specify the one - parameter families we seek . \n to explain this and obtain the desired strengthened condition , it is convenient to define the new variables @xmath94 where the range of @xmath95 is @xmath96 . let @xmath97 denote a component of @xmath42 in the coordinates @xmath73 . \n however , instead of viewing @xmath97 as a function of @xmath98 , we view @xmath97 as a function of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are defined in terms of @xmath102 by the usual formula for spherical polar angles . in terms of these new variables , taking the `` ordinary limit '' \n corresponds to letting @xmath103 at any fixed @xmath104 , whereas taking the `` scaled limit '' corresponds to letting @xmath105 at any fixed @xmath106 ( see figure [ fig:2limits - ab ] ) . \n now , our assumptions concerning the ordinary limit imply that , at fixed @xmath107 and at fixed @xmath108 , @xmath97 depends smoothly on @xmath95 , including at @xmath109 . on the other hand , our assumptions concerning the scaled limit \n imply that at fixed @xmath107 and at fixed @xmath106 , @xmath97 is smooth in @xmath110 . \n furthermore , the last condition in the ordinary limit implies that for @xmath109 and fixed @xmath107 , @xmath97 is smooth in @xmath110 , including at @xmath111 . \n thus , at fixed @xmath107 , our previously stated assumptions imply that @xmath97 is well defined at the `` origin '' @xmath112 , and is smooth in @xmath110 along the @xmath110-axis ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) . however , our previously stated assumptions do not say anything about the continuity or smoothness of @xmath97 as @xmath113 from directions other than along the @xmath110-axis . \n such limiting behavior would correspond to letting @xmath114 as @xmath35 but at a rate _ \n slower _ than @xmath2 , i.e. , such that @xmath115 . to see the meaning and relevance of this limiting behavior , \n let us return to our original motivating example , eq . \n ( [ eq : family ] ) and take @xmath97 to be the time - time component of this metric to `` cartesian - like '' coordinates @xmath102 that are well behaved at the origin @xmath116 when @xmath38 ] . in terms of our new variables ( [ alphabeta ] ) \n , we have @xmath118 which is jointly smooth in @xmath119 at @xmath120 . by contrast , suppose we had a one - parameter family of metrics @xmath121 that satisfies our above assumptions about the ordinary and scaled limits , but fails to be jointly smooth in @xmath119 at @xmath120 . \n for example , suppose the time - time component of such a one - parameter family varied as @xmath122 in terms of the original variables @xmath123 , this corresponds to behavior of the form @xmath124 if we take the `` ordinary limit '' ( @xmath35 at fixed @xmath71 ) of @xmath125 , we find that @xmath125 smoothly goes to @xmath126 . \n similarly , if we take the `` scaled limit '' ( @xmath127 at fixed @xmath128 ) , we also find that @xmath125 smoothly goes to @xmath126 . \n however , suppose we let @xmath35 but let @xmath70 go to zero as @xmath129 . \n then @xmath125 will approach a different limit , namely @xmath130 . \n in essence , @xmath131 corresponds to a one - parameter family in which there is a `` bump of curvature '' at @xmath132 . \n although this `` bump of curvature '' does not register when one takes the ordinary or scaled limits , it is present in the one - parameter family of spacetimes and represents unacceptable limiting behavior as @xmath35 of this one - parameter family .    in order to eliminate this kind of non - uniform behavior in @xmath2 and @xmath70 \n , we now impose the following addtional condition :    * \\(iii ) _ uniformity condition _ : \n each component of @xmath42 in the coordinates @xmath51 is a jointly smooth function of the variables @xmath133 at @xmath120 ( at fixed @xmath134 ) , where @xmath110 and @xmath95 are defined by eq.([alphabeta ] ) . \n assumptions ( i)-(iii ) constitute all of the conditions that we shall impose on @xmath42 . \n no additional assumptions will be made in this paper . \n we note that the coordinate freedom allowed by our conditions are precisely all coordinate transformations @xmath135 such that @xmath136 is jointly smooth in @xmath137 for all @xmath138 for some constant @xmath139 , and such that the jacobian matrix @xmath140 is jointly smooth in @xmath119 at @xmath120 at fixed @xmath134 . \n it should be emphasized that our assumtions place absolutely no restrictions on the one - parameter family of spacetimes for @xmath141 , i.e. , this portion of these spacetimes could equally well be `` filled in '' with ordinary matter or a black hole satisfying our assumptions . ] . \n it also should be noted that the `` large @xmath70 '' region of the spacetime will not be relevant to any of our considerations , so it is only necessary that our conditions hold for @xmath142 for some constant @xmath143 . \n finally , although it may not be obvious upon first reading , we note that our assumptions concerning @xmath0 are closely related to the assumptions made in matched asymptotic expansion analyses . \n as we shall see in the next section , in essence , our assumption about the existence of an ordinary limit of @xmath0 corresponds to assuming the existence of a `` far zone '' expansion ; our assumption about the existence of a scaled limit of @xmath0 corresponds to assuming the existence of a `` near zone '' expansion ; and our uniformity assumption corresponds closely to the assumption of the existence of a `` buffer zone '' where both expansions are valid . \n in this section , we derive some immediate consequences of the assumptions of the previous section that will play a key role in our analysis . \n these results will follow directly from the `` uniformity condition '' and the consistency relation ( [ consist ] ) .    since , by the uniformity assumption , the coordinate components of the one - parameter family of metrics @xmath42 are jointly smooth in the variables @xmath119 at @xmath120 , we may approximate @xmath144 by a joint taylor series in @xmath110 and @xmath95 to any finite orders @xmath145 and @xmath32 by @xmath146 substituting for @xmath110 and @xmath95 from eq.([alphabeta ] ) , we have @xmath147 where here and in the following , we drop the error term \n . we can rewrite this equation as a perturbation expansion in @xmath2 : @xmath148 we will refer to eq.([eq : rseries ] ) as the _ far zone expansion _ of @xmath42 . \n it should be noted that the @xmath149th - order term in @xmath2 in the far zone perturbation expansion has leading order behavior of @xmath150 at small @xmath70 . \n however , arbitrarily high positive powers of @xmath70 may occur at each order in @xmath2 . \n finally , we note that the angular dependence of @xmath151 is further restricted by the requirement that the metric components @xmath152 must be smooth at @xmath50 when re - expressed as functions of @xmath102 . \n in particular , this implies that @xmath153 can not have any angular dependence . \n equivalently , in view of eq.([barg ] ) , we can expand @xmath89 as @xmath154 by further expanding @xmath155 in @xmath156 about @xmath157 , we obtain @xmath158 where @xmath159 we can rewrite this as a perturbation series expansion in @xmath2 : @xmath160 we will refer to eq.([eq : fullnearzone ] ) as the _ near zone expansion _ of @xmath42 . \n we see from this formula that the scaled metric , viewed as a perturbation series in @xmath2 , follows the rule that the combined powers of @xmath156 and @xmath72 are allowed to be only as positive as the order in perturbation theory . \n by contrast inverse powers of @xmath72 of arbitrarily high order are always allowed . of course \n , only non - negative powers of @xmath156 can occur .    by inspection of eq.([eq : fullnearzone ] ) , we see that the `` background '' ( @xmath82 ) scaled metric is given by @xmath161 where we have used the fact that @xmath162 . thus , we see that there is no dependence of @xmath163 on @xmath156 and only non - positive powers of @xmath72 occur . \n _ thus , we see that @xmath164 is a stationary , asymptotically flat spacetime . \n _ however , the limiting , stationary , asymtotically flat spacetime that we obtain may depend on the choice of the time , @xmath37 , on the worldline , @xmath8 , about which the scaling is done . \n our `` far zone expansion '' , eq.([eq : rseries ] ) , appears to correspond closely to the far zone expansion used in matched asymptotic expansion analyses @xcite . \n however , our `` near zone expansion '' differs in that we define a separate expansion for each time @xmath37 rather than attempting a uniform in time approximation with a single expansion . \n such expansions require an additional `` quasi - static '' or slow - time variation assumption for the evolution of the metric perturbations . \n a further difference is that the conclusion that the background ( @xmath38 ) metric is stationary and asymptotically flat has been derived here rather than assumed . indeed , in other analyses , a particular form of the background metric ( such as the schwarzschild metric ) is assumed , and the possibility that this metric form might change with time ( i.e. , depend upon @xmath37 ) is not considered . \n in addition , in other analyses boundary conditions at small @xmath72 ( such as regularity on the schwarzschild horizon ) are imposed . in our analysis \n , we make no assumptions other than the assumptions ( i)-(iii ) stated in the previous section . in particular , since we make no assumptions about the form of the metric for @xmath165 , we do not impose any boundary conditions at small @xmath72 . \n finally , it is also useful to express the consistency relation ( [ consist ] ) in a simple , differential form . \n we define @xmath166 then , a short calculation shows that @xmath167 as well as @xmath168 setting @xmath169 , we see that the last relation implies that @xmath170 is stationary , as we have already noted . \n in this section , we will prove that the worldline @xmath8 appearing in assumption ( i ) of section [ sec : example ] must , in fact , be a geodesic of the background metric @xmath171 . \n this can be interpreted as establishing that , to zeroth order in @xmath2 , any body ( or black hole ) moves on a geodesic of the background spacetime . \n in fact , we will show considerably more than this : we will show that , to first order in @xmath2 , the far zone description of @xmath42 is that of a `` point particle '' . as previously mentioned in the introduction , \n our derivation of geodesic motion is similar in spirit to that of @xcite in that we consider one - parameter families of solutions with a worldtube that shrinks down to a curve @xmath8 , but the nature of the one - parameter families that we consider here are very different from those considered by @xcite , and our proof of geodesic motion is very different as well . \n our derivation of geodesic motion also appears to differ significantly from pervious derivations using matched asymptotic expansions @xcite . \n we begin by writing the lowest order terms in the far zone expansion , eq . \n ( [ eq : rseries ] ) , as follows : @xmath172 + o(\\lambda^2)\\ , , r>0 \\,\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the fact that @xmath173 can depend only on @xmath174 , as noted in the previous section . since the worldline @xmath8 , given by @xmath116 , was assumed to be timelike \n however , if , instead , we had assumed that the `` interior region '' @xmath175 , were `` filled in '' with matter satisfying the dominant energy condition , then it should be possible to prove that @xmath8 must be timelike . \n ] in the spacetime @xmath176 , without loss of generality , we may choose our coordinates @xmath73 so that @xmath177 . ( \n one such possible choice of coordinates would be fermi normal coordinates with respect to @xmath8 in the metric @xmath176 . \n we emphasize that we make the coordinate choice @xmath178 purely for convenience  so that , e.g. , coordinate time coincides with proper time on @xmath8but it plays no essential role in our arguments . ) \n choosing these coordinates , and letting @xmath179 denote the @xmath180 piece of the metric , we see that @xmath181 takes the form @xmath182 where @xmath183 where in eq.([eq : perturbations - series ] ) , the term `` @xmath184 '' denotes a term that , when multiplied by @xmath185 for any @xmath186 , vanishes as @xmath187 . \n now , by assumption ( i ) of section [ sec : example ] , for each @xmath2 , @xmath0 is a vacuum solution of einstein s equation for @xmath188 and is jointly smooth in @xmath98 in this coordinate range . \n it follows that for all @xmath189 , @xmath3 is a solution the linearized einstein equation off of @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath190 = -\\frac{1}{2 } \\nabla_a \\nabla_b h^c_{\\ c } - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^c\\nabla_c h_{ab } + \\nabla^c \\nabla_{(b}h_{a)c } = 0 , \\,\\ ,   r>0 \\,\\ , , \\label{lee}\\ ] ] where here and in the following , @xmath191 denotes the derivative operator associated with @xmath1 , and indices are raised and lowered with @xmath1 . equation ( [ lee ] ) holds only for @xmath189 , and , indeed , if @xmath192 , @xmath3 is singular at @xmath193 . \n however , even if @xmath192 , the singularity of each component of @xmath3 is locally integrable with respect to the volume element associated with @xmath171 , i.e. , each component , @xmath179 , is a locally @xmath194 function on the entire spacetime manifold , including @xmath50 . _ \n thus , @xmath3 is well defined as a distribution on all of spacetime . _ \n the quantity @xmath195/8 \\pi$ ] is therefore automatically well defined as a distribution . \n this quantity has the interpretation of being the `` source '' for the metric perturbation ( [ eq : perturbations - series])even though all of our spacetimes @xmath42 for @xmath54 have excluded the `` source region '' @xmath196 . \n it follows immediately from eq.([lee ] ) that , as a distribution , @xmath197 must have support on @xmath8 in the sense that it must vanish when acting on any test tensor field @xmath198 whose support does not intersect @xmath8 . \n we now compute @xmath197 .    by definition , @xmath195/8 \\pi$ ] \n is the distribution on spacetime whose action on an arbitrary smooth , compact support , symmetric tensor field @xmath199 is given by @xmath200 h^{ab } \\sqrt{-g } d^4x = 0 \\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath201 denotes the volume element associated with @xmath171 and we have used the fact that the operator @xmath202 is self -

equation ] ) by integrating over the region @xmath205 and then taking the limit as @xmath206 . in the region \n @xmath207 , @xmath204 is smooth , and a straightforward `` integration by parts '' calculation shows that @xmath208 h^{ab } -

series ] ) and ( [ eq : adjoint - current ] ) , we find that @xmath213 takes the form @xmath214 where @xmath215 is a smooth , symmetric ( @xmath216 ) tensor field on @xmath8 whose components are given in terms of suitable angular averages of @xmath217 and its first angular derivatives . \n in other words , the distribution @xmath197 is given by on @xmath8 and @xmath218 , but we prefer to leave in these factors so that this formula holds for an arbitrary choice of coordinates . ] @xmath219 where @xmath220 is the `` coordinate delta - function '' ( i.e. , @xmath221 ) . \n we now use the fact that , since the differential operator @xmath202 satisfies the linearized bianchi identity @xmath222 , the distribution @xmath197 must satisfy @xmath223 in the distributional sense . \n this means that the action of @xmath197 must vanish on any test tensor field of the form @xmath224 where @xmath225 is smooth and of compact support . in other words , by eq . \n ( [ tn ] ) , the tensor field @xmath226 on @xmath8 must be such that for an arbitrary smooth vector field @xmath227 on spacetime , we have @xmath228 now for any @xmath79 , choose @xmath227 to have components of the form @xmath229 , where each @xmath230 ( @xmath231 ) is an arbitrary smooth function of compact support in @xmath174 and @xmath232 is a smooth function of compact spatial support , with @xmath233 in a neighborhood of @xmath8 . \n then eq . \n ( [ nf ] ) yields @xmath234 for all @xmath235 , which immediately implies that @xmath236 for all @xmath79 and all @xmath231 . in other words \n , we have shown that @xmath215 must take the form @xmath237 where @xmath7 denotes the unit tangent to @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath7 is the 4-velocity of @xmath8 . \n now choose @xmath227 to be an arbitrary smooth vector field of compact support . \n then eqs . \n ( [ nf ] ) and ( [ n ] ) yield @xmath238 where we integrated by parts in @xmath174 to obtain the last equality . \n since @xmath227 is arbitrary , this immediately implies that @xmath239 this , in turn , implies that @xmath240 i.e. , @xmath32 is a constant along @xmath8 , and , if @xmath241 , @xmath242 i.e. , in the case where @xmath241 , @xmath8 is a geodesic of @xmath176 , as we desired to show .. it is critical that this assumption be used in any valid derivation of geodesic motion , since a derivation that holds for @xmath243 effectively would show that all curves are geodesics . ]    in summary , we have shown that for any one - parameter family of metrics @xmath42 satisfying assumptions ( i)-(iii ) of section [ sec : example ] , to first order in @xmath2 , the far zone metric perturbation @xmath3 corresponds to a solution to the linearized einstein equation with a point particle source @xmath244 where @xmath32 is a constant and @xmath7 is the 4-velocity of @xmath8 , which must be a geodesic if @xmath241 . \n we refer to @xmath32 as the _ mass _ of the particle . \n it is rather remarkable that the point particle source ( [ ptparticle ] ) is an _ \n output _ of our analysis rather than an input . \n indeed , we maintain that the result we have just derived is what provides the justification for the notion of `` point particles''a notion that has played a dominant role in classical physics for more than three centuries . \n in fact , the notion of point particles makes no mathematical sense in the context of nonlinear field theories like general relativity . \n nevertheless , we have just shown that the notion of a ( structureless ) `` point particle '' arises naturally as an _ approximate _ description of sufficiently small bodies \n namely , a description that is valid to first order in @xmath2 in the far zone for arbitrary one - parameter families of metrics @xmath42 satisfying the assumptions of section [ sec : example ] . \n this description is valid independently of the nature of the `` body '' , e.g. , it holds with equal validity for a small black hole as for a small blob of ordinary matter . \n in the previous section , we established that , to zeroth order in @xmath2 , any body ( or black hole ) of nonvanishing mass moves on a geodesic of the background spacetime . \n much of the remainder of this paper will be devoted to finding the corrections to this motion , valid to first order in @xmath2 in the far zone . in this section \n , we address the issue of what is meant by the `` motion of the body '' to first order in @xmath2 . \n the first point that should be clearly recognized is that it is far from obvious how to describe `` motion '' in terms of a worldline for @xmath54 . \n indeed , the metric @xmath42 is defined only for @xmath188 , so at finite @xmath2 the spacetime metric may not even be defined in a neighborhood of @xmath8 . \n if we were to assume that @xmath245 and that the region @xmath246 were `` filled in '' with sufficiently `` weak field matter''so that @xmath247 , where @xmath248 denotes the supremum of the components of the riemann curvature tensor of @xmath61 in the `` filled in '' region  then it should be possible to define a `` center of mass '' worldline at finite @xmath2 , and we could use this worldline to characterize the motion of the body @xcite . however , we do not wish to make any `` weak field '' assumptions here , since we wish to describe to motion of small black holes and other `` strong field '' objects . \n since it is not clear how to associate a worldline to the body at finite @xmath2and , indeed , the `` body '' is excluded from the spacetime region we consider at finite @xmath2it is not clear what one would mean by a `` perturbative correction '' to @xmath8 to first or higher order in @xmath2 . \n a second point that should be understood is that if we have succeeded in defining the worldlines describing the motion the body at finite @xmath2 , @xmath249 then the `` first order in @xmath2 perturbative correction '' , @xmath29 , to the zeroth order motion @xmath8 ( given by @xmath250 ) is most properly viewed as the spatial components of a vector field , @xmath251 , defined along @xmath8 . \n this vector field describes the `` infinitesimal displacement '' to the corrected motion to first order in @xmath2 . \n the time component , @xmath252 , of @xmath251 depends on on how we identify the time parameter of the worldlines at different values of @xmath2 and is not physically relevant ; we will set @xmath253 so that @xmath251 is orthogonal to the tangent , @xmath7 , to @xmath8 in the background metric @xmath176 . \n thus , when we seek equations of motion describing the first order perturbative corrections to geodesic motion , we are seeking equations satisfied by the vector field @xmath254 on @xmath8 . \n a third point that should be clearly recognized is that @xmath251 and any equations of motion satisfied by @xmath251 will depend on our choice of gauge for @xmath3 . to see this explicitly , \n suppose that we perform a smooth is not smooth at @xmath116 are also permitted under the coordinate freedom stated at the end of section [ sec : example ] . \n however , it suffices to consider smooth @xmath255 for our consderations here . \n the change in the description of motion under non - smooth gauge transformations will be treated in appendix a. ] gauge transformation of the form @xmath256 under this gauge transformation , we have @xmath257 however , clearly , the new description of motion will be of the form @xcite @xmath258 where @xmath259 thus , we see that @xmath251 transforms as @xmath260 in order that it describe the same perturbed motion . thus , the first order correction , @xmath254 , to the background geodesic motion contains no meaningful information by itself and , indeed , it can always be set to zero by a smooth gauge transformation . only the pair @xmath261 has gauge invariant meaning . \n we turn now to the definition of the first order perturbed motion . \n our definition relies on the fact , proven in section [ sec : assumptions ] above , that for each @xmath37 , @xmath262 is a stationary , asymptotically flat spacetime . \n therefore , @xmath164 has well defined sets of mass ( `` electric parity '' ) and angular momentum ( `` magnetic parity '' ) multipole moments @xcite and , indeed , the spacetime is characterized by the values of these two sets of multipole moments @xcite . \n the multipole moments ( other than the lowest nonvanishing multipoles of each type ) depend upon a choice of conformal factor @xcite , which , rougly speaking , corresponds to a choice of `` origin '' . \n we choose the conformal factor @xmath263 to define all of the multipoles , corresponding to choosing the origin at @xmath264 . for a metric of the form eq . \n ( [ eq : fullnearzone2])with @xmath265 by our coordinate choice imposed in the previous section that @xmath266 on @xmath8the mass will be simply the @xmath267 part of the coefficient of @xmath268 in the large @xmath72 expansion of @xmath269 . similarly , the mass dipole moment will be the coefficient of the @xmath270 part of this quantity at order @xmath271 . \n it is well known that if the mass is nonzero , the mass dipole moment is `` pure gauge '' and can be set to zero by choice of conformal factor/``origin '' . \n we now explicitly show that , with our choice of conformal factor @xmath263 , the mass dipole moment can be set to zero by a smooth gauge transformation of the form ( [ eq : transform ] ) . \n it follows from the linearized einstein equation ( [ lee ] ) with source ( [ ptparticle ] ) applied to @xmath3 , eq . \n ( [ eq : perturbations - series ] ) , that the time - time component of @xmath3 takes the form @xmath272 i.e. , in the notation of eq .  ( \n [ eq : rseries ] ) , we have @xmath273 . comparing with eq . \n ( [ eq : fullnearzone ] ) ( and also using the fact that @xmath274 ) , we see that at each @xmath37 @xmath275 from this equation , we see that the `` particle mass '' , @xmath32 , of the `` source '' of the far zone metric perturbation ( see eq . \n ( [ ptparticle ] ) ) is also the komar / adm mass of the stationary , asymptotically flat spacetime @xmath276 . \n we now calculate the effect of the coordinate transformation ( [ eq : transform ] ) on @xmath277 . \n the transformation ( [ eq : transform ] ) corresponds to changing the barred coordinates by @xmath278 i.e. , to zeroth order in @xmath2 , it corresponds to a `` constant displacement '' of coordinates . since @xmath279 \n it can be seen that this transformation have the effect of changing the mass dipole moment by @xmath280 . in particular \n , we can always choose @xmath281 so as to set the mass dipole moment to zero . \n now , the `` near zone '' coordinates @xmath282 for which the mass dipole moment vanishes have the interpretation of being `` body centered '' coordinates to zeroth order in @xmath2 . \n the origin @xmath283 of the corresponding `` far zone '' coordinates @xmath284 therefore has the interpretation of representing the `` position '' of the center of mass of the body to first order in @xmath2 . \n we shall use this to define the correction to geodesic motion to first order in @xmath2 by proceeding as follows :    first , we shall choose our coordinates , @xmath51 , to zeroth order in @xmath2 by choosing convenient coordinates for the `` background spacetime '' @xmath176 . \n ( we will use fermi normal coordinates based on @xmath8 . ) next , we will define our coordinates , @xmath51 , to first order in @xmath2 by choosing a convenient gauge for @xmath3 , eq . \n ( [ eq : perturbations - series ] ) . \n ( we will choose the lorenz gauge @xmath285 . ) \n then we will introduce the smooth coordinate transformation ( [ eq : transform ] ) , and impose the requirement that @xmath286 be such that the mass dipole moment of @xmath276 vanish for all @xmath37 . since the `` location '' of the body in the new coordinates is @xmath287 , the first order perturbative correction @xmath254 to the motion of the body in our original coordinates @xmath51 will be given by @xmath288 of course , the particular @xmath254 that we obtain in any given case will depend upon the particular one - parameter family @xmath42 that we consider . \n what is of interest is any `` universal relations '' satisfied by @xmath254 that are independent of the choice of one - parameter family satisfying assumptions ( i)-(iii ) of section [ sec : example ] . such universal relations would provide us with `` laws of motion '' for point particles that take self - force effects into account . in the next section , we will show ( via a lengthy calculation ) that such a universal relation exists for @xmath289 , thus providing us with general `` equations of motion '' for all `` point particles '' , valid to first order in @xmath2 . \n finally , we note that if we wish to describe motion beyond first order in @xmath2 , it will be necessary to define a `` representative world line '' in the far zone to at least second order in @xmath2 . \n we shall not attempt to do so in this paper . \n the definition of a suitable representative worldline is probably the greatest obstacle to extending the results of this paper to higher order in perturbation theory . \n in the section [ sec : geodesic ] we found that first - order far zone perturbations of the background spacetime @xmath176 are sourced by a point particle stress - energy , eq . \n ( [ ptparticle ] ) . for the remainder of this paper \n , we will assume that @xmath241 , so that , as shown in section [ sec : geodesic ] , the lowest order motion is described by a geodesic , @xmath8 , of the background spacetime . \n we will need expressions for the components of the far zone metric , @xmath290 , its first order perturbation , @xmath291 , and its second order perturbation @xmath292 . \n it is convenient to choose our coordinates @xmath51 to zeroth order in @xmath2 to be fermi normal coordinates with respect to the background geodesic @xmath8 , and choose these coordinates to first order in @xmath2 so that @xmath293 satisfies the lorenz gauge condition @xmath294 , where @xmath295 with @xmath296 . \n then the linearized einstein equation reads @xmath297    this system of equations can be solved using the hadamard expansion techniques of dewitt and brehme @xcite . since this technology has been used in all previous derivations of gravitational self - force , we do not review it here but simply present results . \n equation ( 2.27 ) of mino , sasaki , and tanaka @xcite provides a covariant expression for the perturbations in terms of parallel propagators and synge s world function on the background metric ( see , e.g. , reference @xcite for definitions of these quantities ) . \n the fermi normal coordinate components of these tensors are easily calculated with the aid of expressions from section 8 of poisson @xcite . combining this with the form of the background metric in fermi normal \n coordinates , we obtain @xmath298 where the quantities @xmath299 and @xmath300 are defined by the following expressions in terms of the fermi normal coordinate components of the riemann tensor of the background metric @xmath301 and @xmath302 and @xmath303 are given by @xmath304 in these expressions , @xmath305 is the lorenz gauge retarded green s function , normalized with a factor of @xmath306 , following @xcite . \n as previously mentioned , the symbol @xmath23 indicates that the range of the integral extends just short of the retarded time @xmath24 , so that only the `` tail '' ( i.e. , interior of the light cone ) portion of the green s function is used ( see , e.g. , reference @xcite for details ) . \n we define @xmath303 , rather than working with derivatives of @xmath302 , because @xmath302 is not differentiable on the worldline . \n ( however , this non - differentiability is limited only to spatial derivatives of spatial components of @xmath302 on the worldline @xmath8 yields @xmath303 plus the coincidence limit of the integrand of , which is proportional to @xmath307 times the gradient of @xmath24 . \n ] , so that expressions expressions like are well - defined . ) a choice of retarded solution ( corresponding to `` no incoming radiation '' ) was made in writing these equations . \n this choice is not necessary , and one could add an arbitrary smooth solution @xmath179 of the linearized einstein equation to the first order in @xmath2 term on the right side of eq . \n ( [ eq : metric ] ) , which could then be carried through all of our calculations straightforwardly . \n however , for simplicity , we will not consider the addition of such a term .    our derivation of gravitational self - force to \n first order in @xmath2 will require consideration of second - order metric perturbations , so we will have to carry the expansion of @xmath42 somewhat beyond eq . \n ( [ eq : metric ] ) . \n ( this should not be surprising in view of fact that our above derivation in section [ sec : geodesic ] of geodesic motion at zeroth order in @xmath2 , required consideration of first - order metric perturbations . ) in particular , we will need an explicit expression for the quantity @xmath308 appearing in the far zone expansion eq . \n ( [ eq : rseries ] ) , i.e. , the term of order @xmath26 that has the most singular behavior in @xmath309 ( namely , @xmath310 ) . \n the second - order perturbation @xmath311 satisfies the second - order einstein equation , which takes the form @xmath312 = - g^{(2)}_{ab}[h , h]\\ ] ] where @xmath313 denotes the second order einstein tensor about the background metric @xmath314 . since the @xmath315 part of @xmath3 corresponds to the linearized schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates ( see eq . \n ( [ eq : metric ] ) ) , it is clear that there is a particular solution to eq . \n ( [ eq : e2 ] ) of the form @xmath316 as @xmath187 , where @xmath317 and @xmath318 , whereas @xmath319 . \n ( the explicitly written term on the right side of eq . \n ( [ ji ] ) is just the @xmath320 part of the schwarzschild metric in isotropic coordinates . ) \n the general solution to eq . \n ( [ eq : e2 ] ) can then be written as @xmath321 where @xmath322 is a homogeneous solution of the linearized einstein equation . \n we wish to compute the @xmath323 part of @xmath322 , i.e. , writing @xmath324 we wish to compute @xmath325 . \n now , although the equations of motion to first order in @xmath2 depend upon a choice of gauge to first order in @xmath2 ( see section [ sec : dipole ] ) , they can not depend upon a choice of gauge to second order in @xmath2 , since a second order gauge transformation can not affect the mass dipole moment of the background scaled metric @xmath326 . \n ( we have also verified by a direct , lengthy computation that second order gauge transformations do not produce changes in the equations of motion to first order in @xmath2 . ) \n therefore , we are free to impose any ( admissible ) second order gauge condition on @xmath322 \n . it will be convenient to require that the lorenz gauge condition @xmath327 be satisfied to order @xmath328 . \n the @xmath329 part of the linearized einstein equation together with the @xmath330 part of the lorenz gauge condition then yields @xmath331 where @xmath332 . \n this system of equations for @xmath333 is the same system of equations as is satisfied by stationary solutions of the flat spacetime linearized einstein equation ( but our @xmath334 may depend on time ) . \n the general solution of these equations is @xmath335 , @xmath336 , and @xmath337 , where @xmath33 is antisymmetric , @xmath338 , where @xmath232 , @xmath33 , and @xmath339 have no spatial dependence , and where @xmath340 was defined by eq . \n ( [ ni ] ) . by a further second order gauge transformation ( of the form @xmath341 ) , we can set @xmath342 . \n we thus obtain @xmath343 which is of the same form as the general stationary @xmath270 perturbation of minkowski spacetime ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , except that time dependence is allowed for @xmath33 and @xmath339 . \n as we shall see shortly , @xmath33 and @xmath339 correspond , respectively , to the spin and mass dipole moment of the body . \n we now may write for the metric through @xmath344 , @xmath345 where we have introduced the unknown tensors @xmath143 and @xmath346 , and @xmath347 is the antisymmetric tensor whose spatial components are @xmath33 and whose time components vanish , i.e. , @xmath348    we now follow the strategy outlined in section [ sec : dipole ] . \n we consider a _ smooth _ \n coordinate shift of the form , @xmath349 and choose @xmath286 so as to make the mass dipole moment of @xmath350 vanish for all @xmath37 . a straightforward application of the coordinate transformation ( [ eq : transform2 ] ) to the metric ( [ eq : metric2 ] ) yields @xmath351 n^i

of the @xmath51-components of @xmath358 with respect to the @xmath51 coordinates arises from taylor expanding @xmath359 with respect to the @xmath356 coordinates , so , in principle , the second

] ) to the near zone expansion eq . \n ( [ eq : scaled - metric ] ) should be noted . \n for example , the spin term @xmath368 originated as a second order perturbation in the far zone , but it now appears as part of the background scaled metric in the near zone expansion . \n by contrast , the term @xmath369 originated as part of the background metric in the far zone , but it now appears as a second order perturbation in the near zone expansion . \n it is easy to see from eq . \n ( [ eq : scaled - metric ] ) that @xmath370 is the mass dipole moment of @xmath371 at time @xmath37 . \n we therefore set @xmath372 for all @xmath174 . \n consequently , no mass dipole term will appear in our expressions below .    although we have `` solved '' for @xmath281 in eq . \n ( [ ap ] ) , we have not learned anything useful about the motion . \n is equivalent to simply determining the mass dipole moment @xmath373 in the original coordinates . \n the computations of this section may therefore be recast as simply solving enough of the second - order perturbation equations for the mass dipole moment  and hence the motion  to be determined . ] \n all useful information about @xmath281 will come from demanding that the metrics @xmath42or , equivalently , @xmath61be solutions of einstein s equation . \n we may apply einstein s equation perturbatively either via the far zone expansion or the near zone expansion . \n the resulting systems of equations are entirely equivalent , but the terms are organized very differently . \n we find it more convenient to work with the near zone expansion , and will do so below . \n we emphasize , however , that we could equally well have used the far zone perturbation expansion . \n we also emphasize that no new information whatsoever can be generated by matching the near and far zone expansions , since these expansions have already been fully `` matched '' via eqs . \n ( [ eq : rseries ] ) , ( [ bnmp ] ) , and ( [ eq : fullnearzone ] ) .

have occassion to use both @xmath356 and @xmath51 below . using this notation and setting the mass dipole terms to zero , eq . \n ( [ eq : scaled - metric ] ) becomes @xmath376 \\\\ & \\quad +

the vacuum linearized einstein equation  up to leading order , @xmath377 , in @xmath268 as @xmath378to the first order term in @xmath2 appearing in eq . \n ( [ eq : scaled - metric2 ] ) , namely @xmath379 it is clear that the terms of order @xmath271 and @xmath380 in @xmath381 can not contribute to the linearized ricci tensor to order @xmath377 . \n similarly , it is clear that the terms of order @xmath271 and higher in the background scaled metric can not contribute to the linearized ricci tensor to order @xmath377 , so , to order @xmath377 , we see that @xmath382 satisfies the linearized einstein equation about the schwarzschild metric . \n it is therefore useful to expand @xmath382 in tensor spherical harmonics . \n we obtain one very useful piece of information by extracting the @xmath383 , magnetic parity part of the linearized ricci tensor that is even under time reversal . on account of the symmetries of the background schwarzschild metric \n , only the @xmath383 , magnetic parity , even under time reversal part of the metric perturbation can contribute . \n now , a general @xmath383 , symmetric ( but not necessarily trace free ) tensor field @xmath384 can be expanded in tensor spherical harmonics as ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite equations ( a16 - 18 ) ) @xmath385 where the expansion coefficients @xmath386 are functions of @xmath387 . \n the three - vector index on these coefficients corresponds to the three different `` @xmath149-values '' for each @xmath383 harmonic . \n thus , we see that there are a grand total of eight types of @xmath383 tensor spherical harmonics . \n the six harmonics associated with labeling indices @xmath388 are of electric parity , whereas the two harmonics associated with @xmath389 are of magnetic parity .    for the metric perturbation ( [ eq : scaled-1 ] ) \n the `` constant tensors '' @xmath365 and @xmath390 are purely electric parity and can not contribute . \n it turns out that @xmath391 also does not contribute to the @xmath383 , magnetic parity part of the linearized ricci tensor that is even under time reversal : since @xmath392 is independent of @xmath156 the `` @xmath32 '' part of @xmath392 is odd under time reversal , whereas the `` @xmath145 '' part of @xmath391 is pure gauge . \n thus , the only term that contributes to order @xmath377 to the @xmath383 , magnetic parity part of of the linearized ricci tensor that is even under time reversal is @xmath393 . \n satisfaction of vacuum linearized einstein equation at order @xmath377 requires that this term vanish . \n we thereby learn that @xmath394 i.e. , to lowest order , the spin is parallelly propagated with respect to the background metric along the worldline @xmath8 . \n having set the spin term to zero in eq.([eq : scaled-1 ] ) , we may now substitute the remaining terms in eq . \n ( [ eq : scaled-1 ] ) into the linearized einstein equation and set the @xmath377 part equal to zero . \n it is clear that we will thereby obtain relations between @xmath395 , @xmath359 , and @xmath396 . \n however , these relations will not be of direct interest for obtaining `` equations of motion''i.e . , \n equations relating @xmath281 and its time derivatives to known quantities  because the quantity of interest @xmath397 always appears in combination with the quantity @xmath398 , which is unrelated to the motion . \n therefore , we shall not explicitly compute the relations arising from the linearized einstein equation here . \n we now consider the information on @xmath281 that can be obtained from the near zone second - order einstein equation @xmath399 = - g^{(2)}_{ab}[\\bar{g}^{(1 ) } , \\bar{g}^{(1)}],\\ ] ] where , from eq . \n ( [ eq : scaled - metric2 ] ) , we see that @xmath400 where we have defined @xmath401 we wish to impose the second order einstein equation to orders @xmath271 and @xmath380 , which , as we shall see below , are the lowest nontrivial orders in @xmath268 as @xmath378 that occur . \n first , we consider @xmath402 $ ] . \n the terms appearing in this quantity can be organized into terms of the following general forms ( i ) @xmath403 ; ( ii ) @xmath404 ; ( iii ) @xmath405 where @xmath406 denotes a christoffel symbol of the background scaled metric ; ( iv ) @xmath407 ; and ( v ) @xmath408 . from the form of @xmath409 \n together with the fact that @xmath410 and @xmath411 , it is clear that none of these terms can contribute to @xmath412 $ ] to order @xmath271 or @xmath380 . \n therefore , we may treat @xmath413 as satisfying the homogeneous , vacuum linearized einstein equation . \n we now consider the linearized ricci tensor of the perturbation @xmath413 . by inspection of eq . \n ( [ eq : scaled-2 ] ) , it might appear that terms that are @xmath184 ( from two partial derivatives acting on the `` b '' term ) and @xmath414 ( from various terms ) will arise . \n however , it is not difficult to show that the total contribution to the @xmath184 and @xmath414 terms will vanish by virtue of the fact that the metric @xmath171 is a solution to einstein s equation and the term proportional to @xmath2 in eq . \n ( [ eq : metric2 ] ) satisfies the far zone linearized einstein equation ( which has already been imposed ) . \n it also is clear that there is no contribution of @xmath413 to the linearized ricci tensor that is of order @xmath415 . \n thus , the lowest nontrivial orders that arise in the second order einstein equation are indeed @xmath271 and @xmath380 , as claimed above . \n the computation of the linearized ricci tensor to orders @xmath271 and @xmath380 for the metric perturbation @xmath413 is quite complicated , so we will save considerable labor by focusing on the relevant part of the linearized einstein equation to these orders . \n our hope / expectation ( which will be borne out by our calculation ) is to obtain an equation for @xmath416 . \n since this quantity is of @xmath383 , electric parity type and is even under time reversal , we shall focus on the @xmath383 , electric parity , even under time reversal part of the linearized ricci tensor of @xmath413 at orders @xmath271 and @xmath380 . from eq . \n ( [ eq : harmonics ] ) , we see that the @xmath383 electric parity part of the ricci tensor that is @xmath417 and even under time reversal can be written as @xmath418 whereas the @xmath383 part of the ricci tensor that is @xmath419 and even under time reversal can be written as @xmath420 here , in contrast to the usage of , @xmath421 are `` constants '' , i.e , they have no dependence on @xmath422 . \n we now consider the terms in @xmath413 that can contribute to these ricci terms . \n the term @xmath423 has no @xmath424 part . \n nevertheless , the @xmath425 magnetic parity part of this term can , in effect , combine with the @xmath383 magnetic parity `` spin term '' @xmath426 in the background scaled metric to produce a contribution to the linearized ricci tensor of the correct type . \n this contribution will be proportional to @xmath427    for the remaining terms in @xmath413 , the `` spin term '' @xmath426 in the background scaled metric will not contribute to the relevant parts of the linearized ricci tensor , so we may treat the remaining terms in @xmath413 as though they were perturbations of schwarzschild . \n thus , only the @xmath383 , electric parity , even under time reversal part of these terms can contribute . \n the remaining contributors to @xmath428 , and @xmath429 are @xmath430 and @xmath431 where , in eq . \n ( [ d ] ) , we have @xmath432(the curvature term @xmath300 has not appeared in the above equations because it has no @xmath383 part . ) \n the @xmath433 are also  constants \" in these expressions . \n a lengthy calculation now yields    @xmath434    using the vacuum linearized einstein equation @xmath435 , we thus obtain 6 linear equations for our 11 unknowns \n . however , in order to find `` universial '' behavior , we are interested in relations that do not involve @xmath436 and @xmath437 . it can be shown that there are two such relations in near - zone perturbation theory the vanishing of the value , time derivative , and second time derivative of the mass dipole at time @xmath37 . \n the third condition should follow from the first - order near - zone einstein equation , which we did not fully use . \n in fact , it should only be necessary to impose that the mass dipole have no second time derivative in order to define the motion . \n ] , namely @xmath438 and @xmath439 the first equation involves @xmath440 and spatial derivatives of @xmath281 , and does not yield restrictions on the motion . \n however , the second equation gives desired equations of motion . \n plugging in the definitions of the quantities appearing in eq . \n ( [ motion ] ) , we obtain @xmath441 where we have taken advantage of the fact ( noted above ) that for @xmath442 and @xmath443 components we have @xmath444 . using the equality of mixed partials \n @xmath445 , we obtain @xmath446 thus , according to the interpretation provided in section [ sec : dipole ] above , the first order perturbative correction , @xmath447 , to the geodesic @xmath8 of the background spacetime satisfies @xmath448 in addition , we have previously found that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are constant along @xmath8 . \n taking account of the fact that this equation is written in fermi normal coordinates of @xmath8 and that @xmath253 , we can rewrite this equation in a more manifestly covariant looking form as @xmath449 where @xmath7 is the tangent to @xmath8 and @xmath450 . \n however , it should be emphasized that this equation describes the perturbed motion only when the metric perturbation is in the lorenz gauge ( see appendix a ) .    the first term in eq . \n ( [ eq : eom ] ) ( or , equivalently , in eq . \n ( [ eq : eomcov ] ) ) is the `` spin force '' first obtained by papapetrou @xcite . \n contributions from higher multipole moments do not appear in our equation because they scale to zero faster than the spin dipole moment , and thus would arise at higher order in @xmath2 in our perturbation scheme . \n the second term corresponds to the right side of the geodesic deviation equation , and appears because the perturbed worldline is not ( except at special points ) coincident with the background worldline . in the limit @xmath451 \n , the body then moves on a family of geodesics of the background metric parameterized by @xmath2 , and the perturbative description of motion should indeed be the geodesic deviation equation . ] . \n the final term is the `` gravitational self - force '' , which is seen to take the form of a ( regularized ) gravitational force from the particle s own field . \n our derivation has thus provided a rigorous justification of the regularization schemes that have been proposed elsewhere . \n finally , we note that , although our analysis has many points of contact with previous analyses using matched asymptotic expansions , there are a number of significant differences . \n we have already noted in section [ sec : geodesic ] that our derivation of geodesic motion at zeroth order in @xmath2 appears to differ from some other derivations @xcite , which do not appear to impose the requirement that @xmath241 . \n we also have already noted that in other approaches to self - force @xcite , what corresponds to our scaled metric at @xmath38 is _ assumed _ to be of schwarzschild form . in these other approaches , first order perturbations in the near zone expansion \n are treated as time independent , and are required to be regular on the schwarzschild horizon . \n by contrast we make no assumptions about the time - dependence of the perturbations of the scaled metric beyond those that follow from our fundamental assumptions ( i)-(iii ) of section [ sec : example ] . \n thus , our first order perturbations are allowed to have linear dependence on @xmath156 , and our second order perturbations can depend quadratically on @xmath156 . \n we also make no assumptions about the spacetime at @xmath165 and therefore impose no boundary conditions at small @xmath72 . \n finally , there is a significant difference in the manner in which the gauge conditions used to define the motion are imposed . in @xcite , the entire @xmath424 electric parity part of what corresponds to our second order near zone perturbation \n is set to zero without proper justification electric parity perturbation that is relevant for obtaining equations of motion in @xcite is of `` acceleration type '' ( with linear growth in @xmath72 ) and does not have an obvious interpretation in terms of a shift in the center of mass . ] . \n by contrast , our `` no mass dipole '' condition applies to the _ background _ near - zone metric and has been justified as providing `` center of mass '' coordinates . \n as already mentioned near the beginning of section [ sec : dipole ] , the quantity @xmath29 in eq .   is a `` deviation vector '' defined on the background geodesic @xmath8 that describes the first order in @xmath2 perturbation to the motion . for any one parameter family of spacetimes \n @xmath42 satisfying the assumptions stated in section [ sec : example ] , eq . \n is therefore guaranteed to give a good approximation to the deviation from the background geodesic motion @xmath8 as @xmath35 . \n in other words , if @xmath8 is described by @xmath250 , then the new worldline obtained defined by @xmath452 is the correct description of motion to first order in @xmath2 ( when the metric perturbation is in lorenz gauge ) and is therefore guaranteed to be accurate at small @xmath2 . \n however , this guarantee is of the form that if one wants to describe the motion accurately up to time @xmath174 , then it always will be possible to choose @xmath2 sufficiently small that @xmath452 is a good approximation up to time @xmath174 . \n the guarantee is _ not _ of the form that if @xmath2 is chosen to be sufficiently small , then @xmath452 will accurately describe the motion for all time . \n indeed , for any fixed @xmath453 , it is to be expected that @xmath447 will grow large at sufficiently late times , and it is clear that the approximate description of motion @xmath452 can not be expected to be good when @xmath447 is large , since by the time the motion has deviated significantly from the original background geodesic @xmath8 , the motion clearly can not be accurately described in the framework of being a `` small correction '' to @xmath8 . however , the main intended application of the first order corrected equations of motion is to compute motion in cases , such as inspiral , where the deviations from the original geodesic motion become large at late times . \n it is therefore clear that eq . \n , as it stands , is useless for computing long term effects , such as inspiral . \n one possible response to the above difficulty would be to go to higher order in perturbation theory . however , it seems clear that this will not help . \n although the equations of motion obtained from @xmath454th order perturbation theory will be more accurate than the first order equations , they will not have a domain of validity that is significantly larger than the first order equations . \n the perturbative description at any finite order will continue to treat the motion as a `` small deviation '' from @xmath8 , and can not be expected to describe motion accurately when the deviations are , in fact , large . \n in essence , by the time that the deviation from @xmath8 has become sufficiently large to invalidate first order perturbation theory \n so that , e.g. , the second order corrections are comparable in magnitude to the first order corrections  then one would expect that the @xmath455th order corrections will also be comparable to the @xmath454th order corrections , so @xmath454th order perturbation theory will not be accurate either . only by going to all orders in perturbation theory \n can one expect to get an accurate , global in time , description of motion via perturbation theory . of course \n , if one goes to all orders in perturbation theory , then there is little point in having done perturbation theory at all . \n nevertheless , for a sufficiently small body of suffciently small mass , it seems clear that the corrections to geodesic motion should be _ locally _ small and should be locally described by eq .  . \n by the time these small corrections have built up and the body has deviated significantly from the original geodesic approximating its motion , it should then be close to a _ \n geodesic , perturbing off of which should give a better approximation to the motion for that portion of time . \n one could then attempt to `` patch together '' such solutions to construct a world - line that accurately describes the motion of the particle for a longer time . \n in the limit of many such patches with small times between them , one expects the resulting worldline to be described by a single `` self - consistent '' differential equation , which should then well - approximate the motion as long as it remains _ locally _ close to geodesic motion .    a simple , familiar example will help illustrate all of the above points . \n consider the cooling of a `` black body '' . to choose a definite problem that can be put in a framework similar to that considered in this paper , \n let us consider a body ( such as a lump of hot coal ) that is put in a box with perfect reflecting walls , but a hole of area @xmath456 is cut in the this wall . \n we are interested in determining how the energy , @xmath457 , of the body changes with time . at finite @xmath456 , \n this is a very difficult problem , since the body will not remain in exact thermal equilibrium as it radiates energy through the hole . \n however , let us consider a one - parameter family of cavities where @xmath458 smoothly goes to zero as @xmath35 . \n when @xmath82 , we find that the energy , @xmath459 , does not change with time , and the body will remain in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath460 for all time . when we do first order perturbation theory in @xmath2 , we will find that the first order in @xmath2 correction , @xmath461 , to the energy satisfies becomes small compared to the typical wavelengths of the radiation ( as it must as we let @xmath462 ) , we enter a physical optics regime where our formulas are no longer valid . \n we ignore such effects here , just as in our above analysis of the motion of bodies in general relativity we ignored quantum gravity effects even though they should be important when the size of the body is smaller than the planck scale . ] \n @xmath463 where @xmath464 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath465 . \n note that only the zeroth order temperature , @xmath460 , enters the right side of this equation because the quantity @xmath466 is already first order in @xmath2 , so the effect of any changes in temperature would appear only to higher order in @xmath2 . since @xmath460 is a constant , it is easy to integrate eq . \n ( [ de ] ) to obtain , @xmath467 thus , first order perturbation theory approximates the behavior of @xmath468 as @xmath469 although this is a good approximation at early times , it is a horrible approximation at late times , as it predicts that the energy will go negative . \n if one went to second order in perturbation theory , one would obtain corrections to eq . \n ( [ de ] ) that would take into account the first order energy loss as well as various non - equilibrium effects . however , one would still be perturbing off of the non - radiating background , and the late time predictions using second ( or any finite higher order ) perturbation theory would still be very poor . \n however , there is an obvious major improvement that can be obtained by noting that if @xmath456 is sufficiently small , then the body should remain nearly in thermal equilibrium as it loses energy . \n therefore , although perturbation theory off of the zeroth order solution may give poor results at late times , first order perturbation theory off of _ some _ thermal equilibrium solution should give locally accurate results at all times . \n this suggests that if @xmath456 is sufficiently small , the cooling of the body should be described by @xmath470 when supplemented with the formula , @xmath471 , that relates energy to temperature when the body is in thermal equilibrium , this equation should provide an excellent description of the cooling of the body that is valid at all times . in effect , eq . \n ( [ denew ] ) takes into account the higher order perturbative effects ( to all orders in @xmath2 ) associated with the cooling of the body , but it neglects various perturbative effects associated with the body failing to remain in thermal equilibrium as it cools . equation ( [ denew ] ) is _ not _ an exact equation ( since it does not take various non - equilibrium effects into account ) and it is _ not _ an equation that arises directly from perturbation theory . \n rather , it is an equation that corresponds to applying first order perturbation theory to a background that itself undergoes changes resulting from the perturbation . \n we will refer to such an equation as a `` self - consistent perturbative equation '' . \n such equations are commonly written down for systems that can be described _ locally in time _ by a small deviation from a simple solution . \n how does one find a `` self - consistent perturbative equation '' for a given system for which one has derived first order perturbative equations ? \n we do not believe that there is any general method for deriving a self - consistent perturbative equation . \n however , the following appear to be appropriate criteria to impose on a self - consistent perturbative equation : ( 1 ) it should have a well posed initial value formulation . \n ( 2 ) it should have the same number of degrees of freedom as the first order perturbative system , so that a correspondence can be made between initial data for the self - consistent perturbative equation and the first order perturbative system . \n ( 3 ) for corresponding initial data , the solutions to the self - consistent perturbative equation should be close to the corresponding solutions of the first order perturbative system over the time interval for which the first order perturbative description should be accurate . \n we do not know of any reason why , for any given system , there need exist a self - consistent perturbative equation satisfying these criteria . in cases \n where a self - consistent perturbative equation satisfying these criteria does exist , we would not expect it to be unique . \n for example , we could modify eq . \n ( [ denew ] ) by adding suitable terms proportional to @xmath472 to the right side of this equation . \n the first order perturbative equations for the motion of a small body are that the first order metric perturbation satisfies @xmath473 where @xmath116 corresponds to a geodesic , @xmath8 of the background spacetime , and @xmath7 is the tangent to @xmath8 . \n if we consider the retarded solution to this equation ( which automatically satisfies the lorenz gauge condition ) , we have proven rigorously in this paper that the first order in @xmath2 deviation of the motion from @xmath8 satisfies @xmath474 with @xmath475 where , for simplicity , we have dropped the spin term . \n the misataquwa equations \n @xmath476 @xmath477 @xmath20 ( where one chooses the retarded solution to eq . \n ( [ misa2 ] ) ) are an excellent candidate for self - consistent perturbative equations corresponding to the above first order perturbative system ) , since in the self - consistent perturbative equation , the deviation from the self - consistent worldline should vanish . ] . here \n , @xmath478 ( normalized in the background metric ) refers to the self - consistent motion @xmath479 , rather than to a background geodesic as before . \n although a proper mathematical analysis of this integro - differential system has not been carried out , it appears plausible that our above criteria ( 1)-(3 ) will be satisfied by the misataquwa equations . \n if so , they should provide a good , global in time , description of motion for problems like extreme mass ratio inspiral . \n we wish to thank abraham harte and eric poisson for helpful discussions . \n this research was supported in part by nsf grant phy04 - 56619 to the university of chicago and a national science foundation graduate research fellowship to sg . \n as discussed in section [ sec : dipole ] , the description of motion will change under first - order changes of gauge . \n indeed , in that section , we noted that under a smooth gauge transformation , the description of motion changes by eq . \n ( [ smoothgauge ] ) . however , as previously stated near the end of section [ sec : example ] above ( see equation ) , the allowed coordinate freedom includes transformations that are not smooth at @xmath50 . since such gauges may arise in practice singularity along a string @xcite , and therefore do not satisfy our assumptions . ] , we provide here the expression for the first order perturbative equation of motion in an arbitrary gauge allowed by our assumptions . \n we also present the corresponding self - consistent perturbative equations of motion .    as previously noted in section [ sec : calculation ] ( see the remark below eq . \n ( [ jh ] ) ) , the equations of motion to first order in @xmath2 depend only upon the first order gauge transformation @xmath480 . \n as we have seen , the mass dipole moment appears at second - order in ( far zone ) perturbation theory , so we must consider the effects of first - order gauge transformations on second - order perturbations . \n this is given by @xmath481 , with @xmath482 where @xmath483 denotes the lie derivative . \n equivalently , we have @xmath484 where @xmath191 is the derivative operator associated with the background metric @xmath171 . in order to satisfy the criteria on allowed gauge transformations ( see equation ) \n , the components of @xmath480 must be of the form @xmath485 i.e. , @xmath480 can not `` blow up '' at @xmath50 but it can be singular in the sense that its components can have direction - dependent limits . \n the mass dipole moment , @xmath373 , is one - half of the coefficient of the @xmath383 part of the leading order , @xmath310 , part of the second order metric perturbation , @xmath486 . \n therefore , @xmath373 may be extracted from the formula , @xmath487 where ds is the area element on the sphere of radius @xmath488 . under the gauge transformation generated by @xmath480 \n , we have @xmath489 as previously noted , for an arbitrary first - order perturbation satisfying our assumptions , we have @xmath490 where @xmath32 is the mass of the body . from eqs . \n ( [ xiform ] ) , ( [ dg200 ] ) and ( [ g100 ] ) , we see that the change in @xmath486 induced by our gauge transformation is @xmath491 therefore , by eq . \n ( [ eq : app - dip ] ) , the induced change in the mass dipole moment is @xmath492 where @xmath493 is the area element on the unit sphere .    equation ( [ dp ] ) gives the change in the mass dipole moment induced by the possibly non - smooth gauge transformation generated by @xmath480 . \n the corresponding change in the first order perturbative equation of motion is determined by the change in the _ smooth _ vector field @xmath494 required to eliminate the mass dipole . \n writing @xmath495 , this change is given by @xmath496 ( see eq . ) . \n thus , the change @xmath497 induced in the deviation vector describing the perturbed worldline is @xmath498 with @xmath499 given by eq .  . \n in the case where our original gauge was the lorenz gauge , it follows immediately from eq . \n ( [ eq : eom ] ) that the new equation of motion for @xmath500 is @xmath501 where @xmath502 is given by eq . \n ( [ eq : gauge - law ] ) , and where , for simplicity , we have dropped the spin term . \n we may rewrite eq . \n ( [ eq : eom - app2 ] ) as @xmath503 note that although eq . \n ( [ eq : eom - app6 ] ) provides us with the desired equation of motion in an arbitrary allowed gauge , the terms involving components of @xmath504 must still be computed in the lorenz gauge . \n now suppose one wishes to pass to a self - consistent perturbative equation associated with the new choice of gauge . \n it is not obvious how one might wish to modify the evolution equations for the metric perturbations in the new gauge . \n ( one possibility would be to simply use eq . \n ( [ misa2 ] ) and then modify the result by the addition of @xmath505 but it might be preferable to find a new equation based on a suitable `` relaxed '' version of the linearized einstein equation for the new gauge . ) \n however , it appears that a natural choice of self - consistent perturbative equation associated to eq . \n ( [ eq : eom - app6 ] ) would be @xmath506 in the case where @xmath480 is smooth ( so that , by eq .  ( \n [ eq : gauge - law ] ) , we have @xmath507 ) this agrees with the proposal of barack and ori @xcite . \n wald 1984 _ general relativity _ \n ( chicago , il : university of chicago press ) r. geroch and j. traschen , _ phys . rev . \n d _ * 36 * , 1017 ( 1987 ) s. weinberg 1972 _ gravitation and cosmology _ \n ( new york : wiley ) w. israel , _ \n nuovo cim . \n b _ * 44 * 1 ( 1966 ) y. mino , m. sasaki , and t. tanaka , _ phys \n d _ , * 55 * , 3457 - 3476 , ( 1997 ) t.c . \n quinn and r.m . \n wald , _ phys . \n d _ , * 56 * , 3381 - 3394 , ( 1997 ) s. detweiler and b.f . \n whiting , _ phys . \n * 67 * , 024025 , ( 2003 ) e. poisson , _ liv . \n rel . _ * 7 * 6 ( 2004 ) b.s . \n dewitt and r.w . \n brehme , _ ann . \n _ , * 9 * , 220 - 259 , ( 1960 ) p. a. m. dirac , _ proc . \n lond . a _ * 167 * 148 ( 1938 ) w. l. burke , _ j. math . \n ( n.y . ) * 12 * , 401 ( 1971 ) p. d. death , _ phys . \n d _ * 11 * 1387 ( 1975 ) r. kates , _ phys . \n * 22 * 1853 ( 1980 ) k. s. thorne and j. b. hartle , _ phys . \n d _ * 31 * 1815 ( 1985 ) r. geroch and p.s . \n * 16 * ( 1975 ) , pp . 65 - 67 j. ehlers and r. geroch , _ ann . \n phys . _ * 309 * , 232 ( 2004 ) d.a.m . \n stuart , _ j. math . \n pures appl . \n _ * 83 * , 541 ( 2004 ) a. papapetrou , _ proc . \n . london _ * a209 * , pp . \n 248 - 258 ( 1951 ) l. barack and a. ori , _ phys . \n d _ , * 64 * , 124003 , 1 - 13 , ( 2001 ) s. gralla , a. harte , and r. wald , in preparation r. geroch , _ commun . \n * 13 * 180 ( 1969 ) t. futamase and y. itoh , _ living rev \n . relativity _ * 10 * , 2 ( 2007 ) r.m . \n wald , _ phys . \n lett . _ * 41 * 203 ( 1978 ) w. beiglbock , _ commun . \n _ * 5 * , 106 ( 1967 ) r. geroch , _ j. math \n * 11 * 2580 ( 1970 ) r. o. hansen , _ j. math \n . phys . _ * 15 * 46 ( 1974 ) r. beig and w. simon , _ gen . \n * 12 * 1003 ( 1980 ) p. kundu , _ \n _ , 22 , 1236 ( 1981 ) x.h . \n zhang , _ phys . \n d _ * 34 * 991 ( 1986 ) k. s. thorne , _ rev . \n _ _ 52 _ 299 ( 1980 ) l. blanchet and t. damour , _ philos . \n . london _ * a320 * , 379 ( 1986 )",
        "abstract": "The article explores the rigorous derivation of the Misataquwa equations, which describe the motion of small bodies in general relativity while accounting for gravitational self-force and spin-curvature coupling effects. It critiques prior derivations for their reliance on unjustified assumptions like 'Lorenz gauge relaxation' and presents a systematic framework using a one-parameter family of metrics to scale down bodies to point-like limits. The study proves that such bodies move along geodesics of the background spacetime at zeroth order and introduces corrections as first-order perturbations, offering a foundation for further higher-order corrections."

        "article": "laser - cooling @xcite allows to cool ions and atoms to very low temperatures . for this purpose \n , the full knowledge of the effects of the various physical parameters determining the cooling process is very important . among the various schemes , \n raman sideband cooling has been demonstrated to be a very successful technique for preparing atoms in the ground state of a harmonic potential @xcite . \n this cooling method exploits two stable or metastable atomic internal levels , which we call @xmath0 and @xmath1 , connected by dipole transitions to a common excited state @xmath2 . the transitions are usually driven by alternating pulses . a typical sequence alternates a coherent pulse , \n in which the atom is coherently transferred from @xmath0 to @xmath1 via a properly designed raman pulse , with a re - pumping pulse , in which the atom is incoherently re - scattered to @xmath0 by means of a laser resonant with @xmath3 . \n a change of the motional state during the repumping is a process of higher order in the ratio @xmath4 of the recoil frequency @xmath5 and the trap frequency @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the mass of the atom and @xmath8 the wave vector of the one - photon transition . in the lamb - dicke regime , where @xmath9 , the probability for a change of the motional state is negligible and therefore , on the average , the system is cooled at a rate of one phonon of energy @xmath10 per cooling cycle . since there is a finite probability for the atom to be returned to the state @xmath1 instead of being repumped , a number of incoherent scattering events may be required before the atom is finally scattered into @xmath0 , which significantly increases the motional energy at the end of the optical pumping , reducing the cooling efficiency . \n furthermore , since two and three level schemes are realized using zeeman or hyperfine substates , decays from @xmath2 into other electronic substates can occur , leading to additional heating . \n + in this work we quantify the effect of a finite branching ratio in pulsed raman sideband cooling by calculating the average shift and diffusion of the vibrational energy distribution at the end of an incoherent pumping pulse . \n it should be pointed out that theoretical studies on laser - cooling for multilevel ions exist , which systematically include the branching ratio in their treatments @xcite . \n those studies have focussed on the lamb - dicke regime and on certain cooling schemes . here \n , we single out the effect of the branching ratio on cooling for an arbitrary ratio @xmath4 by applying sum rules . \n hence , we infer the cooling efficiency in the lamb - dicke regime and we discuss the result outside the lamb - dicke regime in connection with the proposal in @xcite . in particular , \n we show that in some parameter ranges the average effect of the multiple photon scattering can be described with an effective wave vector @xmath11 for the `` effective '' two - level transition @xmath12 @xcite . + \n this article is organized as follows . in section 2 \n we introduce the model for the evolution of a trapped ion during the repumping pulse in a raman transition , and we evaluate the average shift and variance of the ion energy at the end of the pulse . in section 3 \n we extend our analysis to cases where the channels of decay are multiple . in section 4 \n we draw some conclusions , and in the appendix we report the details of our calculations . \n we consider a three level atom as in fig . [ \n fig : scheme0 ] , whose internal levels are a ground state @xmath13 , stable or metastable state @xmath14 and excited state @xmath15 of radiative width @xmath16 ; @xmath17 , @xmath18 are dipole transitions , with respective probabilities of decay @xmath19 , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 . \n a laser resonantly drives the transition @xmath18 with rabi frequency @xmath22 . in the following \n we assume the wave vectors for both transitions to be equal to @xmath8 , which is a good approximation if , e.g. , @xmath14 and @xmath13 are hyperfine components of the ground state . \n we study the ion motion in one - dimension . + \n the master equation for the atomic density matrix @xmath23 is written as ( @xmath24 ) :    @xmath25+l\\rho_3 , \\label{master0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 has the form :    @xmath27    here , @xmath28 is the detuning of the laser on the @xmath29 transition , which we take to be zero , and @xmath6 is the frequency of the harmonic oscillator which traps the ion along the @xmath30-direction , with @xmath31 annihilation and creation operator , respectively . \n the interaction of the ion with the laser light is described in the dipole approximation by the operator @xmath32 :    @xmath33    with @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 ) dipole raising operator , @xmath36 its adjoint , and @xmath30 the position of the atom . in writing ( [ coherent1 ] ) , ( [ master0 ] ) \n we have applied the rotating wave approximation and we have moved to the inertial frame rotating at the laser frequency . finally , the relaxation super  operator has the form    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the dipole pattern of the spontaneous emission , which we take @xmath39 . \n + in the limit @xmath40 we can eliminate the excited state @xmath2 in second order perturbation theory @xcite , and reduce the three - level scheme to a two level one , with excited state @xmath14 and linewidth @xmath41 @xcite . in the limit @xmath42 the master equation for the density matrix @xmath43 , projection of @xmath23 on the subspace @xmath44 , \n can be rewritten as @xcite :    @xmath45+\\gamma_e\\left[j_e\\rho + j_g\\rho\\right ] , \\label{master1}\\ ] ]    with @xmath46 effective hamiltonian    @xmath47 , @xmath48 jump operators , defined as :      where @xmath50 and where    @xmath51    the solution of eq . \n ( [ master1 ] ) can be written as follows @xcite :    @xmath52    with @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the propagator for the effective hamiltonian :    @xmath55    in eq . \n ( [ sol ] ) the successive contributions to the multiple scattering event are singled out : the first term on the rhs corresponds to the case in which at time @xmath56 no spontaneous decay has occurred . the second term describes a single scattering event , and the @xmath57-th term @xmath58 scattering events . \n the trace of each term corresponds to the probability associated with each event , and we can thus interpret eq . \n ( [ sol ] ) as the sum over all the possible paths of the scattering event weighted by their respective probabilities . at @xmath59 , @xmath60 , \n the atom is in @xmath0 and @xmath61 . for a pulse of duration @xmath62 we \n can replace @xmath56 by @xmath63 in the integrals of eq . \n ( [ sol ] ) and assume that the atom has been scattered into @xmath0 at the end of the pulse . \n now , each term on the rhs of eq . \n ( [ sol ] ) corresponds to the path associated with a certain number of scattering events into @xmath1 before the atom is finally scattered into @xmath0 . through ( [ sol ] ) \n we can evaluate the shift and the variance of the energy distribution at the end of the repumping pulse , which are defined as :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the initial motional energy of the atom .      for simplifying the form of the discussion presented below , we rewrite the operator @xmath67 as follows :    @xmath68    where @xmath69 , @xmath70 are defined as :    @xmath71|l\\rangle\\langle l|,&\\\\ & \\hat{j}\\rho=\\sum_l\\sum_{l_1,l_1\\neq l }      and where @xmath72 is the basis of eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator . for @xmath73 , with @xmath74 initial distribution over the motional states , and according to eq . \n ( [ sol ] ) the steady state distribution has the form :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the final distribution over the motional states . \n the first term in the rhs of ( [ sol1 ] ) is the sum over all paths from @xmath1 into @xmath0 , where after each jump the density operator is diagonal in the basis @xmath72 , whereas the second term contains all other paths . \n these latter terms can be neglected @xcite , and for @xmath77 the following relation holds :    @xmath78|s\\rangle = d_n(s ) . \n \\label{distri}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath79 is the probability for the atom to be found in the state @xmath80 at @xmath59 , given the initial state @xmath81 at @xmath82 . using the explicit form ( [ tilde ] ) of @xmath69 in ( [ distri ] ) , @xmath79 has the form :    @xmath83    where we have used the relation @xmath84 , with @xmath85 size of the ground state of the harmonic oscillator . substituting ( [ explicit ] ) into eqs . \n ( [ shift0 ] ) , ( [ diff0 ] ) , and applying the commutation properties of @xmath31 [ see the appendix ] , we find :    @xmath86 , \\label{width1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath87 is the lamb - dicke parameter .      equation ( [ center1 ] ) represents the average shift to the vibrational energy at the end of the repumping pulse . for @xmath88 \n it corresponds to the average recoil energy @xmath89 associated with one incoherent raman scattering into @xmath0 . in this case , the second term in the rhs of eq . \n ( [ width1 ] ) vanishes , and eqs . \n ( [ center1 ] ) , ( [ width1 ] ) describe the scattering of one photon of wave vector @xmath90 on the effective two - level transition @xmath91 . \n similarly for @xmath92 an effective wave vector @xmath11 can be defined for the incoherent scattering on the two - level transition @xmath91 , which has the form    @xmath93    thus , @xmath94 describes the average mechanical effect on the ion resulting from the multiple scattering of photons during the repumping pulse in a raman transition with branching ratio @xmath95 : this description is valid in the limit in which we may neglect the second term in the rhs of ( [ width1 ] ) , _ i.e. _ for @xmath20 and/or @xmath96 sufficiently small . in fig . \n 2 the first term of rhs of eq . \n ( [ width1 ] ) is compared with the complete expression for @xmath97 , for different values of the lamb - dicke parameter and as a function of @xmath20 . here \n , we see that @xmath11 characterizes the scattering process for almost any branching ratio in the lamb - dicke regime , whereas for @xmath98 an appreciable difference is already visible at @xmath99 . + from ( [ eta_eff ] ) \n we can define the effective lamb - dicke parameter @xmath100 describing an incoherent scattering into the state @xmath0 . \n this parameter provides an immediate estimate of the effect of the branching ratio on cooling . for @xmath101 , if @xmath102 the system is still in the lamb - dicke regime once it has been finally scattered into @xmath0 . \n furthermore , the coarse - grained dynamics of the system can be described by a rate equation for the motional states @xmath103 projected onto @xmath0 , where the rate of cooling ( heating ) is the real part of the sum of two terms : one corresponding to the component of the fluctuation spectrum of the dipole force at frequency @xmath6 ( @xmath104 ) , the other to the diffusion coefficient due to spontaneous emission from the excited state @xcite . \n this latter term is proportional to the squared lamb - dicke parameter for the incoherent scattering , and thus in our case to @xmath105 . from the well - known solution of the rate equation @xcite , \n the diffusion term affects the steady state average vibrational number @xmath106 , which is proportional to the diffusion coefficient . + outside the lamb - dicke regime , when @xmath107 is comparable to , or larger than , @xmath6 , there are no estabilished ground - state laser - cooling techniques for trapped atoms . here \n , we discuss our result in connection to the proposal in @xcite . there , a cooling scheme similar to raman sideband cooling has been presented , where pulses which pump the atoms to the ground state alternate with pulses confining the atoms to a limited region of motional energy . \n these confinement pulses have two - photon detuning @xmath108 to the red of the two - photon resonance frequency , where @xmath109 . \n then , the presence of a branching ratio must be taken into account by choosing @xmath110 . in this regime , \n pulses which efficiently counteract the average kick @xmath111 can be designed , provided that the following condition is fulfilled :    @xmath112    where @xmath113 is the projection on @xmath30 of the two - photon wave vector of the coherent pulse . for two counterpropagating beams parallel to @xmath30 , @xmath114 and ( [ valid ] ) \n is fulfilled for @xmath115 , i.e. up to branching ratios @xmath116 . finally , outside the lamb - dicke regime the second term in the rhs of eq . \n ( [ width1 ] ) can not be neglected . \n hence , the diffusion is larger , and the efficiency of cooling may decrease dramatically as @xmath20 increases . \n in the following , we show that the average heating associated with the repumping pulse in multilevel - schemes can be described in the same way as discussed in the previous sections . \n + let us consider the level - scheme of fig . \n 3(a ) , where we have added to the scheme of fig . \n 1 a further channel of decay from @xmath2 into the stable or metastable state @xmath117 , with probability of decay @xmath118 such that @xmath119 , where @xmath120 , @xmath121 are the probability of decay onto @xmath122 , respectively . \n a laser resonantly drives the transition @xmath123 with rabi frequency @xmath124 . for @xmath125 \n the state @xmath2 can be adiabatically eliminated from the equations of motion . in this limit \n the master equation aquires the form    @xmath126\\\\ & & + p_e'\\gamma^{\\prime}j_e\\rho + p_1\\gamma^{\\prime}j_1\\rho + p_g'\\gamma^{\\prime}j_g\\rho,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath127 , with @xmath128 . \n the effective hamiltonian is now :    @xmath129    with @xmath130 . \n the solution at @xmath59 can be written as :    @xmath131    hence , the shift and variance have the form evaluated in eqs . \n ( [ center1 ] ) , ( [ width1 ] ) where now the probability @xmath19 , @xmath20 are defined as @xmath132 , @xmath133 ( @xmath21 ) . in a similar way we have evaluated these quantities for schemes like the one shown in fig . \n 3(b ) , where a second excited state @xmath134 is coupled to @xmath1 via the same recycling laser tuned on the transition @xmath135 . for simplifying the treatment , \n we assume that a fourth laser resonantly drives the transition @xmath136 with rabi frequency @xmath137 ( grey arrow in fig . \n 3(b ) ) . thus , for low saturation eq . \n ( [ mastermany ] ) describes the dynamics , where now @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) , with @xmath140 being the rate of scattering through the excited state @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) . assuming that @xmath137 is such that @xmath143 , the solution in eqs . \n ( [ center1 ] ) , ( [ width1 ] ) applies to this case too , where now @xmath20 is defined as :    @xmath144    and the probability @xmath19 of decaying into @xmath0 is @xmath145 . \n + the result ( [ result_prob ] ) shows that the total heating is minimum for @xmath146 , which can be obtained by choosing properly the laser intensity of the repumping lasers , or simply by removing degeneracies in the zeeman multiplet , for example with the help of a magnetic field . \n we have studied the motional heating associated with a finite branching ratio and in the presence of multiple decay and excitation channels at the end of a repumping pulse in raman sideband cooling . \n the first and second moments of the final energy distribution has been evaluated analytically , and the effect of the branching ratio has been singled out . \n we have shown that in a certain range of parameters the diffusion can be described with an effective wave vector @xmath11 , corresponding to an effective lamb \n dicke parameter @xmath147 for the incoherent scattering on the two - level transition @xmath12 . \n finally , on the basis of this result we have discussed the efficiency of raman sideband cooling and of a recent proposal of ground - state cooling outside the lamb - dicke regime @xcite . + \n analogous sum rules and considerations can be applied to raman cooling for free atoms @xcite . in that case \n the calculations are much simpler , since the total momentum of radiation and atom is a conserved quantity in the scattering event . \n + in general , these results can be applied to cooling schemes in multilevel atoms . \n the authors acknowledge many stimulating discussions with s. khler and v. ludsteck . g.m . \n thanks j.i . \n cirac , j. eschner and p. lambropoulos for many stimulating discussions . \n this work is supported in parts by the european commission within the tmr -

        "abstract": "This study explores pulsed Raman sideband cooling in the presence of multiple decay and excitation channels, focusing on heating effects during optical pumping. By applying sum rules, the researchers describe photon scattering with an effective wave vector, analyzing efficiency both inside and outside the Lamb-Dicke regime.

        "article": "infrared spectroscopy provides a crucial means in the identification of interstellar dust compositions . \n recent infrared satellite observations by the _ infrared telescope in space _ ( _ irts _ ; * ? ? ? \n * ) and the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ; * ? ? ? \n * ) have revealed several new dust features in the diffuse emission , indicating the presence of new dust components in the interstellar medium @xcite . \n observations by _ iso _ also clearly show the presence of crystalline silicates around young and evolved stars for the first time @xcite , while it is not yet certain whether crystalline silicates exist commonly in interstellar space .    in the present paper \n we report the observations of active star - forming regions , the carina nebula and the sharpless 171 ( s171 ) region with the long - wavelength spectrometer ( lws ; * ? ? ? \n * ) on board _ iso _ and the detection of far - infrared features around 65@xmath0 m and 100@xmath0 m in the diffuse emission . \n the carina nebula is one of the most active regions on the galactic plane and known to contain a number of early - type stars @xcite . \n the s171 region is a typical region and molecular cloud complex @xcite . \n both regions are supposed to represent the characteristics of active regions in the galaxy . \n possible carriers of the two detected features are discussed and we investigate the possibility that carbon onion grains of curved graphitic shells are the carrier for the broad interstellar 100@xmath0 m feature . \n the central @xmath1 portion of the carina nebula was observed by two - dimensional raster scans with the lws full grating scan mode and the far - infrared spectra for 43197@xmath0 m were obtained for 132 positions ( for details of the observations , see * ? ? ? \n a one - dimensional scan was made for 24 positions on a line from the heating source to the molecular cloud region in s171 with the same lws observing mode @xcite . \n the observed area of the both objects includes ionized regions and molecular clouds and the spectra sample the diffuse emission from the interstellar matter rather than the emission from point - like sources . \n the off - line processing data of version 10.1 ( olp 10.1 ) provided by the iso archival data center were used in the present study . \n the spectra were defringed , converted into the surface brightness , and the extended source correction was applied by the iso spectral analysis package ( isap ) software . \n the beam size and the correction factors were taken from the latest lws handbook @xcite \n . there are gaps in the spectra between the detector channels , which can be ascribed to the uncertainties either in the responsivity , in the dark current , or in the spatial brightness distribution in the beam . \n figure  [ fig1 ] shows examples of the obtained original spectra of the two regions , while figure  [ fig2 ] indicates their stitched spectra to correct the gaps . \n both spectra were taken at the interface regions between the molecular cloud and ionized gas , where the far - infrared intensity is sufficiently large to investigate dust features . \n the stitched spectra are made by scaling each detector signal because the observed regions are bright enough that the uncertainty in the dark current should be less significant than those in the responsivity or in the spatial brightness distribution . as can be seen in figure  [ fig1 ] , \n the amount of the gaps is small ( @xmath2 5% ) except for the three longest channels ( @xmath3@xmath0 m ) , where 1020% scaling is necessary to correct the gaps . \n the presence of a relatively narrow band feature at 65@xmath0 m is seen even in the unstitched spectra , particularly in s171 . in the spectrum of the carina nebula \n , the appearance of this feature is slightly disturbed by the higher levels of the adjacent channel spectra ( sw2 and sw4 ) relative to the level of the sw3 channel , but it can still be seen in the individual spectrum of the sw3 channel . a broad feature centered around 100@xmath0 m is also noticeable in the unstitched spectrum of s171 . \n the slope of the continuum starts to become flatter around the boundary between the sw4 and sw5 channels , indicating a feature starting around 80@xmath0 m . in the unstitched spectrum of the carina nebula , \n the gap between the sw4 and sw5 channels makes the feature less obvious , but the change in the slope in the sw5 channel can still be seen . \n the stitched spectrum clearly indicates the presence of the feature . \n however there is no appreciable abrupt change in the slope at longer wavelengths and the longer wavelength end of the feature is difficult to estimate from these spectra . \n neither spurious features have been reported nor the relative spectral response functions have the corresponding features in these spectral ranges @xcite . \n we will discuss possible underlying continua to confirm the presence of the feature and estimate the feature profile in next section . \n similar features are seen at about a half of the observed positions both in the carina and s171 regions . \n since these features are seen in a wide area of the interstellar medium , the band carriers must be ubiquitous species in interstellar space . \n @xcite reported the presence of 65@xmath0 m and 90@xmath0 \n m features in the spectra of evolved stars . \n figure  [ fig3]a shows a spectrum of ngc6302 taken from the iso archival data center for comparison ( cf . * ? ? ? \n the continuum emission indicates a much higher temperature than those in figure  [ fig2 ] and the features are weakly seen on the steep continuum . to see the features more clearly , \n the flux is multiplied by the square of the wavelength ( @xmath4 ) and plotted in figure  [ fig3]b . \n the interstellar 65@xmath0 m feature seems very similar to that detected in evolved stars . \n the peak of the 65@xmath0 m feature is located obviously longer than [ ] 63@xmath0 m line ( fig . \n [ fig4 ] ; see also fig . \n [ fig6 ] ) and thus is not compatible with the crystalline ice band at 62@xmath0 m @xcite . \n @xcite have proposed a ca - bearing crystalline silicate , diopside ( camgsi@xmath5o@xmath6 ) , as a possible carrier of the 65@xmath0 m feature in evolved stars . \n cryogenic measurements of the optical properties of diopside support the identification @xcite . \n figure  [ fig4 ] shows a comparison of the observed spectra with the laboratory data . \n the best fit continua described in next subsection are also plotted . \n the laboratory spectrum shows a narrower profile than those observed and other species , such as water ice and dolomite ( camg(co@xmath7)@xmath5 ) , have been suggested to contribute also to the 65@xmath0 m band emission @xcite . \n diopside has a weak feature also at 44.5@xmath0 m . \n the lws detector in this spectral range ( sw1 ) is less sensitive and known to have strong hysteresis . in the present spectra a band feature is seen around 45@xmath0 m both in the upward and downward scans of both spectra , suggesting the presence of the 45@xmath0 m feature . \n however large noises in this spectral range preclude the firm detection and further observations are needed to confirm the feature . \n band features of other crystalline minerals , such as the 69@xmath0 m band of forsterite seen in ngc6302 , are not seen in the present lws spectra . \n diopside also has strong features in 3040@xmath0 m . \n the carina nebula was observed by short - wavelength spectrometer ( sws ; * ? ? ? \n * ) and the spectra of 2.345@xmath0 m have been obtained . \n however the sws spectra were not taken at the same positions as the lws spectrum and thus the direct examination is difficult . \n the sws spectra are dominated by strong continuum and do not clearly show any solid bands except for the broad 22@xmath0 m feature @xcite . \n if the identification of the interstellar 65@xmath0 m with diopside is correct , this is the first detection of a crystalline silicate in the diffuse interstellar medium . \n efficient destruction of dust grains by interstellar shocks suggests that a large fraction of interstellar dust must be formed in interstellar space in addition to those supplied from stars @xcite . \n diopside is a high - temperature condensate and may survive harsh conditions . \n calcium is a less abundant element than magnesium or silicon , but it is highly depleted in the gas phase of the interstellar medium @xcite \n . therefore the presence of ca - containing dust should not be surprising in interstellar space . \n based on the measured band strength of diopside @xcite and the observed strength relative to the continuum , we roughly estimate that 510% of solar abundance calcium in diopside grains is sufficient to account for the observed band emission if we take the commonly used mass absorption coefficient of 50 @xmath8g@xmath9 for the continuum emission at 100@xmath0 m @xcite . @xcite \n have suggested that the crystallinity of the silicates is less than 12% in the interstellar medium based on the observations of protostars .      since the feature seen around 100@xmath0 m \n is quite broad and weak , we investigate several cases for the underlying continuum to examine the presence of the broad 100@xmath0 m feature in detail and to make a rough estimate of the 100@xmath0 m feature profile . in the estimate of the continuum \n we assume the baseline positions to be at 5560@xmath0 m , 7080@xmath0 m , and 140190@xmath0 m or 120190@xmath0 m ( see below ) and we try to fit the observed spectra in these ranges with the model continuum as much as possible . \n because the shortest spectral range ( 5560@xmath0 m ) has higher noises , less weight is put on this range in the fitting . \n we first adopt the dust model with the power - law emissivity ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a constant ) for the continuum emission . \n we found that the single - temperature graybody model can not fit the entire baseline positions satisfactorily . \n particularly the model always gives a higher flux at long wavelengths than the observed spectra . \n this discrepancy can not be solved by increasing @xmath11 because then the model would provide unnecessarily large fluxes at shorter wavelengths . introducing a second component with a low temperature \n improves the fit drastically . \n the model of @xmath12 both for warm and cold grains gives reasonable fits , but still has slightly larger fluxes at longest wavelengths ( @xmath13@xmath0 m ) than the observed spectra . \n increase of @xmath11 from 2 to unrealistically large 3 for the cold grains does not improve the fit appreciably . \n the power - law emissivity model has a spectral dependence of @xmath14 in the rayleigh - jeans regime . \n the discrepancy in the fit at longest wavelengths comes from the fact that the observed spectra have a gradually changing power - law index . \n the brightness distribution within the lws beam affects the global shape of the spectrum . \n as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] the unstitched spectra have relatively large gaps in longer wavelengths ( @xmath15@xmath0 m ) , suggesting an uncertainty associated with the slope in this spectral range . \n it also suggests a difficulty in defining the assumed baseline in the longer wavelengths . in the following we present two cases for the baseline ; one with 140190@xmath0 m ( case a ) and 120190@xmath0 m ( case b ) to examine the effect of the assumed baseline and as a more realistic model we examine the astronomical silicate and graphite grain model @xcite \n the silicate and graphite grains both have approximately a power - law emissivity of @xmath16 in the far - infrared and this model provides slightly better fits than the power - law emissivity model of @xmath17 . \n we present the results of the silicate - graphite model in the following . \n we assume different single temperatures for each of the astronomical silicate and graphite grains and search for the best fit temperatures . \n the observed regions may contain various temperature components of various dust grains and thus these fits are a simple approximation for the underlying continuum . in figure  [ fig2 ] \n the best fit results are plotted together with the observed spectra . \n the dotted lines indicate the results for the case a baseline , which fit the observed spectra reasonably well even in the longest wavelengths . \n they overlap mostly with the observed spectra for @xmath18@xmath0 m in the plot . \n the dashed lines show those for the case b baseline , which have obviously higher fluxes at longest wavelengths ( @xmath13@xmath0 m ) than the observed spectra . \n both cases clearly indicate the presence of an excess feature starting around 80@xmath0 m . \n the slope change around 80@xmath0 m is steep and can not be accounted for by extra graybodies . \n the similarity of the excess profile in two different regions supports the presence of the feature and suggests the common origin . \n @xcite have attributed the 90@xmath0 m feature in evolved stars to calcite ( caco@xmath7 ) , a carbonate mineral . in figure \n [ fig3]b we also plot a single - temperature graybody as a simple reference continuum . \n comparison with figure  [ fig2 ] indicates that the 90@xmath0 m feature in ngc6302 is narrower than the interstellar 100@xmath0 m feature . \n the spectrum of ngc6302 shows a clear slope change around 100@xmath0 m , which indicates the longer wavelength edge of the feature . \n in contrast , the interstellar spectra do not show the clear change in the slope and suggest that the feature is extended to longer wavelengths than the 90@xmath0 m feature . \n the longer wavelength edge of the interstellar feature can not be well determined . \n although the exact peak position and width of the feature depend on the assumed continuum and the location of the baseline , the interstellar 100@xmath0 m feature seems to be shifted to longer wavelengths and have a wider width than the 90@xmath0 m feature seen in evolved stars . \n while carbonate grains are a likely candidate for the 90@xmath0 m emission around evolved stars and may partly contribute to the interstellar 100@xmath0 m feature , we examine the possibility of alternative species which has a broad feature around 100@xmath0 m for the band carrier in the diffuse emission . in the following we investigate whether carbon onion grains consisting of concentric curved graphitic sheets @xcite can account for the observed broad 100@xmath0 m feature or not . \n graphite is an anisotropic material and has different optical properties in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the c - axis ( the c - axis is perpendicular to the graphitic plane ) . \n it has an interband transition around 80@xmath0 m in the direction perpendicular to the c - axis @xcite . \n the emission efficiency of graphite spheres can be calculated by the so - called \n approximation @xcite , in which the efficiencies in the perpendicular and parallel to the c - axis are averaged with the weight of and , respectively . \n this approximation is valid in the small particle limit if the sphere consists of layered graphitic sheets and the optical properties in both directions are independent . in the graphite sphere , \n the emission efficiency in the direction parallel to the c - axis is much larger than that in the direction perpendicular to the axis in the far - infrared region . \n therefore the interband transition feature mentioned above is not visible in the averaged efficiency @xcite .    in carbon onions , on the other hand , the graphitic layer is curved and approximately constitutes closed shells . \n thus the optical properties in the both directions should be mutually coupled and the interband feature can become visible in the emission efficiency of carbon onion grains . figure  [ fig5 ] shows the emission efficiency factors divided by the grain radius for a graphite sphere and a carbon onion grain under the assumption that the grain radius is much smaller than the wavelengths in question . here \n the dielectric constants of graphite in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the c - axis at room temperature measurements are adopted in the calculations ( * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * see below for discussion ) . \n the efficiency for the carbon onion is calculated by the formulation by henrard et al . \n ( 1993 ) and is assumed to have a central cavity of 0.7 in radius relative to the particle size . \n the appearance of the feature is insensitive to the size of the cavity . \n a broad feature around 100@xmath0 m is seen in the emission efficiency of the graphite sphere in the direction perpendicular to the c - axis , but it is hardly seen in the averaged efficiency . on the other hand , \n the far - infrared feature is evident in the emission efficiency of carbon onion particles . \n figure  [ fig6 ] shows a comparison of the observed feature with that of carbon onion grains . to make the comparison easy the observed spectra \n are divided by the assumed continuum , while the efficiency of the carbon onion is divided by @xmath19 . \n two lines in the upper two panels indicate the effect of the assumed continuum . \n carbon onion grains show a similar broad feature to that observed in the diffuse interstellar emission , but details of the profile do not match perfectly . taking account of the uncertainties in the shape of the underlying continuum and the optical properties of carbon onions ( see below ) , the similarity of the band feature suggests that carbon onions are a possible carrier of the interstellar 100@xmath0 m feature . \n the 100@xmath0 m feature of carbon onions results from the surface resonance of small particles @xcite and appears near the wavelength where the real part of the dielectric constants in the perpendicular direction just becomes below zero . \n the exact position and profile of the feature thus depend on the adopted dielectric constants . \n while the electronic structure of carbon onions has been suggested to not differ significantly from that of graphite @xcite , the contribution of free electrons , which dominates in the far - infrared regions , may be different . \n in fact , measurements of electron spin resonance and electron energy - loss spectroscopy suggest that @xmath20 electrons in carbon onions are mostly localized in small domains @xcite \n . the localization of @xmath20 electron will decrease the contribution of free electrons , shifting the surface mode to wavelengths longer than 100@xmath0 m . \n we surmise that the shift can be more than 10@xmath0 m . \n but it is difficult to estimate the possible range of the shift because the behavior of free electrons depends also on the temperature and the strength of the interband transition in carbon onions could also be affected by the localization . \n the @xmath20 electron localization , the temperature dependence , and the possible change in the interband transition strength should affect the optical properties of carbon onions in the far - infrared . \n the match seen in figure  [ fig6 ] may be just a coincidence in this sense . \n the present calculation suggests that the observed band feature can be accounted for if carbon onion grains contribute to 2030% of the far - infrared emission . \n carbon is an abundant element , but the exact form of carbon dust in the interstellar medium is not yet clear ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n carbon onions are a likely form other than graphite or amorphous carbon in addition to small aromatic particles or large molecules whose presence has been confirmed by the infrared emission bands in the diffuse interstellar radiation @xcite . \n carbon onions have recently attracted attentions as a new form of carbon material following the discovery of fullerens and their family . in astronomy , they are suggested to be formed in interstellar processes @xcite and the harsh conditions accompanying interstellar dust formation are favorable for the formation of onions @xcite . \n they have been proposed as a likely candidate for the interstellar 220 nm extinction hump @xcite . \n the quenched carbonaceous composite ( qcc ) , which shows a feature similar to the interstellar 220 nm hump @xcite , has also been shown to contain graphitic shell structures @xcite . \n it is not unexpected that the band features of carbon onions , if exist , also appear in the infrared region . in the present paper \n we simply propose the possibility that the interband feature of graphite in the far - infrared could appear in the emissivity spectrum of particles consisting of curved graphitic sheets and the observed broad interstellar feature around 100@xmath0 m may be accounted for by carbon onion grains . \n experimental work is definitely needed for further investigations . \n in the present paper we reported the detection of two far - infrared features at 65@xmath0 m and 100@xmath0 m in the diffuse infrared emission . \n the 65@xmath0 m band can reasonably be attributed to the ca - rich silicate , diopside . \n if this identification is correct , this is the first detection of a crystalline silicate feature in the interstellar diffuse emission . \n the interstellar 100@xmath0 m feature seems to be broader and peaked at longer wavelengths than the calcite feature seen in evolved stars although the precise estimate of the band profile is difficult . as a possible band carrier \n we investigate the possibility that the feature originates from carbon onion grains . while the observed feature may be accounted for by carbon onion grains if the assumed optical properties are adequate , the appearance of the feature is sensitive to the electronic structure of carbon onions . \n the origin of the interstellar 100@xmath0 m feature must be investigated in further experimental studies . \n the authors thank k. kawara , y. satoh , t. tanab , h. okuda , t. tsuji , h. shibai , and other members of the japanese iso group for their continuous help and support . \n we also thank s. tomita and s. hayashi for stimulating discussions on the optical properties of carbon onions and h. chihara and c. koike for providing us the far -

        "abstract": "This study reports far-infrared spectral features at 65 μm and 100 μm in star-forming regions, suggesting carriers are widespread in interstellar space. The 65 μm feature aligns with diopside, marking the first crystalline silicate detection in the interstellar medium if confirmed. The 100 μm feature, broader and shifted compared to calcite features in stars, may originate from carbon onion grains. These curved graphitic structures enhance interband transitions, supporting their candidacy as carriers, though further experimental verification is needed."

        "article": "processes of meson electroproduction have played an important role in studying the structure and properties of matter ( see , _ e.g. _ review  @xcite ) . in the past few years , however , reactions with production of dileptons in hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus collisions have drawn much attention @xcite . in these reactions \n virtual photons , which materialize as dileptons ( _ e.g. _ , the @xmath2 pair ) , carry unique information on properties of matter because the processes in which the particle structure is formed proceed in the timelike region of the `` mass '' ( @xmath3 ) of the virtual photon . therefore , further investigation of these reactions is necessary and promising in acquisition of new and perhaps unexpected information about the form factors of hadrons and nuclei .    the inverse pion electroproduction ( ipe ) , @xmath1 , ( or dileptonproduction ) , being for a long time the only source of information on the nucleon electromagnetic structure in the timelike region , has been investigated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite since the beginning of the 1960s . in refs . \n @xcite , we worked out the method of extracting the pion and nucleon electromagnetic form factors from ipe at low energies . \n this method has been successfully applied in the analysis of experimental data on the nucleon and @xmath4c and @xmath5li nuclei  @xcite and values of the form factors were obtained for the first time in the timelike region of @xmath3 ranging from 0.05 to 0.22 ( gev / c)@xmath6 . in refs . \n @xcite , the authors proposed to use ipe at intermediate ( above @xmath7 resonances ) energies and small @xmath8 to study the nucleon electromagnetic structure and justified it up to @xmath9 . \n though experimental data @xcite on the @xmath10 process are now available , there still remains a wide range of @xmath3 ( up to @xmath11 ) , where the form factors can not be measured directly in these experiments . on the other hand , \n the intense pion beams available now enable one to perform more detailed experiments on ipe aimed at both extracting the hadron structure and carrying out a multipole analysis similar to those for photoproduction and electroproduction ( see,_e.g . \n _ , @xcite ) . \n such experiments can address interesting topics . \n for example , in the @xmath12 region it is challenging to verify the @xmath3 dependence of the color - magnetic - force contribution found in the constituent quark model @xcite . \n it is , therefore , worth recalling the earlier discovered properties of the photoproduction , electroproduction , and ipe to consistently substantiate methods of studying the electromagnetic and weak structure of the nucleon on the basis of the ipe data in the first resonance region , and to provide new results of this analysis . \n additional motive for studying ipe in the first resonance region is the possibility of investigating the nucleon weak structure by utilizing the same data as for the electromagnetic structure . \n this possibility is based on the current algebra ( ca ) description and on the remarkable property of ipe . in the ipe process \n the creation of the @xmath2 pairs of maximal mass ( at the `` quasithreshold '' ) is dominated by the born mechanism , whereas the rescattering - effect contributions are at the level of radiative corrections up to the total @xmath7 energy @xmath13 gev ( the `` quasithreshold theorem '' ) @xcite . due to this property , \n the threshold ca theorems for the pion electroproduction and photoproduction can be justified in the case of ipe up to the indicated energy @xcite . \n this allows one to avoid threshold difficulties when using the ipe data ( unlike the electroproduction one ) for extracting the weak form factors of the nucleon . \n furthermore , in the case of ipe there is no strong kinematic restriction inherent to the @xmath14 capture and no kinematic suppression of contributions of the induced pseudoscalar nucleon form factor to the cross sections of `` straight '' processes , such as @xmath15 , present because of multiplying by the lepton masses . \n information on the pseudoscalar nucleon form factor @xmath16 , which is practically absent for the above reasons , is important because @xmath16 contains contributions of states with the pion quantum numbers and , therefore , it is related to the chiral symmetry breaking . this would enable us , _ \n e.g. _ , to test the goldberger  treiman relation . \n another aim of this paper is to draw attention of experimenters to the process @xmath1 as a natural and unique laboratory for investigating the hadron structure . \n one could use these processes for determining the baryon resonance dynamics based on the study of the @xmath17 interference pattern @xcite . \n on the other hand , investigation of the exclusive reactions @xmath18 in experiments with high - energy pions at large invariant mass of the dilepton and small squared momentum transfer to the nucleon could provide access to generalized parton distributions as suggested in @xcite . \n this paper is organized as follows . in sec . \n ii we give the basic formalism for the unified treatment of the reactions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . in sec . \n iii we present our dispersion - relation model for unified description of these three reactions and compare the calculated results with experimental data . \n to clearly explain our method , we choose a simple version of the model , which satisfactorily describes the data on the photoproduction and electroproduction . in sec . \n iv , we outline the method of determining the nucleon electromagnetic form factors from low - energy ipe and discuss some results of its application to analysis of the ipe data on the nucleon . \n section  v is devoted to extracting the pseudoscalar nucleon form factor from the same ipe data , and interpretation of the results is given . \n concluding remarks are presented in sec . \n appendices present the relations between the amplitudes , derivation of the quasithreshold constraints for the multipole amplitudes on the basis of the principle of the first - class maximum analyticity , and explanation of the compensation effect . \n we consider the reactions @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 in the framework of the unified model . \n this approach is natural because in the one - photon approximation , due to the @xmath22-invariance , research into these three processes is related to a study of the process  @xmath23 with the hadron current  @xmath24 , where  @xmath25 ,  @xmath26 ,  and  @xmath27   correspond to the pion photoproduction , electroproduction , and ipe , respectively . \n this allows us to predict peculiarities of the ipe dynamics on the basis of a rich experimental material on the electroproduction and photoproduction and to test the reliability of the unified model for these three processes . \n the @xmath28-matrix element for the electroproduction in the one - photon approximation is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the matrix element of the lepton electromagnetic current , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 are the four - momenta of the initial ( final ) electron , nucleon , and final pion , respectively . \n momentum of the virtual photon is @xmath36 ( @xmath37 for ipe ) , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are mandelstam variables . \n conservation of the lepton and hadron electromagnetic currents implies @xmath41 .    assuming the @xmath22-invariance , for the ipe process one must use the spinor @xmath42 instead of @xmath43 in the lepton current ( [ lept.current ] ) . \n then @xmath44 is timelike , and  @xmath45   is the range of @xmath3 values for fixed @xmath46 . \n the hadron current @xmath24 can be expanded using the six independent covariant gauge -

energy region from the threshold up to @xmath104  gev . \n moreover , this model is adequate for our purpose , namely to formulate the method for determination of the form factors in the timelike region , for the following reasons . \n first , in the dispersion - relation approach , the spectral functions in the first resonance region are expressed through the nucleon electromagnetic form factors and the phase shift of the @xmath7-scattering @xmath105 . \n this reduces considerably the number of fitted parameters , which is especially important in the ipe analysis . \n second , in the @xmath103 region , the electric @xmath106 and scalar @xmath107 quadrupoles , which ( as the magnetic dipole @xmath108 ) describe excitation of the resonance @xmath103 , amount to not more than 15% of @xmath108 . \n for example , the photoproduction data @xcite give the value @xmath109 for the @xmath110 ratio . \n phenomenological results for the @xmath3 dependence of the @xmath110 and @xmath111 ratios are not stable yet and depend upon the method of their extraction from electroproduction data ( see discussion of this point in ref . \n @xcite , p.  698 ) . \n however , these ratios do not exceed respectively , 7 and 15% up to @xmath112 ( gev / c)@xmath6 . \n based on the quark model calculations ( see , _ \n e.g. _ , refs . \n @xcite ) , we suppose that an analogous situation takes place also for @xmath113 , at least up to @xmath114  0.3 ( gev / c)@xmath6 . \n therefore , at the first stage of our analysis we neglect the quadrupole excitations of @xmath103 , which we expect to be a good approximation for processes with unpolarised nucleons . \n the conventional procedure of reggeization provides us with behaviour of the invariant amplitudes for @xmath115 and small @xmath8 @xcite @xmath116 consequently , in a complete @xmath46-channel description , we should write a fixed-@xmath102 dispersion relation with one subtraction at finite energy for the isovector amplitude @xmath117 and without subtractions for the remaining amplitudes , taking into account their crossing properties . however , the dispersion integrals with the spectral functions which describe the magnetic excitation of the @xmath103 resonance converge very well already at @xmath118 2  gev for all the amplitudes @xmath66 . \n therefore , we use the fixed-@xmath102 dispersion relations without subtraction at the finite energy @xcite for all isovector amplitudes @xmath119 and we take the born approximation for the isoscalar ones @xmath120 where  @xmath121 , @xmath122\\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath123\\;,\\ ] ] with the @xmath7 coupling constant @xmath124 and the normalisation of the form factors : @xmath125 . the terms @xmath126 and @xmath127 belong only to the amplitude @xmath117 .    note that @xmath53 and @xmath54 have the kinematic pole at @xmath55 . \n however , these singularities are cancelled out kinematically because these amplitudes enter into the matrix element through the combination  @xmath128 which is equal to  @xmath129 , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are the ball amplitudes which have been proved to have no kinematic singularities @xcite . in specific model calculations , the condition @xmath132=0\\ ; , \\ ] ] which is ensured by the form of the term @xmath127 ( [ eq : c5 ] ) , guarantees absence of the singularity at @xmath55 . \n the spectral functions @xmath133 are supposed to describe the magnetic excitation of the @xmath103 resonance @xmath134}~ a_i(w , t,\\lambda^2),\\ ] ] where  @xmath135 ,   @xmath105 is the corresponding phase shift of the @xmath7-scattering amplitude , for which we utilize the prescription from ref . \n @xcite , and @xmath136 with the coefficients @xmath137 @xmath138 , & ~~\\beta_1=\\frac{1}{2}(w+m -

pr - n ] we compare results of our model for the differential cross section with @xmath140-photoproduction data . in fig . \n [ fig : e - pr - n1 ] we show comparison with the electroproduction data on the proton for the transversal @xmath141 and longitudinal @xmath142 parts of the cross section @xmath143\\;.\\ ] ] the differential cross sections for the forward electroproduction of pions by transversal and longitudinal virtual photons are presented in fig . \n [ fig : e - pr - n2 ] . \n in general , we obtain quite a good agreement with the pion photoproduction and electroproduction data on unpolarized nucleons , especially in the region of the @xmath103 resonance ( @xmath144  gev ) . in the case of the @xmath140 photoproduction , \n the results are very good up to @xmath13  gev ( @xmath145  gev ) , see fig . \n [ fig : ph - pr - n ] . \n it is obvious that our model can be further improved by including the quadrupole excitation of the @xmath103 resonance ( @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) in the spectral functions . \n however , a still more elaborate model should include , in addition to the quadrupole excitation , contributions of other nucleon isobars and high - energy `` tails '' to the absorption parts of the amplitudes to ensure a balanced consideration of small corrections . \n furthermore , analytic continuation of the corrected absorption parts of the amplitudes into the unobservable region in the dispersion integrals , @xmath148 for @xmath149 , requires use of the quasithreshold relations ( following from causality analyticity ) between the electric and longitudinal multipoles @xcite in which `` toroid '' multipoles appear @xcite . on the contrary , \n the analytic continuation with the approximation ( [ eq : ima ] ) is immediate . \n however , having in mind the quality of contemporary experimental data , the above - stated simple model seems to be quite sufficient ( see figs .  [ \n fig : ph - pr - n]-[fig : e - pr - n2 ] ) . \n application of the model to the calculations for ipe shows an interesting growth of the relative contribution of the born terms with @xmath3 and their dominance in the neighbourhood of the value @xmath150 @xcite . \n this approximate dominance of the born terms has a model - independent explanation . \n it is related to the quasithreshold theorem @xcite , which means that at the quasithreshold , @xmath151 , the ipe amplitude becomes the born one in the energy region from the threshold up to @xmath13  gev . \n this remarkable dynamics of ipe distinguishes it essentially from the photoproduction and electroproduction , where rescattering effects amount @xmath152 . \n let us explain the quasithreshold behaviour of the ipe amplitude . \n as @xmath153 the multipole amplitudes behave in the following way @xmath154 therefore , at @xmath155 only the electric ( @xmath156 and @xmath157 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) dipoles survive . in addition , the number of independent dipole transitions diminishes to the two ones at the quasithreshold due to the quasithreshold constraints @xmath160 which arise from the causality ( analyticity ) . \n the selection rules which follow from the parity conservation and the value of the angular momentum of the stopped virtual photon , @xmath161 , restrict possible s - channel resonances at the quasithreshold to the following sets : @xmath162 , _ etc . _ ] and @xmath163 , _ etc . \n behaviour of the multipole amplitudes as @xmath164 and @xmath153 and the quasithreshold constraints among them are derived in appendix  b.    since the @xmath46- and @xmath165-wave @xmath7 resonances are excited at energies above 1.5  gev , one can expect that the dipoles @xmath156 and @xmath157 are dominated by the born terms below this energy . \n this is in agreement with the multipole analyses of charged pion photoproduction and confirmed by the dispersion - relation calculations at @xmath166 . \n we can , therefore , conclude that in the quasithreshold region , the ipe amplitude is given by the born terms with accuracy better than @xmath167 . at energies below @xmath168  gev \n , we can write for the quasithreshold ipe @xmath169.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the real experiment , however , one can not realize strictly the quasithreshold conditions and , therefore , the realistic model ( presented above ) is needed . in choosing the optimal geometry of the experiment for deriving the form factors , the `` compensation curves '' @xcite can help . \n the curves are defined as curves in the @xmath170 plane along which the differential cross section is given only by the born terms . \n these curves can be constructed by comparing photoproduction experimental data with the born cross section and employing the existence theorem for implicit functions ( more details on the compensation effect is given in appendix  c ) . \n the method of determining the electromagnetic form factors from low - energy ipe is , therefore , based on utilizing the quasithreshold theorem , the realistic dispersion - relation model , and the compensation curve . \n this method has been already used in the experiments on the nucleon and nuclei @xmath4c and @xmath5li @xcite . \n .[tab1]electromagnetic form factors obtained in experiments on the nucleon . \n the virtual photon momentum @xmath3 is given in units of the pion mass . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab1 ] , we present values of the electromagnetic form factors obtained in experiments on the nucleon . in tab . \n [ tab1 ] , the same experimental errors are given for @xmath171 and @xmath172 because in this @xmath3-range these form factors can be connected with each other via the spectral function by the relation @xmath173 . \n the quantity @xmath174 , taken from the dispersion calculations @xcite , possesses a significantly smaller theoretical uncertainty than the calculated quantities @xmath171 and @xmath172 . \n this is caused by cancellation of terms with the large uncertainties in the spectral function of @xmath174 which , therefore , is dominated by the one - nucleon exchange contribution in the region @xmath175 . \n one can see that this result is rather model - independent . \n then the same experimental errors can be given for @xmath171 and @xmath172 . \n of course , having high - statistics data for ipe one need not use the relation of @xmath171 with @xmath172 in extracting these quantities . \n the values of @xmath171 are quite consistent with the calculations of the nucleon electromagnetic structure in framework of the unitary and analytic vector - meson dominance model @xcite . \n let us look at the possibility of investigating the form factor @xmath176 of the @xmath177 vertex at @xmath178 . \n whereas a measurement of the differential cross section for the electroproduction with unpolarised electrons in the @xmath12 region at @xmath179 out of the compensation curve allows one to extract information about the form factors of the @xmath177 vertex , this approach is not sufficiently effective for ipe because the dominance of the born mechanism which reaches @xmath180 at the quasithreshold is also considerable at lower values of @xmath3 . \n it turns out that the analysis of asymmetry @xmath181 ( [ p_e ] ) in the dilepton production near the quasithreshold gives us that chance . \n we consider the quantity @xmath93 , connected to the asymmetry @xmath181 . \n it can be expanded to series in @xmath182 near the quasithreshold with taking into account formulas ( [ t_i - f_i ] ) , ( [ m - pole - expantion ] ) and ( [ gk - behavior ] ) @xmath183 the lowest term of the formal series in eq . \n ( [ t_5-expand ] ) @xmath184_{{\\bf k}=0}\\ ; , \\ ] ] equals zero at the quasithreshold as it follows from the constraints ( [ q - thr - constr ] ) . \n behaviour of @xmath93 for @xmath153 then is @xmath185 where @xmath186_{\\bf k=0 } .\\ ] ] in the @xmath103 region , the amplitudes @xmath156 and @xmath157 are dominated by the born terms , and the imaginary parts of form factors are negligible . \n contributions of @xmath106 and @xmath187 amount to less than 15% of that of @xmath108 . \n multipole amplitudes @xmath188 and @xmath187 , related to the excitation of the @xmath189 resonance , generally have to be very small , as it is seen in analyses of photoproduction ( especially on the neutron ) . therefore , with a good accuracy , \n we obtain @xmath190 since the quasithreshold relations ( [ gk - behavior ] ) seem to be approximately realized in a rather wide interval in @xmath3 , the asymmetry @xmath181 has to be sensitive to @xmath191 in the @xmath103 region . \n the measurement of @xmath181 would , therefore , allow one to study quantitatively the assumption about the dominance of the magnetic dipole transition and to extract information on the form factor @xmath176 at @xmath113 . \n this is possible because the contribution of the background part of the amplitude to @xmath93 is considerably suppressed in the quasithreshold region , the background part reducing as @xmath192 for @xmath182 becoming zero . \n now let us discuss another interesting possibility of investigating the weak nucleon structure related to the nucleon gamow \n teller transition described by the matrix element @xmath193\\gamma_5u(p_1),\\ ] ] where @xmath194 is the axial - vector current , and @xmath195 and @xmath196 are the axial and induced pseudoscalar form factors , respectively . \n an alternative description of ipe  which utilizes the current commutators , pcac , and completeness  allows one to derive a low - energy theorem at the threshold , @xmath197 and @xmath198 , related to the approximate chiral symmetry and @xmath199 corrections . \n minimization of the continuum contribution at the quasithreshold justifies this approach up to @xmath13  gev @xcite with the continuum corrections being practically the same as in the dispersion - relation description . \n then , one obtains for the longitudinal part of the @xmath200 amplitude at the quasithreshold retaining only the leading terms in @xmath201 @xcite , such that @xmath202\\bigr\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constant of the @xmath203 decay @xmath204 is defined by  @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and the quasithreshold values of the variables are @xmath207    @xmath208 was measured in various experiments , first of all in @xmath209 and @xmath210 . \n it is reasonable to use first this result @xmath211 however , it is difficult to obtain reliable information on @xmath16 in these experiments since its contribution to cross sections is kinematically suppressed ( it is multiplied by the lepton masses ) . in the @xmath14-capture and @xmath212-decay experiments , there is a kinematically restricted small range of @xmath8 , @xmath213 , in which the weak form factor can be determined , though with a large error . \n for example , its value extracted from measurements of the @xmath14-capture in hydrogen @xcite is  @xmath214 . \n @xmath16 has also been measured in the capture of polarized muons by @xmath215si nuclei @xcite . \n equation  ( [ long.part:ca ] ) shows that the kinematic suppression of the @xmath16 contribution is absent when the ipe data at the quasithreshold are used for extracting @xmath16 . in this way \n , the pseudoscalar form factor @xmath216 can be determined in the range up to @xmath217   ( which corresponds to @xmath13  gev ) . adopting the quasithreshold kinematics \n , one can avoid the threshold difficulties that are present when applying an analogous method to the analysis of electroproduction data . \n next we shall follow the method of ref . \n first , using the @xmath218 and @xmath219 values obtained in the analysis of the ipe data on the nucleon @xcite , we obtain 10 data points for the longitudinal part of the @xmath220 amplitude at the quasithreshold . \n these data points , which can be considered as experimental ones , are depicted in fig . \n [ fig : long - exp ] .    for @xmath216 we chose the dispersion relation without subtractions : @xmath221 the residue at the pole @xmath222 is determined by the pcac relation . when only the @xmath223-pole term is considered in @xmath16 , \n the result is inconsistent with the experimental data as demonstrated in fig . \n [ fig : long - exp ] ( dashed line ) . therefore , the dispersion integral in eq . \n ( [ g_p : dr ] ) should be considered \n . it could be approximated by the contributions of possible intermediate three - pion and resonance states with the pion quantum numbers . however , since the contributions of nonresonant three - particle states must be suppressed by the phase volume , it is , therefore , reasonable to approximate the integral in ( [ g_p : dr ] ) by a resonance - pole term . \n a satisfactory description is obtained if one takes the following expression for @xmath216 with the indicated values of parameters : @xmath224 where  @xmath225 , the @xmath226 weak - decay constant @xmath227 is defined by  @xmath228 , and @xmath229 and @xmath230 are the coupling constants of the @xmath223 and @xmath226 states with the nucleon , respectively . as seen from the definitions of the weak - decay constants \n , one must expect that  @xmath231 to reflect a tendency of another way ( in addition to the goldstone one ) in which the axial current is conserved for vanishing quark masses . \n this behaviour is demonstrated in various models with some nonlocality which describe chiral symmetry breaking @xcite . \n notice that the pole at @xmath232 in eq . \n ( [ g_p ] ) , situated considerably lower than the poles of the known contributing states @xmath233 and @xmath234 , is indispensable for describing the obtained experimental data on ipe .    in fig . \n [ fig : gp - ratio ] we show the ratio @xmath235 in comparison with the values obtained in @xmath14-capture on hydrogen @xcite and in analysis of data on the @xmath236 electroproduction off the proton near the threshold @xcite . \n the error bars on the solid line indicate that the values of @xmath216 determined by this method are of high accuracy . \n one can see that the results of refs . \n @xcite agree with the pion - pole dominance hypothesis in a large range of momentum transfer unlike our result in which the hypothesis is valid only in a narrow @xmath102 range , whereas outside the range the contribution of continuum is considerable . \n note that the contributions of the pion radial excitations , @xmath233 and @xmath234 , which are rather distant from this region , are suppressed and their consideration would only slightly increase the mass of @xmath237 . \n the parameters of this pole term in ( [ g_p ] ) might be changed more considerably if one assumes the channel @xmath238 with the recently discovered scalar @xmath239 @xcite , due to the possible multichannel nature of this state . in any case , the conclusion will remain valid that the state with @xmath240 in the range 500 - 800  mev is needed for explaining the obtained ipe data . \n let us add that a possible signal of the charged state of this isotriplet was observed in the @xmath241 system @xcite and interpreted as the first radial excitation of the pion in the framework of the relativistic quark model @xcite based on the covariant formalism for two - particle equations . accepting this designation for @xmath242 and taking the estimate for the @xmath226 weak - decay constant in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model generalized by using effective quark interactions with a finite range , @xmath243  mev , we obtain @xmath244 . \n there are no suitable theoretical calculations for this coupling constant now . in the njl model \n , the consideration of radial excitations of states requires introducing some nonlocality . \n since a successful calculation of the @xmath7 coupling constant in that model enforces one to go beyond the framework of the tree approximation and take loop corrections into account @xcite , it seems that a satisfactory evaluation of @xmath245 in that approximation can not avoid assuming some nonlocality . \n of course , a more reliable interpretation of @xmath226 requires investigation of other processes with @xmath226 . \n existence of this state would also raise the question on its su(3 ) partners . \n a careful ( re)analysis of the corresponding processes is , therefore , desirable in this energy region . \n we have demonstrated that a subsequent investigation of ipe is necessary for extracting both unique information about the electromagnetic structure of particles in the sub-@xmath0 threshold region of the timelike values of @xmath3 and the nucleon weak structure in the spacelike region . \n the former is interesting especially now , _ \n e.g. _ , in connection with discussion about the hidden strangeness of the nucleon ( see , _ \n e.g. _ , @xcite ) and quasinuclear bound @xmath246 state @xcite . \n analyses of the experimental ipe data in the first @xmath7 resonance region allow one to obtain the values of the form factor @xmath171 at timelike values of @xmath3 which are quite consistent with the calculations in the framework of the unitary analytic vector - meson dominance model @xcite . \n an inevitable step that is necessary for the study of the electromagnetic structure of nucleon - isobar systems in the timelike @xmath3-region is a multipole analysis of ipe similar to that for the photoproduction and electroproduction , _ \n e.g. _ @xcite . at present , with the intense pion beams being available , it is possible to perform experiments aiming at carrying out that analysis . in a construction of the dispersion - quark model in the second and third @xmath7 resonance region , \n the multichannel character of the nucleon isobars must be taken into account , _ \n e.g. _ , by the method of ref . \n @xcite or utilizing the proper uniforming variables @xcite . \n as we already mentioned , our method was used in the analysis of the pion - induced dilepton production on the nucleon and light nuclei . \n it is worth making some remarks about the analysis of the experiment on the @xmath5li nucleus with a @xmath236 beam at 500  mev / c @xcite . \n the missing mass analysis of the data has shown that about half of the events are related to disintegration processes of the nucleus which are dominated by the reaction +  @xmath247 . \n + on analyzing this process it was assumed that the pion - nucleus amplitude is determined by the neutron - pole mechanism , and the nuclear part ( the vertex function of the @xmath248 ) was calculated in the nucleon cluster model @xcite . \n the remaining events belong to the process +  @xmath249 . \n + when all the events were analyzed ( with and without disintegration of the nucleus ) , the cross section on the nucleus was supposed to be additively connected with the cross section on the individual nucleon and nuclear effects were taken into account via screening . in both cases , our model was used for describing ipe on the individual nucleon . \n the obtained values for @xmath171 are again quite consistent with the calculations in ref . \n @xcite . in the case of the reaction without disintegration of the nucleus , \n one observed there the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleus in the timelike @xmath3 region for the first time . \n unfortunately , in the indicated analysis , unique information on the electromagnetic structure of the nucleus in the timelike region was lost . \n generally , it seems at present that there is no satisfactory concept of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleus in the timelike region . \n a satisfactory description must take into account both a constituent character of the nucleus ( and the corresponding analytic properties ) and more subtle ( than the screening ) collective nuclear effects . \n finally , it should be noticed that a more reliable interpretation of the observed state @xmath250 requires solving a number of questions , both theoretical and experimental . in the pseudoscalar sector , \n states of various nature are possible , except for @xmath251 , the @xmath252 and @xmath253 glueballs , @xmath254 hybrids , and multiquark states \n . however , all the models and lattice calculations give masses of those unusual states considerably greater than 1  gev . therefore , the most probable interpretation of @xmath250 seems to be the first radial pion excitation . \n the authors are grateful to s.b . \n gerasimov , v.a . \n meshcheryakov , and g.b . \n pontecorvo for useful discussions and interest in this work . yu.s . acknowledges also support provided by the votruba -

dowell ] ) taking into account the complete @xmath3 behaviour of the latter as @xmath262 ( [ gk - behavior ] ) , ( [ c : el-,ll-.m])-([c : el+,ll+.m ] ) . \n the relations for multipole amplitudes as @xmath292 are , of course , not fulfilled in the reaction under consideration . \n a region of their applicability is the c.m . \n system of pion and nucleon in the @xmath3 channel @xmath313 at the stopped antinucleon ( @xmath314 ) . \n the relations between multipole amplitudes at the quasithreshold are very important for our considerations because the condition @xmath262 is realized ( at @xmath149 ) in the investigated reaction @xmath315 unlike the electroproduction and photoproduction . \n the introduced quantities @xmath316 ( [ c : el-,ll-.m ] ) and @xmath317 ( [ c : el+,ll+.m ] ) are not formal coefficients of expansion in a series but they can be related to `` toroid '' multipole amplitudes @xmath318 @xcite that have a definite physical meaning . the relations ( [ c : el-,ll-.m ] ) and ( [ c : el+,ll+.m ] ) must be used with necessity when carrying out analytic continuations of spectral functions in the dispersion relations for ipe into the unphysical region @xmath319 . therefore , it seems that application ( from the beginning ) of toroid multipoles @xmath318 instead of @xmath320 is rather relevant in the timelike region . \n here we shall find a region of variables @xmath321 , and @xmath3 where the cross sections of the processes of pion photoproduction , electroproduction , and ipe are described only by the born terms . \n let us write the differential cross section of virtual photoproduction as a sum of two terms @xmath322 where the first term is the born cross section and @xmath323 takes into account the final - state interaction and its interference with the born part of the amplitude .    to establish the conditions under which @xmath324 we use the existence theorem for implicit functions . by this theorem , \n if equation ( [ phi - cond . \n ] ) allows the solution @xmath325 , @xmath326 , @xmath327 , and the function @xmath323 and its partial derivatives of the first order are continuous in the vicinity of the point @xmath328 and the derivative @xmath329 at this point is different from zero , that is , @xmath330 then there exists only one function @xmath331 which satisfies equation ( [ phi - cond . ] ) in some vicinity of the point @xmath332 and takes the value @xmath326 at @xmath325 , @xmath333 . \n this function and its partial derivatives are continuous in the vicinity of the point @xmath332 .    according to this theorem , if we find at least one point in the space of @xmath334 , where the effects of rescattering and their interference with the born terms compensate each other , then , since the cross section is continuous in the physical region , there is a surface of `` compensation '' in this space on which the cross section is the born one . \n the intersections of this surface with every plane @xmath335 define some curves in the plane @xmath170 each of them being characterized by its own value of @xmath3 and the cross section ( [ dif.cr.sec . ] ) being the born one along them . \n thus , we obtain a one - parameter set of the compensation curves with @xmath3 as a parameter . \n consider the curves @xmath25 in more detail . \n we shall use @xmath336 instead of variable @xmath102 , where @xmath84 is a scattering angle in the c.m . system . \n if the compensation takes place , then in the plane @xmath337 we ought to have the compensation curve @xmath338 continuous in the physical region . generally speaking \n , there may be several curves of this kind , because the function @xmath339 can always be represented as a polynomial in powers of @xmath340 : @xmath341 and the equation @xmath342 can have several real roots @xmath343 . \n however , due to the theorem mentioned above , the curves do not intersect , since only one curve can pass through the given point .    in the case of the pion photoproduction , \n available experimental data are sufficient to construct the compensation curves @xcite . to this end , it is necessary to find out the intersection points of the experimental differential cross section with the calculated born cross section and plot these points in the plane @xmath337 or @xmath344 . in fig . \n [ fig : comp - curv ] the compensation curves for the charged pion photoproduction are shown . calculating the born cross sections , we take into account the interaction of the photon only with the charge \n . therefore , along these curves the experimental cross sections are completely described by the electric born terms . \n one can see that at high energies , the compensation curves pass through small angles in accordance with the electric born model ( ebm ) @xcite . \n the compensation curves show also that an applicability of ebm to the cross section extends to the whole energy range , but at the corresponding angles , giving a more complete and transparent picture . \n of course , there are also compensation curves corresponding to the total born amplitude . \n now , if one assumes that for processes of the pion electroproduction and ipe , when @xmath166 , the compensation curves are not much different from the corresponding curves for the photoproduction @xmath345 , then along these curves the model dependence of description of the processes should be minimal . in the resonance region , this assumption would be reasonable if the change of @xmath3 does not lead to the essential reconstruction of the helicity ( or multipole ) structure of the excitation of the corresponding resonance . in the first resonance region , calculations , _ \n e.g. _ , in the dispersion theory , which agree with the predictions of the quark models ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and with the result of the phenomenological analysis of the electroproduction data ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , confirm a dominance preservation of the magnetic dipole excitation of the @xmath103 resonance with the change of @xmath346 . \n quark models expand this situation to values of @xmath178 . in our dispersion model \n , it was verified that the compensation angle @xmath347 is invariable with @xmath3 for the cross sections of the processes @xmath348 with the transverse virtual photons at @xmath349 gev @xmath350 . \n this prediction was confirmed by the experiment @xcite for the timelike values of @xmath3 : @xmath351 . in the second and third resonance regions , the analysis of experimental data for electroproduction ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) \n gives a considerable change ( with @xmath352 ) of the helicity structure for the excitation of leading resonances , which is especially essential approximately at @xmath353 . \n the compensation curves exist also for the asymmetry in the charged pion production by the polarized @xmath354-quanta @xmath355/ [ d{\\sigma}_{\\perp}/dt + d{\\sigma}_{\\parallel}/dt]\\;.\\ ] ] for example , at @xmath356  gev the compensation in @xmath357 ( [ ph - asym ] ) takes place at @xmath358 for the @xmath359 photoproduction . \n since at high energies and small @xmath360 ebm ( as any reasonable model explaining the sharp forward peak in @xmath361 for the @xmath359 photoproduction ) gives the sign and size of @xmath362 in the forward direction , the compensation curves for @xmath362 above the resonance region go through approximately the same values of the angles @xmath363 as for @xmath364 . \n this fact is explained practically model independently . \n the plausibility of assumption that the compensation curves at high energies and small angles and at @xmath166 are not much different from the corresponding curves for @xmath25 is justified by successful application of ebm to the description of the processes of electroproduction and @xmath365 at high energies and @xmath366 @xcite . in any case , the compensation curves help one to reveal the optimal experimental conditions for studying the form factors @xmath367 and @xmath368 in processes of the pion electroproduction and ipe . \n e. amaldi , s. fubini , g. furlan , _ electroproduction at low energy and hadron form factors _ , springer tracts in modern physics * 83 * ( springer , berlin , 1979 ) . \n surovtsev , f.g . \n tkebuchava , yad . \n fiz . * 55 * , 2138 ( 1992 ) . \n blokhintseva , yu.s . \n surovtsev , m. nagy , acta physica slovaca * 49 * , 351 ( 1999 ) . \n titov , b. kmpfer , eur . \n j. a * 12 * , 217 ( 2001 ) . \n berger , m. diehl , b. pire , phys . \n b * 523 * , 265 ( 2001 ) . \n lutz , b. friman , m. soyeur , nucl . \n a * 713 * , 97 ( 2003 ) . \n bratkovskaya , w. cassing , u. mosel , nucl . \n a * 686 * , 568 ( 2001 ) . \n geffen , phys . rev . * 125 * , 1745 ( 1962 ) ; j. loubaton , j. tran thanh van , nucl . \n b * 2 * , 342 ( 1967 ) . \n surovtsev , f.g . \n tkebuchava , jinr communication p2 -

        "abstract": "This study presents methods to analyze hadron electromagnetic structure in the sub-threshold timelike region and nucleon weak structure in the spacelike region using pion inverse electroproduction data. It unifies photoproduction, electroproduction, and inverse electroproduction in the first resonance region through a dispersion-relation model. The model leverages inverse electroproduction's unique, model-independent properties and offers applications in studying particle dynamics and form factors, contributing to a deeper understanding of hadron and nucleon structures."

        "article": "model selection is an important problem in many areas including machine learning . \n if a proper model is not selected , any effort for parameter estimation or prediction of the algorithm s outcome is hopeless . \n given a set of candidate models , the goal of model selection is to select the model that best approximates the observed data and captures its underlying regularities . \n model selection criteria are defined such that they strike a balance between the _ goodness - of - fit ( gof ) _ , and the _ generalizability _ or _ \n complexity _ of the models . \n goodness - of - fit measures how well a model capture the regularity in the data . \n generalizability / complexity is the assessment of the performance of the model on unseen data or how accurately the model fits / predicts the future data . \n models with higher complexity than necessary can suffer from overfitting and poor generalization , while models that are too simple will underfit and have low gof  @xcite . \n cross - validation  @xcite , bootstrapping  @xcite , akaike information criterion ( aic )  @xcite , and bayesian information criterion ( bic )  @xcite , are well known examples of traditional model selection . in re - sampling methods such as cross - validation and bootstraping , the generalization error of the model \n is estimated using monte carlo simulation . \n in contrast with re - sampling methods , the model selection methods like aic and bic do not require validation to compute the model error , and are computationally efficient . in these procedures \n an _ information criterion _ is defined such that the generalization error is estimated by penalizing the model s error on observed data . \n a large number of information criteria have been introduced with different motivations that lead to different theoretical properties . \n for instance , the tighter penalization parameter in bic favors simpler models , while aic works better when the dataset has a very large sample size . \n kernel methods are strong , computationally efficient analytical tools that are capable of working on high dimensional data with arbitrarily complex structure . \n they have been successfully applied in wide range of applications such as classification , and regression . in kernel methods , \n the data are mapped from their original space to a higher dimensional feature space , the reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) . \n the idea behind this mapping is to transform the nonlinear relationships between data points in the original space into an easy - to - compute linear learning problem in the feature space . \n for example , in kernel regression the response variable is described as a linear combination of the embedded data . \n any algorithm that can be represented through dot products has a kernel evaluation . \n this operation , called kernelization , makes it possible to transform traditional , already proven , model selection methods into stronger , corresponding kernel methods . \n the literature on kernel methods has , however , mostly focused on kernel selection and on tuning the kernel parameters , but only limited work being done on kernel - based model selection  @xcite . in this study , we investigate a kernel - based information criterion for ridge regression models . in kernel ridge regression ( krr ) , tuning the ridge parameters to find the most predictive subspace with respect to the data at hand and the unseen data is the goal of the kernel model selection criterion .    in classical model selection methods the performance of the model selection criterion is evaluated theoretically by providing a consistency proof where the sample size tends to infinity and empirically through simulated studies for finite sample sizes . \n other methods investigate a probabilistic upper bound of the generalization error  @xcite . \n proving the consistency properties of the model selection in _ kernel model selection _ is challenging . \n the proof procedure of the classical methods does not work here . \n some reasons for that are : the size of the model to evaluate problems such as under / overfitting  @xcite is not apparent ( for @xmath1 data points of dimension @xmath2 , the kernel is @xmath3 , which is independent of @xmath2 ) and asymptotic probabilities of generalization error or estimators are hard to compute in rkhs . \n researchers have kernelized the traditional model selection criteria and shown the success of their kernel model selection empirically . \n kobayashi and komaki @xcite extracted the kernel - based regularization information criterion ( kric ) using an eigenvalue equation to set the regularization parameters in kernel logistic regression and support vector machines ( svm ) . \n rosipal et al . \n @xcite developed covariance information criterion ( cic ) for model selection in kernel principal component analysis , because of its outperformed results compared to aic and bic in orthogonal linear regression . \n demyanov et al . \n @xcite , provided alternative way of calculating the likelihood function in akaike information criterion ( aic ,  @xcite and bayesian information criterion ( bic ,  @xcite ) , and used it for parameter selection in svms using the gaussian kernel .    as pointed out by van emden  @xcite , a desirable model is the one with the fewest dependent variables . thus defining a complexity term that measures the interdependency of model parameters enables one to select the most desirable model . in this study , we define a novel variable - wise variance and obtain a complexity measure as the additive combination of kernels defined on model parameters . formalizing the complexity term in this way effectively captures the interdependency of each parameter of the model . \n we call this novel method _ kernel - based information criterion ( kic)_.    model selection criterion in gaussian process regression ( gpr ;  @xcite ) , and kernel - based information complexity ( icomp ;  @xcite ) resemble kic in using a covariance - based complexity measure . \n however , the methods differ because these complexity measures capture the interdependency between the data points rather than the model parameters . \n although we can not establish the consistency properties of kic theoretically , we empirically evaluate the efficiency of kic both on synthetic and real datasets obtaining state - of - the - art results compared to leave - one - out - cross - validation ( loocv ) , kernel - based icomp , and maximum log marginal likelihood in gpr . \n the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : krr ] , we give an overview of kernel ridge regression . \n kic is described in detail in section  [ sec : kic ] . \n section  [ sec : om ] is provides a brief explanation of the methods to which kic is compared , and in section  [ sec : exp ] we evaluate the performance of kic through sets of experiments . \n in regression analysis , the regression model of the form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 can be either a linear or non - linear function .    in linear regression we have , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an observation vector ( response variable ) of size @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a full rank data matrix of independent variables of size @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , is an unknown vector of regression parameters , where @xmath12 denotes the transposition . \n we also assume that the error ( noise ) vector @xmath13 is an @xmath1-dimensional vector whose elements are drawn i.i.d , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an @xmath1-dimensional identity matrix and @xmath16 is an unknown variance . \n the regression coefficients minimize the squared errors , @xmath17 , between estimated function @xmath18 , and target function @xmath5 . \n when @xmath19 , the problem is ill - posed , so that some kind of regularization , such as tikhanov regularization ( ridge regression ) is required , and the coefficients minimize the following optimization problem @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the regularization parameter . \n the estimated regression coefficients in ridge regression @xmath22 are : @xmath23 in _ kernel _ ridge regression ( krr ) , the data matrix @xmath9 is non - linearly transformed in rkhs using a feature map @xmath24 . \n the estimated regression coefficients based on @xmath25 are : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the kernel matrix . \n equation  [ eq : theta ] does not obtain an explicit expression for @xmath28 because of @xmath24 ( the kernel trick enables one to avoid explicitly defining @xmath25 that could be numerically intractable if computed in rkhs , if known ) , thus a ridge estimator is used ( e.g. @xcite ) that excludes @xmath24 : @xmath29 using @xmath30 in the calculation of krr is similar to regularizing the regression function instead of the regression coefficients , where the objective function is : @xmath31 and @xmath32 denotes the relevant rkhs . for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 \n we have : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the kernel function , and @xmath37 . \n the main contribution of this study is to introduce a new kernel - based information criterion ( kic ) for the model selection in kernel - based regression . according to equation   kic balances between the goodness - of - fit and the complexity of the model . \n gof is defined using a log - likelihood - based function ( we maximize penalized log likelihood ) and the complexity measure is a function based on the covariance function of the parameters of the model . in the next subsections we elaborate on these terms . \n the definition of van emden @xcite for the complexity measure of a random vector is based on the interactions among random variables in the corresponding covariance matrix . \n a desirable model is the one with the fewest dependent variables . \n this reduces the information entropy and yields lower complexity . in this paper \n we focus on this definition of the complexity measures .    considering a @xmath2-variate normal distribution @xmath38 , the complexity of a covariance matrix , @xmath39 , is given by the shannon s entropy @xcite , @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the marginal and the joint entropy , and \n @xmath43 is the @xmath44 diagonal element of @xmath39 . \n @xmath45 if and only if the covariates are independent . \n the complexity measure in equation   changes with orthonormal transformations because it is dependent on the coordinates of the random variable vectors @xmath46 @xcite . \n to overcome these drawbacks , bozodgan and haughton @xcite introduced icomp information criterion with a complexity measure based on the maximal covariance complexity , which is an upper bound on the complexity measure in equation  : @xmath47 this complexity measure is proportional to the estimated arithmetic ( @xmath48 ) and geometric mean ( @xmath49 ) of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix . \n larger values of @xmath50 , indicates higher dependency between random variables , and vice versa . \n zhang @xcite introduced a kernel form of this complexity measure @xmath50 , that is computed on kernel - based covariance of the ridge estimator : @xmath51 the complexity measure in gaussian process regression ( gpr ; @xcite ) is defined as @xmath52 , a concept from the joint entropy @xmath42 ( as shown in equation  [ eq : complexity ] ) . \n in contrast to icomp and gpr , the complexity measure in kic is defined using the hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) norm of the covariance matrix , @xmath53 . minimizing this complexity measure obtains a model with more independent variables .    in the next sections , \n we explain in detail how to define the needed variable - wise variance in the complexity measure , and the computation of the complexity measure . \n +      in kernel - based model selection methods such as icomp , and gpr , the complexity measure is defined on a covariance matrix that is of size @xmath54 for @xmath9 of size @xmath10 . \n the idea behind this measure is to compute the interdependency between the model parameters , which independent of the number of the model parameters @xmath2 . in the other words , \n the concept of the size of the model is hidden because of the definition of a kernel . to have a complexity measure that depends on @xmath2 \n , we introduce variable - wise variance using an additive combination of kernels for each parameter of the model . \n let @xmath55 be the parameter vector of the kernel ridge regression : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and @xmath59 the solution of krr is given by @xmath60 . \n the quantity @xmath61 = \\sigma^2 \\operatorname{tr}[k(k+\\alpha i)^{-2 } ] $ ] can be interpreted as the sum of variances for the component - wise parameter vectors , if the following sum of component - wise kernel is introduced : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote the j - th component of vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 . with this sum kernel \n , the function @xmath67 can be written as : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a function in @xmath70 , the rkhs defined by @xmath71 . \n the parameter @xmath28 in this case is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 , and thus @xmath69 in equation  [ eq : g ] is equal to @xmath74 . \n let @xmath75 be the conditional covariance of @xmath74 or @xmath69 given @xmath76 . \n we have @xmath77,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 be the gram matrix with @xmath71 . since @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 = \\operatorname{tr}[\\sigma_{\\theta}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    formalizing the complexity term with variable - wise variance effectively captures the interdependency of each parameter of the model ( measures the significance of the contribution by the variables ) explicitly . \n +      gretton et al . \n @xcite introduced a kernel - based independence measure , namely the hilbert - schmidt independence criterion ( hsic ) , which is explained here . \n suppose @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are random vectors with feature maps @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , and @xmath86 are rkhss . \n the cross - covariance operator corresponding to the joint probability distribution @xmath87 is a linear operator , @xmath88 such that : @xmath89,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 denotes the tensor product , @xmath91= e[k(\\cdot , x)]$ ] , and @xmath92=e[k(\\cdot , y)]$ ] , for @xmath93 , and associated kernel function @xmath36 . \n the hsic measure for separable rkhs @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the squared hs - norm of the cross - covariance operator and is denoted as : @xmath94\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] * theorem 1 . * \n assume @xmath95 , and @xmath96 are compact , for all @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , @xmath101 if and only if @xmath102 , and @xmath7 are independent ( theorem 4 in @xcite ) . + by computing the hsic on covariance matrix associated with model s parameters \n @xmath103 we can measure the independence between the parameters . since @xmath104 is a symmetric positive semi - definite matrix , @xmath105 , and \n the trace of the hs norm of the covariance matrix is equal to : @xmath106 = \\sum_{j=1}^p v_j^2\\nonumber\\\\ ~~&= \\sigma^4 \\operatorname{tr}[k(k+\\alpha i)^{-2 } k(k+\\alpha i)^{-2}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      kic is defined as : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the complexity term based on equation  [ eq : hs ] . \n the normalization by @xmath109 obtains a complexity measure that is robust to changes in variance ( similar to icomp criterion ) . \n the minimum kic defines the best model . ] . \n the penalized log - likelihood ( pll ) in krr for normally distribution data is defined by : @xmath110 the unknown parameters @xmath22 , and @xmath111 are calculated by minimizing the kic objective function . @xmath112 we also investigated the effect of using @xmath113 $ ] , and @xmath61 $ ] as complexity terms . \n the empirical results reported in subsection  [ subsec : realdata ] on real datasets , and compared with kic . \n we denote these information criteria as :    @xmath114,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath115.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in both kic_1 , and kic_2 , similar to kic , @xmath116 , while because the complexity term is dependent on @xmath16 , @xmath111 for kic_1 is : @xmath117=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we denote @xmath118 , @xmath111 is the solution of a quadratic optimization problem , @xmath119 , where @xmath120 . in the case of kic_2 , the @xmath111 is the real root of the following cubic problem : @xmath121 where @xmath122 $ ] . \n we compared kic with loocv @xcite , kernel - based icomp @xcite , and maximum log of marginal likelihood in gpr ( abbreviated as gpr ) @xcite to find the optimal ridge regressors . \n the reason to compare kic with icomp and gpr is that in all of these methods the complexity measure computes the interdependency of model parameters as a function of covariance matrix in different ways . \n loocv is a standard and commonly used methods for model selection . \n * loocv : * re - sampling model selection methods like cross - validation is time consuming @xcite . for instance , the leave - one - out - cross - validation ( loocv ) has the computational cost of @xmath123 the number of parameter combinations ( @xmath124 is the processing time of the model selection algorithm @xmath125 ) for @xmath126 training samples . to have cross - validation methods with faster processing time , \n the closed form formula for the risk estimators of the algorithm under special conditions are provided . \n we consider the kernel - based closed form of loocv for linear regression introduced by @xcite : @xmath127^{-1}[i - h]y\\|_2 ^ 2}{n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 is the hat matrix .    * \n maximizing the log of marginal likelihood ( gpr ) * is a kernel - based regression method . for a given training set @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , \n a multivariate gaussian distribution is defined on any function @xmath5 such that , @xmath131 , where @xmath39 is a kernel . \n marginal likelihood is used as the model selection criterion in gpr , since it balances between the lack - of - fit and complexity of a model . maximizing the log of marginal likelihood obtains the optimal parameters for model selection . \n the log of marginal likelihood is denoted as : @xmath132 where @xmath133 denotes the model s fit , @xmath134 , denotes the complexity , and @xmath135 is a normalization constant . without loss of generality in this paper gpr means the model selection criterion is used in gpr . \n * icomp : * the kernel - based icomp introduced in @xcite is an information criterion to select the models and is defined as @xmath136 , where @xmath50 , and @xmath39 elaborated in equations  [ eq : cicomp ] , and  [ eq : sigmaicomp ] . \n in this section we evaluate the performance of kic on synthetic , and real datasets , and compare with competing model selection methods . \n kic was first evaluated on the problem of approximating @xmath137 from a set of 100 points sampled at regular intervals in @xmath138 $ ] . to evaluate robustness to noise , normal random noise \n was added to the @xmath139 function at two noise - to - signal ( nsr ) ratios : @xmath140 , and @xmath141 . \n figure  [ sinc ] shows the sinc function and the perturbed datasets . \n the following experiments were conducted : ( 1 ) shows how kic balances between gof and complexity , ( 2 ) shows how kic and mse on training sets change when the sample size and the level of noise in the data change ( 3 ) investigates the effect of using different kernels , and ( 4 ) evaluates the consistency of kic in parameter selection . \n all experiments were run 100 times using randomly generated datasets , and corresponding test sets of size 1000 .    * experiment 1 . * the effect of @xmath21 on complexity , lack - of - fit and kic values was measured by setting @xmath142 , with krr models being generated using a gaussian kernel with different standard deviations , @xmath143 , computed over the 100 data points . \n the results are shown in figure  [ co_la_kic ] . the model generated with @xmath144 overfits , because it is overly complex , while @xmath145 gives a simpler model that underfits . \n as the ridge parameter @xmath21 increases , the model complexity decreases while the goodness - of - fit is adversely affected . \n kic balances between these two terms , which yields a criterion to select a model that has good generalization , as well as goodness of fit to the data . \n * experiment 2 . * the influence of training sample size was investigated by comparing sample sizes , @xmath1 , of 50 , and 100 , for a total of four sets of experiments : ( @xmath146 ) : ( @xmath147 ) , ( @xmath148 ) , ( @xmath149 ) , ( @xmath150 ) . \n the gaussian kernel was used with @xmath151 . the kic value and mean squared error ( mse , @xmath152 ) , for different @xmath153 @xmath154 is shown in figure  [ kic - mse ] . \n the data with nsr=@xmath141 has larger mse values , and larger error bars , and consequently larger kic values compared to data with nsr=@xmath140 . in both cases , kic and mse change with similar profiles with respect to @xmath21 . \n the noise and the sample size have no effect on kic for selecting the best model ( parameter @xmath21 ) . \n * experiment 3 . \n * the effect of using a gaussian kernel , @xmath155 , versus the cauchy kernel , @xmath156 , was investigated , where @xmath157 , and @xmath158 in the computation of the kernel - based model selection criteria icomp , kic , gpr , and loocv . the results are reported in figures  [ gaussian kernel ] and  [ cauchy kernel ] . \n the graphs show box plots with markers at @xmath159 , and @xmath160 of the empirical distributions of mse values . as expected , the mse of all methods is larger when nsr is high , @xmath161 , and smaller for the larger of the two training sets ( 100 samples ) . \n loocv , icomp , and kic performed comparably , and better than gpr using a gaussian kernel for data with nsr @xmath162 . in the other cases , the best results ( smallest mse ) was achieved by kic . \n all methods have smaller mse values using the gaussian kernel versus the cauchy kernel . \n gpr with the cauchy kernel obtains results comparable with kic , but with a standard deviation close to zero . \n * experiment 4 . \n * we assessed the consistency of selecting / tuning the parameters of the models in comparison with loocv . \n we considered four experiment of sample size , @xmath163 , and nsr @xmath164 . \n the parameters to tune or select are @xmath165 @xmath166 , and @xmath167 for the gaussian kernel . \n the frequency of selecting the parameters are shown in figure  [ loocv ] for loocv , and in figure  [ kic_frequency ] for kic . \n the more concentrated frequency shows the more consistent selecting criterion . \n the diagrams show that kic is more consistent in selecting the parameters rather than loocv . \n loocv is also sensitive to sample size . \n it provides a more consistent result for benchmarks with @xmath168 samples . \n +      we used three benchmarks selected from the delve datasets ( www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data ) : ( 1 ) abalone dataset ( 4177 instances , 7 dimensions ) , ( 2 ) kin - family of datasets ( 4 datasets ; 8192 instances , 8 dimensions ) , and ( 3 ) puma - family of datasets ( 4 datasets ; 8192 instances , 8 dimensions ) .    for the abalone dataset , the task is to estimate the age of abalones . \n we used normalized attributes in range [ 0,1 ] . \n the experiment is repeated 100 times to obtain the confidence interval . in each trial \n 100 samples were selected randomly as the training set and the remaining 4077 samples as the test set . \n the kin - family and puma - family datasets are realistic simulations of a robot arm taking into consideration combinations of attributes such as whether the arm movement is nonlinear ( n ) or fairly linear ( f ) , and whether the level of noise ( unpredictability ) in the data is : medium ( m ) , or high ( h ) . \n the kin - family includes : kin-8fm , kin-8fh , kin-8 nm , kin-8nh datasets , and the puma - family contains : puma-8fm , puma-8fh , puma-8 nm , and puma-8nh datasets .    in the kin - family of datasets , having the angular positions of an 8-link robot arm , the distance of the end effector of the robot arm from a starting position is predicted . the angular position of a link of the robot arm \n is predicted given the angular positions , angular velocities , and the torques of the links . \n we compared kic_1 ( [ eq : kic1 ] ) , kic_2 ( [ eq : kic2 ] ) , and kic with loocv , icomp , and gpr on the three datasets . \n the results are shown as box - plots in figures  [ abalone ] , [ kin - family ] , and  [ puma - family ] for abalone , kin - family , and puma - family datasets , respectively . \n the best results across all three datasets were achieved using kic , and the second best results were for loocv .    for the abalone dataset , comparable results were achieved for kic and loocv , that are better than icomp , and the smallest mse value obtained by sgpr . \n kic_1 , and kic_2 had similar mse values , which are larger than for the other methods .    for the kin - family datasets , except for kin-8fm , kic gets better results than gpr , icomp , and loocv . \n kic_1 , and kic_2 obtain better results than gpr , and loocv for kin-8fm , and kin-8 nm , which are datasets with medium level of noise , but larger mse value for datasets with high noise ( kin-8fh , and kin-8nh ) .    for the puma - family datasets , \n kic got the best results on all datasets except for on puma-8 nm , where the smallest mse was achieved by loocv . \n the result of kic is comparable to icomp and better than gpr for puma-8 nm dataset . \n for puma-8fm , puma-8fh , and puma-8nh , although the median of mse for loocv and gpr are comparable to kic , kic has a more significant mse ( smaller interquartile in the box bots ) . \n the median mse value for kic_1 , and kic_2 are closer to the median mse values of the other methods on puma-8fm , and puma-8 nm , where the noise level is moderate compared to puma-8fh , and puma-8nh , where the noise level is high . the sensitivity of kic_1 , and kic_2 to noise is due to the existence of variance in their formula . \n kic_2 has a larger interquartile of mse than kic_1 in datasets with high noise , which highlights the effect of @xmath109 in its formula ( equation  [ eq : kic2 ] ) rather than @xmath16 in equation  . \n we introduced a novel kernel - based information criterion ( kic ) for model selection in regression analysis . the complexity measure in kic \n is defined on a variable - wise variance which explicitly computes the interdependency of each parameter involved in the model ; whereas in methods such as kernel - based icomp and gpr , this interdependency is defined on a covariance matrix , which obscures the true contribution of the model parameters . \n we provided empirical evidence showing how kic outperforms loocv ( with kernel - based closed form formula of the estimator ) , kernel - based icomp , and gpr , on both artificial data and real benchmark datasets : abalon , kin family , and puma family . in these experiments , \n kic efficiently balances the goodness of fit and complexity of the model , is robust to noise ( although for higher noise we have larger confidence interval as expected ) and sample size , is consistent in tuning / selecting the ridge and kernel parameters , and has significantly smaller or comparable mean squared values with respect to competing methods , while yielding stronger regressors . \n the effect of using different kernels was also investigated since the definition of a proper kernel plays an important role in kernel methods . \n kic had superior performance using different kernels and for the proper one obtains smaller mse . \n this work was funded by fnsnf grants ( p1tip2_148352 , pbtip2_140015 ) . \n we want to thank arthur gretton , and zoltn szab for the fruitful discussions .",
        "abstract": "The article introduces the Kernel-based Information Criterion (KIC) for regression model selection, which uses a novel complexity measure based on variable-wise variance to evaluate parameter interdependency. KIC balances model complexity and goodness-of-fit, outperforming traditional methods like LOOCV, kernel-based ICOMP, and Gaussian Process Regression. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight KIC's robustness to noise, efficiency in parameter tuning, and ability to produce stronger, more consistent regressors."

        "article": "this work on pricing american options under proportional transaction costs goes back to the seminal discovery by @xcite that to hedge against a buyer who can exercise the option at any ( ordinary ) stopping time , the seller must in effect be protected against all mixed ( randomised ) stopping times . \n this was followed by @xcite , who established a non - constructive dual representation for the set of strategies superhedging the seller s ( though not the buyer s ) position in an american option under transaction costs . \n efficient iterative algorithms for computing the upper and lower hedging prices of the option , the hedging strategies , optimal stopping times as well as dual representations for both the seller and the buyer of an american option under transaction costs were developed by @xcite in a model with two assets , and @xcite in a multi - asset model . \n all these approaches take it for granted that the buyer can only exercise the option instantly , at an ordinary stopping time of his choosing .    by contrast , in the present paper we allow the buyer the flexibility to exercise an american option gradually , rather than all at a single time instance . though it would be difficult in practice to exercise a fraction of an option contract and to hold on to the reminder to exercise it later \n , the holder of a large portfolio of options may well choose to exercise the individual contracts on different dates if that proves beneficial . \n does this ability to exercise gradually affect the pricing bounds , hedging strategies and optimal stopping times for the buyer and/or seller ? \n perhaps surprisingly , the answer to this question is yes , it does in the presence of transaction costs . \n gradual exercise turns out to be linked to another feature , referred to as deferred solvency , which will also be studied here . \n if a temporary loss of liquidity occurs in the market , as reflected by unusually large bid - ask spreads , agents may become insolvent . \n being allowed to defer closing their positions until liquidity is restored might enable them to become solvent once again . \n this gives more leeway when constructing hedging strategies than the usual requirement that agents should remain solvent at all times . \n @xcite was the first to explore the consequences of gradual exercise and deferred solvency using a model with a single risky asset as a testing ground . in the present paper \n these ideas are developed in a systematic manner and extended to the much more general setting of the multi - asset market model with transaction costs due to @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite . \n pricing and hedging for the seller of an american option under transaction costs is a convex optimisation problem irrespective of whether instant or gradual exercise is permitted . \n however , this is not so for the buyer . in this case one has to tackle a non - convex optimisation problem for options that can only be exercised instantly . \n a very interesting consequence of gradual exercise is that pricing and hedging becomes a convex optimisation problem also for the buyer of an american option , making it possible to deploy convex duality methods . \n the convexity of the problem also makes it much easier to implement the pricing and hedging algorithms numerically . \n we will make use of this new opportunity in this paper . \n the paper is organised as follows . \n section  [ sect - multi - curr - mod ] recalls the general setting of kabanov s multi - asset model with transaction costs . in section  [ \n sect : inst - versus - grad - exe ] the hedging strategies for the buyer and seller and the corresponding option prices under gradual exercise are introduced and compared with the same notions under instant exercise \n . a toy example is set up to demonstrate that it is easier to hedge an option and that the bid - ask spread of the option prices can be narrower under gradual exercise as compared to instant exercise . in section  [ \n sect : seller ] the seller s case is studied in detail . \n the notion of deferred solvency is first discussed and linked in proposition  [ prop : am : seller : immediate - ultimate ] with the hedging problem for the seller of an american option with gradual exercise . \n the sets of seller s hedging portfolios are then constructed and related to the ask price of the option under gradual exercise and to a construction of a seller s hedging strategy realising the ask price ; see theorem  [ prop : seller : zau0=initial - endowments ] . \n a dual representation of the seller s price is established in theorem  [ thm : ask - price - representation ] . \n the toy example is revisited to illustrate the various constructions and results for the seller . \n section  [ sect : buyer ] is devoted to the buyer s case . \n buyer s hedging portfolios and strategies are constructed and used to compute the bid price of the option ; see theorem  [ prop:2012 - 07 - 26:hedging - construct ] . \n finally , the dual representation for the buyer is explored in theorem  [ th : bu - buyer ] . \n once again , the toy example serves to illustrate the results . \n a numerical example with three assets can be found in section  [ sec : num - example ] . some conclusions and possible further developments and ramifications are touched upon in section  [ sect : conclusions ] . technical information and proofs \n are collected in the appendix . \n let @xmath0 be a filtered probability space . \n we assume that @xmath1 is finite , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 for all @xmath5 . for each @xmath6 let @xmath7 be the collection of atoms of @xmath8 , called the _ nodes _ of the associated tree model . \n a node @xmath9 is said to be a _ \n successor _ of a node @xmath10 if @xmath11 . for each @xmath12 \n we denote the collection of successors of any given node @xmath10 by @xmath13 .    for each @xmath6 let @xmath14 be the collection of @xmath8-measurable @xmath15-valued random variables . \n we identify elements of @xmath16 with functions on @xmath7 whenever convenient . \n we consider the discrete - time currency model introduced by @xcite and developed further by @xcite and @xcite among others . \n the model contains @xmath17 assets or currencies . at each trading date @xmath18 and for each @xmath19 one unit of asset  @xmath20 can be obtained by exchanging @xmath21 units of asset  @xmath22 . \n we assume that the exchange rates @xmath23 are @xmath8-measurable and @xmath24 for all @xmath25 and @xmath26 . \n we say that a portfolio @xmath27 is can be _ exchanged _ into a portfolio @xmath28 at time  @xmath25 whenever there are @xmath8-measurable random variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 such that for all @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the number of units of asset  @xmath20 received as a result of exchanging some units of asset  @xmath22 .    the _ solvency cone _ \n @xmath34 is the set of portfolios that are _ solvent _ at time  @xmath25 , i.e.  the portfolios at time @xmath25 that can be exchanged into portfolios with non -

financing _ \n strategy whenever @xmath46 for all @xmath12 . note that no implicitly assumed self - financing condition is included in the definition of  @xmath44 \n .    a trading strategy @xmath45 is an _ arbitrage opportunity _ if it is self - financing , @xmath47 and there is a portfolio @xmath48 with non - negative holdings in all @xmath17 assets such that @xmath49 . \n this notion of arbitrage was considered by @xcite , and its absence is formally different but equivalent to the weak no - arbitrage condition introduced by @xcite . \n [ th:2012 - 10 - 03:ftap ] the model admits no arbitrage opportunity if and only if there exists a probability measure  @xmath50 equivalent to  @xmath51 and an @xmath15-valued @xmath50-martingale @xmath52 such that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the polar of @xmath55 ; see ( [ eq:2012 -

called _ consistent price process _ \n @xmath61 ; see @xcite . \n we also define for any @xmath62 @xmath63 in the absence of arbitrage @xmath54 is a non - empty compactly @xmath64-generated polyhedral cone for all @xmath25 ( * ? ? ? \n * remark  2.2 ) , which means that @xmath65 . \n ( for the definition of a compactly @xmath64-generated cone , see appendix  [ subsect : comp - gen - cones ] . ) \n the payoff of an american option in the model with @xmath17 underlying currencies is , in general , an @xmath15-valued adapted process @xmath66 . \n the seller of the american option is obliged to deliver , and the buyer is entitled to receive the portfolio of currencies @xmath67 at a stopping time @xmath68 chosen by the buyer . here @xmath69 denotes the family of stopping times with values in @xmath70 . \n this is the usual setup in which the option is exercised _ instantly _ at a stopping time  @xmath68 . \n american options with the provision for instant exercise in the multi - currency model under proportional transaction costs have been studied by @xcite , who established a non - constructive characterisation of the superhedging strategies for the option seller only , and by @xcite , who provided computationally efficient iterative constructions of the ask and bid option prices and the superhedging strategies for both the option seller and buyer .    in the present paper \n we relax the requirement that the option needs to be exercised instantly at a stopping time @xmath68 . \n instead , we allow the buyer to exercise _ gradually _ at a mixed stopping time @xmath71 . \n ( for the definition of mixed stopping times , see appendix  [ sect : mixed - stop - times ] . ) \n if the buyer chooses to exercise the option gradually according to a mixed stopping time @xmath71 , then the seller of the american option will be obliged to deliver , and the buyer will be entitled to receive the fraction  @xmath72 of the portfolio of currencies  @xmath73 at each time @xmath6 .    the question then arises whether or not it would be more beneficial for the buyer to exercise the option gradually rather than instantly ? what will be the optimal mixed stopping time @xmath71 for the buyer ? \n how should the seller hedge against gradual exercise ? \n are the ask ( seller s ) and bid ( buyer s ) option prices and hedging strategies affected by gradual exercise as compared to instant exercise ?      in the case of instant exercise the seller of an american option  @xmath74 needs to hedge by means of a trading strategy  @xmath45 against all ordinary stopping times @xmath68 chosen by the buyer . the trading strategy  @xmath75 needs to be self - financing up to time  @xmath76 and to allow the seller to remain solvent on delivering the portfolio @xmath67 at time  @xmath76 , for any  @xmath68 . hence the family of seller s superhedging strategies \n is defined as @xmath77 and the _ ask price _ ( _ seller s price _ ) of the option in currency @xmath62 is @xmath78 this is the smallest amount in currency  @xmath64 needed to superhedge a short position in  @xmath74 .    on the other hand , the buyer of an american option  @xmath74 can select both a stopping time  @xmath68 and a trading strategy  @xmath45 . \n the trading strategy  @xmath75 needs to be self - financing up to time  @xmath76 and to allow the buyer to remain solvent on receiving the portfolio @xmath67 at time  @xmath76 . \n thus , the family of buyer s superhedging strategies is defined as @xmath79 and the _ bid price _ ( _ buyer s price _ ) of the option in currency @xmath62 is @xmath80 this is the largest amount in currency  @xmath64 that the buyer can raise using the option  @xmath74 as surety .    for american options with instant exercise , iterative constructions of the ask and bid option prices @xmath81 and @xmath82 and the corresponding seller s and buyer s superhedging strategies from @xmath83 and @xmath84 were established by @xcite . \n when the buyer is allowed to exercise gradually , the seller needs to follow a suitable trading strategy to hedge his exposure . \n since the seller can react to the buyer s actions , this strategy may in general depend on the mixed stopping time @xmath71 followed by the buyer , and will be denoted by @xmath85 . in other words \n , we consider a function @xmath86 .    at each time \n @xmath25 the seller will be holding a portfolio @xmath87 and will be obliged to deliver a fraction @xmath72 of the payoff @xmath73 . \n he can then rebalance the remaining portfolio @xmath88 into @xmath89 in a self - financing manner , so that @xmath90the self - financing and superhedging conditions have merged into one . \n we call ( [ eq : seller - self - fin - superhedge ] ) the _ rebalancing _ condition . \n when creating the portfolio @xmath87 at time  @xmath43 , the seller can only use information available at that time . \n this includes @xmath91 , but the seller has no way of knowing the future values @xmath92 that will be chosen by the buyer . \n the trading strategies @xmath85 that can be adopted by the seller are therefore restricted to those satisfying the _ non - anticipation _ \n condition @xmath93 in particular , the initial endowment @xmath94 of the trading strategy @xmath95 is the same for all @xmath71 . \n we denote this common value by  @xmath96 . \n we define the family of seller s superhedging strategies against gradual exercise by @xmath97 and the corresponding _ ask price _ ( _ seller s price _ ) of the option in currency @xmath98 by @xmath99 this is the smallest amount in currency  @xmath22 that the seller needs to superhedge a short position in the american option  @xmath74 when the buyer is allowed to exercise gradually .    on the other hand , \n the buyer is able to select both a mixed stopping time @xmath71 and a trading strategy @xmath45 , and will be taking delivery of a fraction  @xmath72 of the payoff  @xmath73 at each time  @xmath25 . because the choice of the mixed stopping time  @xmath100 is up to the buyer , the trading strategy @xmath75 needs to be good just for the one chosen stopping time , and does not need to be considered as a function of  @xmath100 , in contrast to the seller s case . \n the _ rebalancing _ \n condition @xmath101 needs to be satisfied . \n hence , the family of superhedging strategies for the buyer of an american option  @xmath74 with gradual exercise is defined as @xmath102 and the corresponding _ bid price _ ( _ buyer s price _ ) of the option in currency @xmath98 is @xmath103 this is the largest amount in currency  @xmath22 that can be raised using the option as surety by a buyer who is able to exercise gradually . \n [ exl : new]we consider a toy example with two assets , a foreign currency ( asset 1 ) and domestic currency ( asset 2 ) in a two -

        "abstract": "This paper studies American options under proportional transaction costs, allowing gradual exercise at mixed stopping times rather than instant exercise. Gradual exercise leads to tighter price bounds, improving bid and ask price estimates compared to traditional models. The research develops algorithms to calculate these prices, constructs optimal hedging strategies, and establishes dual representations for buyers and sellers. Numerical examples illustrate the practical implementation, showing that gradual exercise simplifies pricing and hedging as convex optimization problems for both parties."

        "article": "in the last years wireless communication systems coped with the problem of delivering reliable information while granting high throughput . this problem has often been faced resorting to channel codes able to correct errors even at low signal to noise ratios . \n as pointed out in table i in @xcite , several standards for wireless communications adopt binary or double binary turbo codes @xcite and exploit their excellent error correction capability . \n however , due to the high computational complexity required to decode turbo codes , optimized architectures ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) have been usually employed . moreover \n , several works addressed the parallelization of turbo decoder architectures to achieve higher throughput . \n in particular , many works concentrate on avoiding , or reducing , the collision phenomenon that arises with parallel architectures ( e.g. @xcite ) . \n although throughput and area have been the dominant metrics driving the optimization of turbo decoders , recently , the need for flexible systems able to support different operative modes , or even different standards , has changed the perspective . in particular , \n the so called software defined radio ( sdr ) paradigm made flexibility a fundamental property @xcite of future receivers , which will be requested to support a wide range of heterogeneous standards . \n some recent works ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) deal with the implementation of application - specific instruction - set processor ( asip ) architectures for turbo decoders . in order to obtain architectures that achieve both high throughput and flexibility \n multi - asip is an effective solution . \n thus , together with flexible and high throughput processing elements , a multi - asip architecture must feature also a flexible and high throughput interconnection backbone . to that purpose \n , the network - on - chip ( noc ) approach has been proposed to interconnect processing elements in turbo decoder architectures designed to support multiple standards @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in addition , noc based turbo decoder architectures have the intrinsic feature of adaptively reducing the communication bandwidth by the inhibition of unnecessary extrinsic information exchange . \n this can be obtained by exploiting bit - level reliability - based criteria where unnecessary iterations for reliable bits are avoided @xcite .    in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ring , \n chordal ring and random graph topologies are investigated whereas in @xcite previous works are extended to mesh and toroidal topologies . \n furthermore , in @xcite butterfly and benes topologies are studied , and in @xcite binary de - bruijn topologies are considered . however , none of these works presents a unified framework to design a noc based turbo decoder , showing possible complexity / performance trade - offs . \n this work aims at filling this gap and provides two novel contributions in the area of flexible turbo decoders : i ) a comprehensive study of noc based turbo decoders , conducted by means of a dedicated noc simulator ; ii ) a list of obtained results , showing the complexity / performance trade - offs offered by different topologies , routing algorithms , node and asip architectures . \n the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : system_analysis ] the requirements and characteristics of a parallel turbo decoder architecture are analyzed , whereas in section [ sec : noc ] noc based approach is introduced . \n section [ sec : topologies ] summarizes the topologies considered in previous works and introduces generalized de - bruijn and generalized kautz topologies as promising solutions for noc based turbo decoder architectures . in section [ sec : ra ] three main routing algorithms are introduced , whereas in section [ sec : tnoc ] the turbo noc framework is described . \n section [ sec : routing_algo_arch ] describes the architecture of the different routing algorithms considered in this work , section [ sec : results ] presents the experimental results and section [ sec : concl ] draws some conclusions . \n a parallel turbo decoder can be modeled as @xmath0 processing elements that need to read from and write to @xmath0 memories . each processing element , \n often referred to as soft - in - soft - out ( siso ) module , performs the bcjr algorithm @xcite , whereas the memories are used for exchanging the extrinsic information @xmath1 among the sisos . \n the decoding process is iterative and usually each siso performs sequentially the bcjr algorithm for the two constituent codes used at the encoder side ; for further details on the siso module the reader can refer to @xcite . as a consequence , each iteration is made of two half iterations referred to as interleaving and de - interleaving . during one half iteration the extrinsic information produced by siso @xmath2 at time @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is sent to the memory @xmath5 at the location @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are functions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 derived from the permutation law ( @xmath9 or interleaver ) employed at the encoder side . \n thus , the time required to complete the decoding is directly related to the number of clock cycles necessary to complete a half iteration . without loss of generality , we can express the number of cycles required to complete a half iteration ( @xmath10 ) as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total number of trellis steps in a data frame , @xmath13 is the number of trellis steps processed by each siso , @xmath14 is the siso output rate , namely the number of trellis steps processed by a siso in a clock cycle , and @xmath15 is the interconnection structure latency . \n thus , the decoder throughput expressed as the number of decoded bits over the time required to complete the decoding process is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the clock frequency , @xmath18 is the number of iterations , @xmath19 for binary codes and @xmath20 for double binary codes . when the interconnection structure latency is negligible with respect to the number of cycles required by the siso , we obtain @xmath21        thus , to achieve a target throughput @xmath22 and satisfactory error rate performance , a proper number @xmath23 of iterations should be used . \n the minimum @xmath0 ( @xmath24 ) to satisfy @xmath22 with @xmath23 iterations can be estimated from ( [ eq : tapprox ] ) for some asip architectures available in the literature . \n if we consider @xmath25 , as in @xcite , @xcite , @xmath0 ranges in [ 5 , 37 ] to achieve @xmath26 mb / s ( see table [ tab : pasip ] ) . \n it is worth pointing out that the @xmath27 values in table [ tab : pasip ] represent the average numbers of cycles required by the siso to update the soft information of one bit ( see table vi in @xcite and table i in @xcite ) . \n moreover , @xmath28 strongly depends on the internal architecture of the siso and in general tends to increase with the code complexity . as a consequence , \n several conditions can further increase @xmath0 , namely 1 ) interconnection structures with larger @xmath15 ; 2 ) higher @xmath29 values ; 3 ) higher @xmath22 ; 4 ) higher @xmath23 ; 5 ) lower clock frequency . \n thus , we consider as relevant for investigation a slightly wider range for @xmath0 : @xmath30 . \n .parallelism degree required to obtain @xmath26 mb / s for @xmath25 with some asip architectures available in the literature [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the area and the percentage are not really zero , but they are negligible compared with the i m and lm contribution to the total area . \n the most important conclusions that can be derived from results in table [ tab : wimax_results ] and [ tab : mhoms_results ] are :    1 . \n the asp - ft routing algorithm is the best performing solution both in terms of throughput and area when @xmath31 . \n 2 .   the routing memory overhead of the asp - ft algorithm ( see fig . \n [ fig : node ] ( b ) ) becomes relevant as @xmath14 decreases and ssp solutions become the best solutions mainly for @xmath32 and @xmath33 . \n 3 .   in most cases topologies with @xmath34=4 achieve higher throughput with lower complexity overhead than topologies with @xmath34=2 when @xmath35 . \n 4 .   in most cases , generalized de - bruijn and generalized kautz topologies are the best performing topologies .    as a significant example , in fig . \n [ fig : r1_asp - ft ] , we show the experimental results obtained with @xmath31 and asp - ft routing algorithm for the wimax interleaver with @xmath36 ( a ) and the circular shifting interleaver with @xmath37 ( b ) . \n each point represents the throughtput and the area obtained for a certain topology with a certain parallelism degree @xmath0 . \n results referred to the same @xmath0 value are bounded into the same box and a label is assigned to each point to highlight the corresponding topology , namely topologies are identified as r - ring , h - honeycomb , t - toroidal mesh , k - generalized kautz with the corresponding @xmath34 value ( k2 , k3 , k4 ) . \n as it can be observed , generalized kautz topologies with @xmath38 ( k4 ) are always the best solutions to achieve high throughput with minimum area overhead .    in fig . \n [ fig : tar_tot ] significant results extracted from table [ tab : wimax_results ] and [ tab : mhoms_results ] are shown in graphical form . \n in particular , for @xmath31 the asp - ft routing algorithm is the best solution , whereas for @xmath39 ssp routing algorithms , implemented as in fig . \n [ fig : node ] ( c ) , tend to achieve the same performance as the asp - ft routing algorithm with lower complexity overhead ( see fig . [ \n fig : tar_tot ] ( a ) and ( b ) for the wimax interleaver , @xmath36 and fig . \n [ fig : tar_tot ] ( c ) and ( d ) for the circular shifting interleaver , @xmath37 ) . \n an interesting phenomenon that arises increasing the interleaver size is the performance saturation that can be observed in the table [ tab : mhoms_results ] for @xmath40 topologies , namely the throughput tends to saturate and increasing @xmath14 has the effect of augmenting the area with a negligible increase or even with a decrease of throughput . as an example , the generalized kautz topology with @xmath41 and asp - ft routing algorithm achieves more than 180 mb / s with @xmath31 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 . \n however , the solution with the smallest area is the one obtained with @xmath43 . \n the throughput flattening of low @xmath34 topologies can be explained by observing that high values of @xmath14 tend to saturate the network . \n furthermore , high values of @xmath14 lengthen the input fifos as highlighted in table [ tab : percentage ] , where the total area of the network is given as the breakdown of the building blocks , namely the input fifos , the crossbars ( cb ) , the output registers , the routing algorithm / memory ( ra / m ) , the identifier memory ( i m ) and the location memory ( lm ) is given for some significant cases : the highest throughput ( light - gray ) , the highest area ( mid - gray ) , and lowest area ( dark - gray ) points for each @xmath34 value in table [ tab : mhoms_results ] . \n in this work a general framework to design network on chip based turbo decoder architectures has been presented . \n the proposed framework can be adapted to explore different topologies , degrees of parallelism , message injection rates and routing algorithms . \n experimental results show that generalized de - bruijn and generalized kautz topologies achieve high throughput with a limited complexity overhead . \n moreover , depending on the target throughput requirements different parallelism degrees , message injection rates and routing algorithms can be used to minimize the network area overhead . \n a.  giulietti , l.  v. der perre , and m.  strum , `` parallel turbo coding interleavers : avoiding collisions in accesses to storage elements , '' _ iet electronics letters _ , vol . \n 38 , no .  5 , pp . 232234 , feb 2002 . \n m.  j. thul , f.  gilbert , and n.  wehn , `` optimized concurrent interleaving architecture for high - throughput turbodecoding , '' in _ ieee international conference on electronics , circuits and systems _ , 2002 , pp . 10991102 . \n c.  neeb , m.  j. thul , and n.  wehn , `` network - on - chip - centric approach to interleaving in high throughput channel decoders , '' in _ ieee international symposium on circuits and systems _ \n , 2005 , pp . 17661769 . \n h.  moussa , o.  muller , a.  baghdadi , and m.  .jezequel , `` butterfly and benes - based on - chip communication networks for multiprocessor turbo decoding , '' in _ design , automation and test in europe conference and exhibition _ \n , 2007 , pp . 654659 . \n s.  benedetto , d.  divsalar , g.  montorsi , and f.  pollara , `` soft - input soft - output modules for the construction and distributed iterative decoding of code networks , '' _ \n european transactions on telecommunications _ , vol .  9 , no .  2 , pp . 155172 , mar / apr 1998 . \n o.  muller , a.  baghdadi , and m.  jezequel , `` asip - based multiprocessor soc design for simple and double binary turbo decoding , '' in _ design , automation and test in europe conference and exhibition _ \n , 2006 , pp . 13301335 . \n o.  muller , a.  baghdadi , and m.  jezequel , `` exploring parallel processing levels for convolutional turbo decoding , '' in _ ieee international conference on information and communication technologies : from theory to applications _ \n , 2006 , pp .",

        "article": "monte carlo methods @xcite appeared about sixty years ago with the need to evaluate numerical values for various complex problems . \n these methods evolved and were applied early to quantum problems , thus putting within reach exact numerical solutions to non - trivial quantum problems @xcite . \n many improvements of these methods followed , avoiding critical slowing down near phase transitions and allowing to work directly in the continuous imaginary time limit @xcite . in recent years , \n interest in methods that work in the canonical ensemble with global updates yet allow access to green functions has intensified @xcite . \n however , a method that works well for a given hamiltonian often needs major modifications for another . \n for example , the addition of a 4-site ring exchange term in the bosonic hubbard model required special developments for a treatment by the stochastic series expansion algorithm @xcite , as well as by the wordline algorithm @xcite . \n this can result in long delays . \n it is , therefore , advantageous to have at one s disposal an algorithm that can be applied to a very wide class of hamiltonians without requiring any changes . in a recent publication @xcite , \n the stochastic green function ( sgf ) algorithm was presented , which meets this goal . \n the algorithm can be applied to any lattice hamiltonian of the form @xmath3 where @xmath1 is diagonal in the chosen occupation number basis and @xmath2 has only positive matrix elements . \n this includes all kinds of systems that can be treated by other methods presented in ref.@xcite , for instance bose - hubbard models with or without a trap , bose - fermi mixtures in one dimension , heisenberg models ... in particular hamiltonians for which the non - diagonal part @xmath2 is non - trivial ( the eigen - basis is unknown ) are easily treated , such as the bose - hubbard model with ring exchange @xcite , or multi - species hamiltonians in which a given species can be turned into another one ( see eq.([twospecies ] ) and fig . \n [ density ] and [ momentum ] for a concrete example ) . \n systems for which it is not possible to find a basis in which @xmath1 is diagonal and @xmath2 has only positive matrix elements are said to have a `` sign problem '' , which usually arises with fermionic and frustrated systems . as other qmc methods , the sgf algorithm does not solve this problem .    the algorithm allows to measure several quantities of interest , such as the energy , the local density , local compressibility , density - density correlation functions ... in particular the winding is sampled and gives access to the superfluid density . \n equal - time n - body green functions are probably the most interesting quantities that can be measured by the algorithm , by giving access to momentum distribution functions which allow direct comparisons with experiments . \n all details on measurements are given in ref.@xcite . \n in addition the algorithm has the property of being easy to code , due in part to a simple update scheme in which all moves are accepted with a probability of 1 . despite of such generality and simplicity , \n the algorithm might suffer from a reduced efficiency , compared to other algorithms in situations where they can be applied . \n the purpose of this paper is to present a `` directed '' update scheme that ( i ) keeps the simplicity and generality of the original sgf algorithm , and ( ii ) enhances its efficiency by improving the sampling over the imaginary time axis . \n while the sgf algorithm is not intended to compete with the speed of other algorithms , the improvment resulting from the directed update scheme is remarkable ( see section v ) . \n but what makes the strength of the sgf method is that it allows to simulate hamiltonians that can not be treated by other methods or that would require special developments ( see eq.([twospecies ] ) for a concrete example ) . \n the paper is organized as follows : we introduce in section ii the notations and definitions used in ref.@xcite . in section iii , we propose a simplification of the update scheme used in the original sgf algorithm , and determine how to satisfy detailed balance . \n a generalization of the simplified update scheme is presented in section iv , which constitutes the directed updated scheme . \n finally section v shows how to determine the introduced optimization parameters , and presents some tests of the algorithm and a comparison with the original version . \n in this section , we recall the expression of the `` green operator '' introduced in the sgf algorithm , and the extended partition function which is considered . although not required for understanding this paper , we refer the reader to ref.@xcite for full details on the algorithm . as many qmc algorithms , \n the sgf algorithm samples the partition function @xmath4 the algorithm has the property of working in the canonical ensemble . in order to define the green operator , \n we first define the `` normalized '' creation and annihilation operators , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the usual creation and annihilation operators of bosons , and @xmath8 is the number operator . from ( [ normalizedoperators ] ) \n one can show the following relations for any state @xmath9 in the occupation number representation , @xmath10 with the particular case @xmath11 . \n appart from this exception , the operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 change a state @xmath9 by respectively creating and annihilating one particle , but they do not change the norm of the state .    using the notation @xmath14 to denote two subsets of site indices @xmath15 and @xmath16 with the constraint that all indices in subset @xmath17 are different from the indices in subset @xmath18 ( but several indices in one subset may be equal ) , we define the green operator @xmath19 by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a matrix that depends on the application of the algorithm @xcite . in order to sample the partition function ( [ partitionfunction ] ) , an extended partition function @xmath22 is considered by breaking up the propagator @xmath23 , and introducing the green operator between the broken parts , @xmath24 defining the time dependant operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 \n , @xmath27 and working in the occupation number basis in which @xmath1 is diagonal , the extended partition function takes the form @xmath28 where the sum @xmath29 implicitly runs over complete sets of states @xmath30 . we will systematically use the labels @xmath31 and @xmath32 to denote the states appearing on the left and the right of the green operator , and use the notation @xmath33 to denote the diagonal energy @xmath34 . \n we will also denote by @xmath35 and @xmath36 the time indices of the @xmath2 operators appearing on the left and the right of @xmath19 .    as a result , \n the extended partition function is a sum over all possible configurations , each being determined by a set of time indices @xmath37 and a set of states @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40,@xmath41 , @xmath42 . \n the algorithm consists in updating those configurations by making use of the green operator . assuming that the green operator is acting at time @xmath43 \n , it can `` create '' a @xmath2 operator ( that is to say a @xmath2 operator can be inserted in the operator string ) at the same time , thus introducing a new intermediate state , then it can be shifted to a different time . while shifting , any @xmath2 operator encountered by the green operator is `` destroyed '' ( that is to say removed from the operator string ) . assuming a left ( or right ) move , creating an operator will update the state @xmath44 ( or @xmath41 ) , \n while destroying will update the state @xmath41 ( or @xmath44 ) . \n when a diagonal configuration of the green operator occurs , @xmath45 , such a configuration associated to the extended partition function ( [ extendedpartitionfunction ] ) is also a configuration associated to the partition function ( [ partitionfunction ] ) . \n measurements can be done when this occurs ( see ref.@xcite for details on measurements ) . \n next section presents a simple update scheme that meets the requirements of ergodicity and detailed balance . \n before introducing the directed update , we start by simplifying the update scheme used in the original sgf algorithm \n .      we will assume in the following that a left move of the green operator is chosen . \n in the original version , the green operator @xmath26 can choose to create or not on its right a @xmath2 operator at time @xmath43 . \n then a time shift @xmath46 to the left is chosen for the green operator with an exponential distribution in the range @xmath47 . \n if an operator is encountered while shifting the green operator , then the operator is destroyed and the move stops there . as a result , four possible situations can occur during one move :    1 .   no creation , shift , no destruction . \n 2 .   creation , shift , no destruction . \n 3 .   no creation , shift , destruction . \n 4 .   creation , shift , destruction . \n it appears that the first possibility `` no creation , no destruction '' is actually useless , since no change is performed in the operator string . the idea is to get rid of this possibility by forcing the green operator to destroy an operator if no creation is chosen \n a further simplification can be done by noticing that the last possibility `` creation , destruction '' is not necessary for the ergodicity of the algorithm , and can be avoided by restricting the range of the time shift after having created an operator . \n therefore we replace the original update scheme by the following : we assume that the green operator is acting at time @xmath43 and that the operator on its left is acting at time @xmath35 . the green operator @xmath26 chooses to create or not an operator on its right at time @xmath43 . \n if creation is chosen , then a time shift @xmath46 of the green operator is chosen to the left in the range @xmath48 , with the probability distribution defined below . \n if no creation is chosen , then the green operator is directly shifted to the operator on its left at time @xmath35 , and the operator is destroyed . as a result \n only two possibilities have to be considered :    1 . \n creation , shift . \n 2 .   shift , destruction . \n figure [ simplfiedupdatescheme ] shows the associated organigram . \n section iii.b explains how detailed balance can be satisfied with this simplified update scheme .          when updating the configurations according to the chosen update scheme , we need to generate different transitions from initial to final states with probabilities that satisfy detailed balance . in this section \n we propose a choice for these probabilities , and determine the corresponding acceptance factors . \n we denote the probability of the initial ( final ) configuration by @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) . \n we denote by @xmath51 the probability of the transition from configuration @xmath17 to configuration @xmath52 , and by @xmath53 the probability of the reverse transition . \n finally we denote by @xmath54 the acceptance rate of the transition from @xmath17 to @xmath52 , and by @xmath55 the acceptance rate of the reverse transition . \n the detailed balance can be written as @xmath56 we will make use of the metropolis solution @xcite , @xmath57 with @xmath58 we will use primed ( non - primed ) labels for states and time indices to denote final ( initial ) configurations . \n we consider here the case where a left move is chosen , an operator is created on the right of the green operator at time @xmath43 , and a new state is chosen . \n then a time shift to the left is chosen for the green operator in the range @xmath59 . \n it is important to note that @xmath60 and @xmath61 correspond to the time indices of the operators appearing on the left and the right of the green operator after the new operator has been inserted , that is to say at the moment where the time shift needs to be performed . \n thus we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 . \n the probability of the initial configuration is the boltzmann weight appearing in the extended partition function ( [ extendedpartitionfunction ] ) : @xmath64 the probability of the final configuration takes the form : @xmath65 it is important here to realize that the green operator only inserted on its right the operator @xmath66 , before being shifted from @xmath61 to @xmath67 . \n therefore we have the equalities @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 . \n the probability @xmath51 of the transition from the initial configuration to the final configuration is the probability @xmath72 of a left move , times the probability @xmath73 of a creation , times the probability @xmath74 to choose the new state @xmath75 , times the probability @xmath76 to shift the green operator by @xmath77 , knowing that the states on the left and the right of the green operator at the moment of the shift are @xmath78 and @xmath79 : @xmath80 the probability of the reverse transition is simply the probability @xmath81 of a right move , times the probability of no creation , @xmath82 : @xmath83\\ ] ] from the original version of the sgf algorithm , we know that choosing the time shift with an exponential distribution is a good choice , because it cancels the exponentials appearing in the probabilities of the initial ( [ initial ] ) and final ( [ final ] ) configurations , avoiding exponentially small acceptance factors . \n however a different normalization must be used here , since the time shift is chosen in the range @xmath84 instead of @xmath47 . \n the suitable solution is : @xmath85 it is straightforward to check that the above probability is correctly normalized and well - defined for any real value of @xmath86 , the particular case @xmath87 reducing to the uniform distribution @xmath88 ( note that @xmath89 is always a positive number ) . for the probability @xmath74 to choose the new state @xmath75 , \n the convenient solution is the same as in the original version : @xmath90 putting everything together , the acceptance factor ( [ metropolis2 ] ) becomes @xmath91\\big[1-e^{-(\\tau_l^\\prime-\\tau_r^\\prime)(v_r^\\prime - v_l^\\prime)}\\big]}{v_r^\\prime - v_l^\\prime},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the notation @xmath92 to emphasize that this acceptance factor corresponds to a creation . \n it is also important for the remaining of this paper to note that @xmath92 is written as a quantity that depends on the initial configuration , times a quantity that depends on the final configuration . \n we consider here the case where a left move is chosen , and the operator on the left of the green operator is destroyed . \n this move corresponds to the inverse of the above `` creation , shift '' move . \n thus , the corresponding acceptance factor @xmath93 is obtained by inverting the acceptance factor @xmath92 , exchanging the initial time @xmath43 and final time @xmath67 , and switching the direction . \n however @xmath94 represents an absolute time shift , so @xmath35 and @xmath36 do not have to be exchanged . \n we get @xmath95\\big[1-e^{-(\\tau_l-\\tau_r)(v_l - v_r)}\\big ] } \\\\                             & \\times & \\frac{\\big\\langle\\psi_l^\\prime\\big|\\hat\\mathcal g\\big|\\psi_r^\\prime\\big\\rangle p(\\rightarrow^\\prime)p_\\rightarrow^\\dagger(\\tau^\\prime)}{\\big\\langle\\psi_l^\\prime\\big|\\hat\\mathcal t\\hat\\mathcal g\\big|\\psi_r^\\prime\\big\\rangle},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is written as a quantity that depends on the initial configuration , times a quantity that depends on the final configuration . \n we will use here the short notation @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 to denote respectively the quantities @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 . as in ref . \n @xcite , we have some freedom for the choice of the probabilities of choosing a left or right move , @xmath72 and @xmath102 , and the probabilities of creation @xmath73 and @xmath103 . \n a suitable choice for those probabilities can be done in order to accept all moves , resulting in an appreciable simplification of the algorithm . for this purpose , \n we impose the acceptance factor @xmath92 ( or @xmath104 ) to be equal to the acceptance factor @xmath93 ( or @xmath105 ) . \n this allows to determine the probabilities @xmath73 and @xmath103 , @xmath106 and the acceptance factors @xmath107 and @xmath108 take the form @xmath109 with @xmath110 finally we can impose the acceptance factors @xmath111 and @xmath112 to be equal . \n this implies @xmath113 defining @xmath114 , we are left with a single acceptance factor , @xmath115 which is independent of the chosen direction , and independent of the nature of the move ( creation or destruction ) . \n thus all moves can be accepted by making use of a proper reweighting , as explained in ref . \n the appendix shows how to generate random numbers with the appropriate exponential distribution ( [ exponentialdistribution ] ) .      although the above simplified update scheme works , it turns out to have a poor efficiency . \n this is because of a lack of `` directionality '' : the green operator has , in average , a probability of @xmath116 to choose a left move or a right move . \n therefore the green operator propagates along the operator string like a `` drunk man '' , with a diffusion - like law . \n the basic creation and destruction processes correspond to the steps of the random walk . \n this suggests that the efficiency of the update scheme can be improved if one can force the green operator to move in the same direction for several iterations . \n next section presents a modified version of the simplified update scheme , which allows to control the mean length of the steps of the random walk , that is to say the mean number of creations and destructions in a given direction . \n the proposed directed update scheme can be considered analogous to the `` directed loop update '' used in the stochastic series expansion algorithm @xcite , which prevents a worm from going backwards . \n however the connection should not be pushed too far . \n indeed the picture of a worm whose head is evolving both in space and imaginary time accross vertices is obvious in a loop algorithm . in such algorithm , \n a creation ( or an annihilation ) operator which is represented by the head of a worm is propagated both in space and imaginary time , while an annihilation ( or a creation ) operator represented by the tail of the worm remains at rest . \n the loop ends when the head of the worm bites the tail . \n such a worm picture is not obvious in the sgf algorithm : instead of single creation or annihilation operators , it is the full green operator over the whole space that is propagated only in imaginary time . \n this creates open worldlines , thus introducing discontinuities . \n these discontinuities increase or decrease while propagating in imaginary time . \n all open ends of the worldlines are localized at the same imaginary time index . \n therefore it is actually not possible to draw step by step a worm whose head is evolving in space and imaginary time until it bites its tail . \n we present in this section a directed update scheme which is obtained by modifying slightly the simplified update scheme , thus keeping the simplicity and generality of the algorithm .      assuming that a left move is chosen \n , the green operator chooses between starting the move by a creation or a destruction . after having created ( or destroyed ) an operator , the green operator can choose to keep moving in the same direction and destroy ( or create ) with a probability @xmath117 ( or @xmath118 ) , or to stop . \n if it keeps moving , then a destruction ( or creation ) occurs , and the green operator can choose to keep moving and create ( or destroy ) with a probability @xmath118 ( or @xmath117 ) ... and so on , until it decides to stop . if the last action of the move is a creation , then a time shift is chosen . \n the organigram is represented in figure [ directedupdatescheme ] .          in order to satisfy detailed balance , in addition to the acceptance factors @xmath92 and @xmath93 , we need to determine new acceptance factors of the form @xmath119 and @xmath120 . \n we first determine the new expressions of @xmath92 and @xmath93 resulting from the directed update scheme . for @xmath92 , \n the previous probability @xmath51 has to be multiplied by the probability to stop the move after having created , @xmath121 . \n the previous probability @xmath53 has to be multiplied by the probability to stop the move after having destroyed , @xmath122 . \n we get for @xmath92 and @xmath93 the new expressions : @xmath123}{\\big\\langle\\psi_l\\big|\\hat\\mathcal g\\big|\\psi_r\\big\\rangle p(\\leftarrow)p_\\leftarrow^\\dagger(\\tau ) }

right of the green operator , and a new state is chosen . \n then the operator on the left of the green operator is destroyed . using the superscripts @xmath124 to denote intermediate configurations

the acceptance factor @xmath92 ( or @xmath93 ) and the intermediate factors @xmath165 and @xmath166 .    in the same manner , the acceptance factors of the form @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 ( or

\n a proper choice of these probabilities can be done in order to allow us to accept all moves , simplicity and generality being the leitmotiv of the sgf algorithm .    for this purpose \n , we impose to all acceptance factors corresponding to left ( or right ) moves to be equal . \n this requires the intermediate acceptance factors @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( or @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) to be equal to 1 . \n this is realized if @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are optimization parameters belonging to @xmath184 . by tuning these parameters , the mean length of the steps of the green operator \n can be controlled . \n note that we have explicitly excluded @xmath185 from the allowed values for these optimization parameters . \n this is necessary for the green operator to have a chance to end in a diagonal configuration , @xmath45 . \n indeed , the choice @xmath186 would systematically lead to values of @xmath185 for the probabilities @xmath187 and @xmath188 for diagonal configurations . \n therefore the green operator would never stop in a diagonal configution , and no measurement could be done . \n it is important here to note that the quantities @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 are evaluated between the states on the left and the right of the green operator that are present at the moment where those quantities are needed , as well as for the times indices @xmath189 and @xmath190 and the potentials @xmath191 and @xmath192 . \n all acceptance factors corresponding to a given direction of propagation become equal if we choose for the creation probabilities : @xmath193(v_l - v_r)}{\\big[1-p_\\rightarrow^{kc}\\big]\\big[1-e^{-(\\tau_l-\\tau_r)(v_l - v_r)}\\big ] } } \\\\    & &

factors become independant of the direction of propagation if we choose @xmath194 and @xmath195 with @xmath196\\frac{\\big\\langle\\hat\\mathcal g\\hat\\mathcal

maximum of simplicity of the algorithm . \n we still have some freedom for the choice of the optimization parameters @xmath182 and @xmath183 . \n this is discussed in next section . \n from the central limit theorem , we know that the errorbar associated to any measured quantity must decrease as the square root of the number of measurements , or equivalently , the square root of the time of the simulation \n . therefore it makes sense to define the efficiency @xmath197 of a qmc algorithm by @xmath198 where @xmath199 represents the set of all optimization parameters of the algorithm , @xmath200 is the measured quantity of interest , @xmath201 is the time of the simulation , and @xmath202 is the errorbar associated to the measured quantity @xmath200 . \n this definition ensures that @xmath197 is independent of the time of the simulation . as a result , \n the larger @xmath197 the more efficient the algorithm .    in the present case \n we have @xmath203 , while @xmath204 for the original sgf algorithm . \n it is useful here to realize that , by symmetry , the mean values of @xmath118 and @xmath177 ( and @xmath117 and @xmath178 ) must be equal . \n therefore we define @xmath205 and @xmath206 . \n it seems reasonable to impose a condition of uniform sampling , @xmath207 . \n this condition can be satisfied by adjusting dynamically the values of @xmath182 and @xmath183 during the thermalization process . for this purpose \n we introduce a new optimization parameter @xmath208 and apply the following algorithm from time to time while thermalizing ( we start with @xmath209 ) : @xmath210 thus we are left with the optimization parameter @xmath211 . in order to determine the optimal value , \n we have considered 2 different hamiltonians @xmath212 and @xmath213 , and evaluated the efficiency of the algorithm while scanning @xmath211 . \n the first hamiltonian we have considered describes free hardcore bosons and is exactly solvable , @xmath214 where the sum runs over pairs of first neighboring sites and @xmath215 is the hopping parameter . \n the second hamiltonian is highly non - trivial and describes a mixture of atoms and diatomic molecules , with a special term allowing conversions between the two species @xcite , @xmath216 where @xmath217 and @xmath218 ( @xmath219 and @xmath220 ) are the creation and annihilation operators of atoms ( molecules ) , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225 are respectively the hopping parameter of atoms , the hopping parameter of molecules , the atomic onsite interaction parameter , the molecular onsite interaction parameter , and the inter - species interaction parameter . \n the conversion term is tunable via the parameter @xmath226 and does not conserve the number @xmath227 of atoms or the number @xmath228 of molecules \n . however the total number of particles @xmath229 is conserved and is the canonical constraint . \n the parameter @xmath230 allows to control the ratio between the number of atoms and molecules . \n the application of the sgf algorithm to the hamiltonian ( [ twospecies ] ) is described in details in ref.@xcite . \n the changes coming with the directed update scheme are completely independent of the chosen hamiltonian . \n the following table shows the mean number of creations and destructions in one step , @xmath231 , and the relative efficiency @xmath232 of the algorithm applied to @xmath212 at half filling , for which we have measured the energy @xmath233 , the superfluid density @xmath234 , and the number of particles in the zero momentum state @xmath235 :    . \n relative efficiency of the algorithm applied to @xmath212 at half filling for the energy , the superfluid density , and the number of particles in the zero momentum state . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     while the best value of @xmath211 depends on the hamiltonian which is considered and the measured quantity , it appears that a good compromise is to choose @xmath211 between @xmath236 and @xmath237 . \n the improvment of the efficiency is remarkable . in the following , \n we illustrate the applicability of the algorithm to problems with non - uniform potentials , by adding a parabolic trap to the hamiltonian ( [ twospecies ] ) : @xmath238 the parameters @xmath239 and @xmath240 allow to control the curvature of the trap associated to atoms and molecules , respectively , and @xmath31 is the number of lattice sites . \n the inclusion of this term in the algorithm is trivial since only the values of the diagonal energies @xmath241 and @xmath242 are changed . \n figures ( [ density ] ) and ( [ momentum ] ) show the density profiles and momentum distribution functions obtained for a system with @xmath243 lattice sites initially loaded with @xmath244 atoms and no molecules , and the parameters @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and @xmath254 . \n the presented results have been obtained by performing @xmath255 updates for thermalization , and @xmath256 updates with measurements ( an update is to be understood as the occurence of a diagonal configuration ) . \n the time of the simulation is about 8 hours on a cheap 32 bits laptop with 1ghz processor , with an implementation of the algorithm involving dynamical structures with pointers ( see ref.@xcite ) .    ) to the hamiltonian ( [ twospecies ] ) . \n the errorbars are smaller than the symbol sizes , and are the biggest in the neighborhood of site indices 23 and 47 where they equal the size of the symbols . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    ) to the hamiltonian ( [ twospecies ] ) . \n the errorbars are smaller than the symbol sizes , and are the biggest for @xmath257 where they equal the size of the symbols . \n , scaledwidth=45.0% ] \n we have presented a directed update scheme for the sgf algorithm , which has the properties of keeping the simplicity and generality of the original algorithm , and improves significantly its efficiency . \n i would like to express special thanks to peter denteneer for useful suggestions . \n this work is part of the research program of the `` stichting voor fundamenteel onderzoek der materie ( fom ) , '' which is financially supported by the `` nederlandse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek ( nwo ) . '' \n we describe here how to generate numbers with the appropriate exponential distribution ( [ exponentialdistribution ] ) . assuming that we have at our disposal a uniform random number generator that generates a random variable @xmath258 with the distribution @xmath259 for @xmath260 \n , we would like to find a function @xmath52 such that the random variable @xmath261 is generated with the distribution @xmath262 where @xmath46 and @xmath263 are the parameters of the exponential distribution . \n because of the relation @xmath261 , the probability to find @xmath264 in the range @xmath265 must be equal to the probability to find @xmath258 in the range @xmath266 . \n this implies the condition @xmath267 with @xmath268 . \n thus we have @xmath269 taking the anti - derivative with respect to @xmath270 on both sides of the equation , we get @xmath271 where @xmath272 is a constant . this constant and the correct sign are determined by imposing the conditions @xmath273 and @xmath274 . as a result , if @xmath270 is a realization of @xmath258 , then a realization of @xmath264 is given by @xmath275.\\ ] ]    10 nicholas metropolis and s. ulam , journal of the american statistical association , number 247 , volume 44 ( 1949 ) . \n handscomb , proc . \n 58 , 594 ( 1962 ) . \n kalos , phys . \n 128 , 1791 ( 1962 ) . \n r. blankenbecler , d.j . \n scalapino and r.l . \n sugar , phys . \n d 24 , 2278 ( 1981 ) . g.g . \n batrouni and r.t . \n scalettar , phys . \n b * 46 * , 9051 ( 1992 ) . w. von der linden , phys . rep . \n 220 , 53 ( 1992 ) . \n evertz , g. lana and m. marcu , phys . \n 70 , 875 - 879 ( 1993 ) . \n ceperley , rev . \n 67 , 279 ( 1995 ) . \n beard and u .- j . \n wiese , phys . \n 77 5130 ( 1996 ) . \n `` quantum monte carlo methods in physics and chemistry '' , ed . m.p . nightingale and c.j . \n umrigar , nato science series c 525 , kluwer academic publishers , dordrecht , ( 1999 ) . \n sandvik , j. phys . \n a * 25 * , 3667 ( 1992 ) ; phys . rev . \n b * 59 * , 14157 ( 1999 ) . n.v . \n prokofev , b.v . \n svistunov , and i.s . \n tupitsyn , jetp lett . * 87 * , 310 ( 1998 ) . \n m. rigol , a. muramatsu , g.g . \n batrouni , and r.t . \n scalettar , phys . \n lett . * 91 * , 130403 ( 2003 ) . \n k. van houcke , s.m.a . \n rombouts , and l. pollet , phys . \n e * 73*,056703 ( 2006 ) . \n rousseau , phys . \n e * 77 * , 056705 ( 2008 ) . \n sandvik , s. daul , r.r.p . \n singh , and d.j . \n lett . * 89 * , 247201 ( 2002 ) . \n rousseau , r.t . \n scalettar , and g.g . \n batrouni , phys . \n b * 72 * , 054524 ( 2005 ) . \n n. metropolis , a.w . \n rosenbluth , m.n . \n metropolis , a.h . \n teller , and e. teller , j. chem . phys . \n * 21 * , 1087 ( 1953 ) . \n olav f. syljuasen , anders w. sandvik , phys . \n e * 66 * , 046701 ( 2002 ) . \n rousseau and p.j.h . \n denteneer , phys . \n a * 77 * , 013609 ( 2008 ) .",
        "abstract": "The article introduces an enhanced update scheme for the Stochastic Green Function (SGF) algorithm, which improves its efficiency while maintaining its generality and simplicity. The SGF algorithm applies to any lattice Hamiltonian of a specific form, allowing efficient simulations of complex quantum systems. The modification optimizes sampling over imaginary time, enabling the study of diverse Hamiltonians without requiring algorithmic changes."

        "article": "densely - grafted chains on nonadsorbing substrate surfaces form the so - called `` polymer brush''@xcite . \n these systems find various important applications @xcite , e.g. as lubricants @xcite , for colloid stabilization @xcite , for tuning of adhesion and wetting properties @xcite , for improving the biocompatibility of drugs @xcite , as protective coatings preventing protein adsorption ( `` nonfouling '' surfaces ) in a biological milieu @xcite , microfluidic chips for biomolecule separation @xcite , etc . \n the theoretical description of the conformations of macromolecules in these polymer brushes and their dynamics has been an active topic of research hitherto ( e.g. , @xcite ; for early reviews see @xcite \n . also the interaction of the brushes with either the solvent molecules ( e.g. @xcite ) or globular proteins @xcite and/or other nanoparticles ( e.g. , @xcite ) has found much recent attention . \n however , in many situations of interest there will also occur free polymer chains in the solution , interacting with the polymers of the brush . \n this interaction has received relatively less attention , apart from the case where a polymer brush interacts with a dense polymer melt @xcite . \n the latter case is particularly interesting because there is very little interpenetration of the grafted chains in the melt and the free chains in the brush even if their chemical nature is identical ( `` wetting autophobicity '' @xcite ) . \n in contrast , scaling theory @xcite , self - consistent field @xcite and simulation @xcite have predicted partial penetration of free chains into moderately dense brushes of identical chemical nature in semi - dilute solutions when the monomer volume fraction in solution approaches that of the brush , and this behavior has been confirmed experimentally @xcite . of course , when the polymer solution is very dilute , the brush provides a free energy barrier for penetration of free chains into it and this limits the grafting density that can be achieved when one prepares a brush by grafting chains from solution @xcite ( see also some attempts to model this process by simulations @xcite ) . \n similarly , since typically the energy won by the chain end when it gets grafted is of the order of @xmath22 only @xcite , there is a nonzero probability that brush chains get released from the grafting substrate surface and are subsequently expelled from the brush @xcite . \n however , most cases studied so far refer to the situation that ( apart from chain end effects ) the chains in the bulk and those in the solution are identical . \n it is interesting , therefore , to consider the more general situation when the grafted chains and those in the bulk differ in their chemical nature . \n then the problem of compatibility ( traditionally modelled by introducing a flory - huggins @xmath1-parameter @xcite ) between the two types of chains arises . \n then , there is also no reason to assume that the length @xmath23 of the grafted chains , and the length @xmath0 of the free chains are equal \n . such situations ( in particular , when the grafted and the free chains attract each other , @xmath24 ) are of great interest for modern applications such as protein adsorption ,  antifouling  surfaces @xcite , etc . \n however , to the best of our knowledge , no systematic study of the effects of the various parameters ( @xmath25 and monomer concentration of the free chains @xmath26 ) on the amount of absorption and the penetration kinetics has been reported so far . \n the present paper presents simulation and density functional theory ( dft ) results in an effort to fill this gap . in section [ model ] \n we describe the model and comment on some simulation aspects ; section [ theory ] summarizes our theoretical approach which includes both static and dynamic versions ( ddft ) of dft as well as self - consistent field theory ( scft ) calculations . \n the numerical results are described in section [ results_sec ] while section [ summary ] contains a summary and discussion .     at grafting density @xmath27 and free chains of length @xmath28 at equilibrium : ( left ) absorption at @xmath29 , and ( right ) expulsion at @xmath30 . \n [ snapshots_fig],title=\"fig : \" ]   at grafting density @xmath27 and free chains of length @xmath28 at equilibrium : ( left ) absorption at @xmath29 , and ( right ) expulsion at @xmath30 . \n [ snapshots_fig],title=\"fig : \" ] \n we have used a coarse grained off - lattice bead spring model@xcite to describe the polymer chains in our system . as far as for many applications in a biological context \n rather short grafted chains are used @xcite , we restrict ourselves to length @xmath31 of the grafted chains . \n the polymer brush consists of linear chains of length @xmath23 grafted at one end to a flat structureless surface . \n the effective bonded interaction is described by the fene ( finitely extensible nonlinear elastic ) potential , @xmath32\\ ] ] with @xmath33 . \n thus the equilibrium bond length between nearest neighbor monomers is @xmath34 . here and in what follows we use the maximal extension of the bonds,@xmath35 , as our unit length while the potential strength is measured in units of thermal energy @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the boltzmann constant . \n the nonbonded interactions between brush and free chain segments are described by the morse potential , @xmath38 - 2\\exp[-\\alpha(r - r_{min})]\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath39 standing for the strength of brush - brush , @xmath40 , polymer - polymer , @xmath41 , and brush - polymer , @xmath42 interactions . in our present study \n we take typically @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( that is , in the good solvent regime with only excluded volume interactions ) . for @xmath45 the free chains \n are absorbed in the brush whereas for @xmath46 the polymer brush ejects them into the bulk . \n note that we define here the compatibility parameter @xmath1 simply as @xmath47 , and do not include the coordination number ( which is done when one uses lattice models @xcite . \n the size of the container is @xmath48 . \n the polymer chains are tethered to grafting sites which constitute a triangular periodic lattice on the substrate whereby the closest distance between grafting sites is @xmath35 . \n thus the largest grafting density @xmath49 involves @xmath50 brush segments , if the polymer chains are anchored at distance @xmath35 , and @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 brush segments , if the lattice constant , i.e. , the distance between adjacent head monomers on the surface is equal to @xmath53 . note that @xmath54 corresponds to a simulation where the monomer density in the brush near the wall is close to the density of a polymer melt while @xmath55 would correspond to a rather concentrated polymer solution .    for the chain model , @xmath56 corresponds to good solvent conditions since the theta - point for a ( dilute ) solution of polymers described by the model , eqs . \n [ fene]-[morse ] has been estimated@xcite as @xmath57 . in all our simulations we use brushes formed by polymer chains consisting of @xmath31 effective monomers whereas the number of free chains @xmath58 of length @xmath0 ( where @xmath0 spans the interval @xmath59 ) is taken such that the total number of free chain segments remains constant and is equal to @xmath60 . for a certain length @xmath61 , \n however , we also change the concentration of free chains in the container by varying their number @xmath58 in the interval @xmath62 . \n thus , the volume fraction @xmath63 of @xmath64-free chains is varied between @xmath65 . \n note that , as usual , solvent molecules are not explicitly included  @xcite but work which includes solvent explicitly  @xcite would yield very similar results .    for a dense brush with polymer chains of lengths \n @xmath31 statistical averages were derived from typically @xmath66 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) per monomer . \n the monte carlo algorithm consists of attempted moves whereby a monomer is chosen at random and one attempts to displace it to a new randomly chosen position @xmath67 regarding the old position . \n we use periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath68 directions and impenetrable hard walls in the @xmath69 direction . \n two typical configurations of the polymer brush with free chains of length @xmath28 , are shown in fig . \n [ snapshots_fig ] for the case of good , @xmath29 , and poor , @xmath30 , compatibility with the polymer brush . \n we employ classical dft to compute density profiles of free and grafted polymer chains . \n theory has been discussed in detail in previous publications , so here we briefly summarize its most important aspects . the starting point of the dft treatment is the expression for the grand free energy , @xmath70 , as a functional of the density profiles of free and grafted chains , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively ( @xmath73 , where @xmath74 are the positions of the chain segments ) . \n the functional @xmath70 is related to the helmholtz free energy functional , @xmath75 , via a legendre transform:@xcite @xmath76= f[\\phi_o({\\textbf}{r}_o),\\phi_p({\\textbf}{r}_p ) ] + \\sum_{\\alpha = o , p}\\int d{\\textbf}{r}_{\\alpha } \\phi_{\\alpha}({\\textbf}{r}_{\\alpha})v_{\\alpha}({\\textbf}{r}_{\\alpha } ) , \\label{omega}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the external field , which in the present case is due to the hard - sphere like interaction of the polymer segments with the hard wall , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 otherwise , with analogous expression holding for @xmath82 . \n additionally , the innermost ( @xmath83 ) bead of each grafted chain is tethered to the wall via a grafting potential @xmath84=\\delta(z_1)$ ] , where @xmath85 . \n note that the chemical potential of both free and grafted chains is absent from the second term of eq . \n ( [ omega ] ) because the dft calculations are performed at a fixed number of both free and grafted segments in order to mimic the mc simulations : @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in the above \n , @xmath88 is the box length and @xmath89 is the wall area . \n the helmholtz free energy functional is separated into ideal and excess parts,@xcite with the former given by : @xmath90= \\sum_{\\alpha = o , p}\\left\\ { \\int d{\\textbf}{r}_{\\alpha } \\phi_{\\alpha}({\\textbf}{r}_{\\alpha } ) [ \\ln \\phi_{\\alpha}({\\textbf}{r}_{\\alpha})-1 ] + \\beta \\int d{\\textbf}{r}_{\\alpha } \\phi_{\\alpha}({\\textbf}{r}_{\\alpha } )   v_b({\\textbf}{r}_{\\alpha})\\right\\}.   \\label{fideal}\\ ] ] where the bonding energy @xmath91 for the grafted chains is taken as follows : @xmath92= \\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}\\frac{\\delta(|{\\textbf}{r}_i-{\\textbf}{r}_{i+1}|-b_l)}{4\\pi b_{l}^{2 } } ,   \\label{vbond}\\ ] ] with a similar expression for free chains , with @xmath23 replaced by @xmath0 . \n this bonding potential constrains adjacent segments to a fixed separation @xmath93 . \n the excess part of the helmholtz free energy is written as a sum of repulsive ( hard chain ) and attractive terms , with the former computed in the weighted density approximation and the latter obtained within mean - field approach , using eqs . \n ( 12)-(17 ) from ref .  @xcite ; for the sake of brevity we do not reproduce these equations here . \n the minimization of the grand free energy functional with respect to @xmath72 yields the equilibrium density distribution for the grafted chains which can be integrated over grafting and bonding delta - functions to obtain the following result for the density profile of the @xmath94th segment of the grafted chains:@xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 , \\label{ipz}\\ ] ] with @xmath97 the two propagators in eq . \n ( [ phipi ] ) , @xmath98 and @xmath99 move from the free ( @xmath100 ) and the tethered ( @xmath83 ) ends of the chain , respectively . \n they are computed via recursive relations given by eqs . \n ( 23)-(25 ) of ref . \n @xcite . \n the normalization constant @xmath101 in eq . \n ( [ phipi ] ) is chosen to ensure that the @xmath94th segment density profile is normalized to @xmath102 . \n the total segment density profile for the grafted chains is given by : @xmath103 the equilibrium density profile for the segments of the free chains can be obtained in a similar way , by minimizing the grand free energy functional with respect to @xmath71 and integrating over bond - length constraining delta functions . \n the dft equations described above are solved simultaneously to obtain the segment density profiles for free and grafted chains . \n the equations are solved iteratively using picard algorithm,@xcite with the step size along the @xmath69 coordinate taken to be 0.0325 . the above procedure yields equilibrium segment density profiles for a given set of interaction potentials . in addition to the equilibrium structural properties , we have also studied the kinetics of the adsorption of free chains into the brush , following a switch of the interaction potential between free and grafted segments from repulsive to attractive . \n to this end , we have employed the ddft method , which is a dynamical generalization of the dft approach.@xcite mc simulations have indicated that the segment density profiles of the grafted chains are essentially independent of the strength of the attraction between free and grafted segments . accordingly , in our ddft calculations we take @xmath104 to be time independent and focus on the time dependence of the free chain density , @xmath105 . \n the time evolution of the segment density profile of free chains is given by the following equation:@xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the non - equilibrium local chemical potential , and dimensionless time @xmath19 is defined according to @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the mobility coefficient . \n initial density profile @xmath110 corresponds to the equilibrium distribution of free chains at a repulsive brush , i.e. @xmath30 . at @xmath111 , the brush - free polymer attraction is instantaneously `` switched on '' , i.e. we set @xmath112 . \n the time - dependent polymer density profile is then propagated according to the eq . \n ( [ phipzt ] ) , with the time - dependent chemical potential given by : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is obtained by substituting the time - dependent density @xmath105 into the expression for @xmath115 ( and likewise for the propagators @xmath116 and @xmath117 . \n we solve eq . \n ( [ phipzt ] ) using crank - nicholson scheme.@xcite note that eq . \n ( [ phipzt ] ) has the form of a continuity equation with the flux ( current density ) given by @xmath118 . \n the fact that the ddft method propagates @xmath105 via a continuity - type equation guarantees the conservation of the total number of segments in the system , which is consistent with the simulation set - up .    in order to compare the results of the ddft approach with kinetic mc data \n , we set the mobility coefficient @xmath109 equal to unity and adjust the conversion factor between ddft dimensionless time and kinetic mc number of steps for one particular set of parameters @xmath0 and @xmath26 . \n comparisons for all other values of @xmath0 and @xmath26 are performed using the same conversion factor , while assuming @xmath109 to be inversely proportional to both @xmath0 and @xmath26 .    with the goal of shedding further light on the thermodynamic aspects of the adsorption process , we have also performed self - consistent field theory ( scft ) calculations of the structural properties as a function of the interaction strength between the segments of the brush and the free chains ( in scft approach this interaction \n is characterized by the parameter @xmath1 which is calculated in the standard fashion from the corresponding potential well - depths : @xmath119 ) . \n the main motivation behind carrying out scft calculations is the fact that this approach provides a more straightforward way to decompose the free energy into entropic and energetic components , thereby providing a complementary ( to dft ) view of the adsorption process . \n the basic equations of the scft method are well known,@xcite and will not be reproduced here for the sake of brevity . \n once again , the density profiles for free and grafted chains are written in terms of the propagators , the only major difference from the dft approach being that instead of the equation of state , one employs the incompressibility constraint to set up the equations for the density profiles , which are once again solved iteratively using picard s method . \n for example , the equation for the density profile of the grafted chain segments takes the form : @xmath120 where the normalization constant @xmath121 is obtained from the grafting density @xmath102 , and @xmath122 , with @xmath123 . \n the hard core potential @xmath124 is independent of the segment type and serves as a lagrange multiplier enforcing the incompressibility condition , meaning that the lattice space is completely filled and no segment overlap occurs . \n the density profile of the free chain segments is obtained in a similar way . \n once the profiles are calculated , one can easily obtain excess entropy and energy of the free chains ( relative to pure unmixed components ) as follows @xcite : @xmath125 @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the bulk volume fraction of free chains . \n in fig .

fig . \n [ phi_l_fig]c , d . in all graphs \n one observes pronounced depletion effects at the upper container wall , opposing the brush . \n however , the inhomogeneity of @xmath128 near the wall at @xmath139 has no effect on @xmath128 in the region of the polymer brush , the flat part of @xmath128 in between the brush and the confining wall at @xmath139 is broad enough to eliminate any finite - size effects associated with the finite linear dimension of the simulation box in @xmath140direction . \n one should note also the good agreement between simulation and dft results . \n in fact , the thin lines , indicating the latter , may hardly be distinguished from the monte carlo data ( thick lines ) in fig . \n [ phi_l_fig]a , b . \n the only significant discrepancy between theory and simulation is observed in the brush profile in the vicinity of the grafting wall , where dft approach overestimates the oscillations . \n this discrepancy is likely due to the fact that in the dft method the bond lengths are constraint via delta - functions to a constant value of @xmath141 , while in the simulations the bonds are allowed to vibrate under fene potential , eq . \n ( [ fene ] ) . for @xmath61 , fig . \n [ dens_nobst_fig ] shows a qualitatively similar behavior of the density profiles for the cases of gradually increasing free chain concentration ( indicated by the number of free chains @xmath142 as parameter ) . \n expectedly , for @xmath143 ( which corresponds to monomer concentration @xmath144 ) and @xmath27 , the free chains are present in the bulk over the brush as the brush interior is then entirely filled . \n however , when the brush - free chain attraction increases to @xmath145 , the mc data ( not shown here ) indicate complete absorption of the free chains into the brush with virtually no free chains in the bulk above the polymer brush even at the highest concentration of @xmath146 .    with increasing grafting density and/or free chain concentration , \n the agreement between dft and mc deteriorates somewhat , with the theory underestimating the degree of penetration of free chains into the brush ( see discussion of fig . \n [ ads_amount_fig ] below ) , which is likely due to the simple tarazona s weighting function employed in our dft calculations . \n it is well known that at higher densities it would be more appropriate to use weighting functions from the fundamental measure theory.@xcite indeed , precisely such approach has been recently used to study adsorption and retention of spherical particles in polymer brushes @xcite .     with polymerization index @xmath0 of the free chains for two grafting densities . \n empty symbols denote dft results . \n the case @xmath147 refers to the _ critical _ degree of brush -

polymer attraction proceeds much faster than the absorption kinetics . \n the latter , as is visible from the inset to fig . \n [ kin_fig]a , proceeds through an initial steep increase toward a saturation plateau of @xmath154 whereby the small species absorb faster than those with larger @xmath0 . from the intersection of the tangent to the initial steep growth of @xmath154 and the saturation value \n one may determine the characteristic time of absorption @xmath19 as function of @xmath0 - fig . \n [ kin_fig]b . \n the results are presented for all values of free chain lengths , and one sees that ddft results are again in good agreement with kinetic mc data . \n this also holds in fig . \n [ kin_fig]b where indeed the theory is in good agreement with simulations for @xmath31 . for the case of longer grafted chains ( @xmath23=64 , @xmath181=0.2 ) , \n no simulations were performed and only     against elapsed time @xmath178 after the onset of absorption for different concentration of free chains with @xmath61 . \n the log -

intuitive , as one would expect the driving force for absorption ( and , hence , the absorption rate ) to increase with increasing concentration of free chains . \n a slowing down of absorption kinetics with growing size @xmath0 and concentration @xmath133 of the free chains has been experimentally observed @xcite in a porous medium ( activated carbon ) which resembles in certain aspects the polymer brush . in fig . \n [ dens_fig]b we show the variation of the absorbed amount , @xmath186 , for the critical attraction @xmath193 - see [ crit_sect ] . \n we point out that this well pronounced power law increase of @xmath154 was observed only at this particular value of @xmath42 whereas for @xmath194 where most of our kinetic measurement were performed , no simple @xmath195 relationship was found - cf . \n [ kin_fig]a . \n thus , in a sense , the particular kinetics of absorption underlines the special role of the critical compatibility between brush and free chains .     of free chains with time elapsed after a quench from @xmath196 to @xmath197 from dft data . \n the time is given in logarithmic coordinates . here the mean concentration @xmath198 and the time unit corresponds to 25000 mcs . \n the polymer brush is located at @xmath199 . \n ( b ) variation of the flux of free chains into the polymer brush with time for two concentrations @xmath200 i.e. , @xmath201 , and @xmath61 . \n [ kin_3d_fig],title=\"fig : \" ]   of free chains with time elapsed after a quench from @xmath196 to @xmath197 from dft data . \n the time is given in logarithmic coordinates . here the mean concentration @xmath198 and the time unit corresponds to 25000 mcs . \n the polymer brush is located at @xmath199 . \n ( b ) variation of the flux of free chains into the polymer brush with time for two concentrations @xmath200 i.e. , @xmath201 , and @xmath61 . \n [ kin_3d_fig],title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to shed further light on the observed behavior , fig . \n [ kin_3d_fig ] shows ddft results for the time - dependent density profile @xmath105 ( @xmath58=24 , left panel ) and flux @xmath202 ( @xmath58=8 and 32 , right panel ) . in the left panel \n , one observes two `` ridges '' in @xmath105 at all times  a principal ridge , initially located in the bulk above the brush , moves gradually inside , while another ( smaller ) ridge is located near the opposite ( bare ) wall and gradually disappears still moving in the bulk . from the right panel \n , one can see that for higher concentration ( @xmath58=32 ) the flux prevails over the lower concentration one inside the brush and at shorter times ( thereby explaining higher initial values of @xmath154 seen in fig . \n [ dens_fig ] for larger values of @xmath58 ) , while the situation is reversed outside the brush at longer times . \n the latter behavior is presumably due to higher mobility at lower concentrations and explains the decrease of slope @xmath183 with @xmath58 seen in the inset of fig . \n [ dens_fig ] . \n in this work we studied a scarcely explored yet important aspect of oligomer and linear macromolecule absorption in a polymer brush - the case of ( more or less ) good compatibility between species in the bulk and grafted chains . \n starting from oligomers ( mono- and dimers ) and going up to chain lengths @xmath0 which exceed twice the length @xmath23 of the grafted chains , we have determined the conformation of the absorbed species , the absorbed amount @xmath154 , and absorption kinetics ( the propagation rate into the polymer brush ) at different concentration of the free chains for two cases of moderately to very dense polymer brushes . \n in addition , by combining monte carlo simulations with dft and scft calculations , we have substantially broadened the range of lengths of the grafted chains to @xmath13 in order to test more comprehensively our findings . \n the most salient , and - to some extent - unexpected features of linear chain absorption in a polymer brush that we find are :    * the dramatic increase in adsorbed amount @xmath7 with _ growing _ chain length @xmath0 , and * the significant slowdown of absorption kinetics with growing concentration ( i.e. , with the increase of the starting gradient in density ) of the free chains    besides these static and dynamic properties of polymer absorption in brushes , we find that both the absorbed macromolecules and the brush itself largely retain their structure and conformation , as seen in quantities like @xmath203 and the monomer density profile @xmath104 , for different length @xmath0 and concentration @xmath26 of the free chains , and different strength @xmath42 of attraction to the grafted chains . \n in particular , the degree to which the brush profile @xmath104 is affected by absorption is found to be much less that anticipated in some earlier theoretical predictions @xcite . \n nontheless , even within these small changes we observe a slight contraction of @xmath104 at small absorbed amounts @xmath154 while @xmath104 gradually attains its extension roughly to that corresponding to zero concentration of free chains with growing @xmath154 . \n an interesting finding which still needs deeper understanding is the observed existence of a critical compatibility @xmath204 ( i.e. , brush - oligomer attraction @xmath205 ) . at @xmath206 we find both in mc as well as in dft / scft that the energy of all absorbed species has a value independent of their size @xmath0 whereas their entropy experiences a minimum . \n the critical attraction @xmath205 is manifested by the existence of unique distance from the grafting plane where all monomer density profiles of the free chains intersect . moreover , at @xmath205 the kinetics of free chain absorption into the brush follows a clear cut power law with exponent @xmath207 . \n undoubtedly , much more work is needed until all these fascinating new features are fully understood . \n last not least , we emphasize the finding of three distinct regimes in the kinetics of free chain absorption as far as the size of the free chains @xmath0 is concerned . in the first regime \n the characteristic time for absorption @xmath19 grows rapidly with oligomer length @xmath0 as long as the oligomer size @xmath208 remains smaller than the separation between grafting sites . \n the second regime is marked by a slower increase of @xmath19 with @xmath0 and ends roughly at @xmath209 . \n the third regime of absorption kinetics holds for @xmath180 ( i.e. , the penetrating free chain can not accommodate within the brush ) and is characterized by a nearly constant @xmath19 as far as length @xmath0 is concerned . \n interestingly , this rich kinetic behavior has been experimentally observed in absorption in porous media @xcite . \n one of us , ( a. m. ) , acknowledges support under grant no . bi314/22 . \n another , ( s. a. e. ) , acknowledges support from the alexander von humboldt foundation , germany . \n s. alexander , j. physique ( paris ) * 38 * , 983 ( 1977 ) . \n g . de gennes , macromolecules , * 13 * , 1069 ( 1980 ) . \n a. m. skvortsov , a. a. gorbunov , i. v. pavlushkov , e. b. zhulina , o. v. borisov , and v. a. pryamitzyn , polym . \n 30 * , 1706 ( 1988 ) . \n t. cosgrove , t. heath , b. van lahr , f. leermakers , and j. m. h. scheutjens , macromolecules * 20 * , 1692 ( 1988 ) . \n s. t. milner , t. a. witten , and m. e. cates , macromolecules * 21 * , 2610 ( 1988 ) . \n m. muthukumar and j. s. ho , macromolecules * 22 * , 965 ( 1989 ) . m. murat and g. s. grest , macromolecules * 22 * , 4054 ( 1989 ) . \n p. y. lai and k. binder , j. chem . \n phys . * 95 * , 9288 ( 1991 ) . \n s. t. milner , science * 251 * , 905 ( 1991 ) . \n a. halperin , m. tirrell , and t. p. lodge , adv . \n sci . * 100 * , 33 ( 1992 ) . \n i. szleifer and m. a. carignano , adv . \n chem . phys . * 94 * , 165 ( 1996 ) . \n j. klein , ann . \n * 26 * , 581 ( 1996 ) . \n g. s. grest and m. murat , in _ \n monte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations in polymer science _ \n k. binder , oxford univ . \n press , new york , 1995 , pp . \n 476 -

        "abstract": "This study explores the absorption of linear polymer chains into polymer brushes under varying compatibility, chain lengths, and concentrations. Using Monte Carlo simulations and density functional theory, researchers identified a critical compatibility value where density profiles intersect. Absorption varies with grafting density, chain length, and compatibility, with longer chains penetrating deeper. Kinetics revealed three regimes based on chain length, showing slower absorption with increased concentration. The findings highlight critical interactions in polymer systems, advancing applications in biocompatible coatings and material design."

        "article": "systems of interacting open- and closed - strings play important roles in several aspects of string theory . \n it has been found out that theories even formulated as pure closed - strings have open - string sectors when they are accompanied by d - branes @xcite . \n one of the most important features of such open - closed mixed systems is a duality between open- and closed - strings . \n this duality becomes manifest , for instance , by seeing one - loop diagrams of open - string as tree propagations of closed - string through modular transformations on the string world - sheets . in the systems of d - branes , \n this duality should be a rationale for correspondence between gauge theory on the world - volumes ( open - string sector ) and gravity theory in the bulk space - time ( closed - string sector ) . \n ads / cft correspondence @xcite@xcite@xcite may be regarded as one of the most remarkable examples of such bulk - boundary correspondence . \n this viewpoint was emphasized also in @xcite . \n nevertheless it becomes very difficult to establish the correspondence between the two . \n this is essentially because light particles ( ir effects ) in the one sector are realized by summing up whole massive towers ( uv effects ) in the other sector . \n when a constant @xmath0 field background of closed - string is turned on , however , we expect that the situation could be drastically changed . on this background , \n the world - volumes of d - branes become non - commutative  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . \n low - energy effective theories of the open - string sector , therefore , become field theories on the non - commutative world - volumes . \n it was pointed out @xcite that in such theories there happens a mixing of the uv and the ir . \n this uv / ir mixing gives @xcite us a chance to capture some effects of light particles in the bulk gravity theories , e.g.  gravitons , by investigating non - commutative field theories on the world - volumes . \n to pursue such possibility , non - planar one - loop amplitudes of open - string were studied on this background @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . \n higher loops were investigated as well in @xcite . \n coupling of non - commutative d - branes to closed - string in the bulk has attracted much interest particularly from the viewpoint of bulk - boundary correspondence @xcite@xcite . \n it was pointed out in @xcite@xcite that the generalized star - products arise in disk amplitudes consisting of a closed - string vertex operator and open - string vertex ones on a constant @xmath0 field background . \n the generalized star products are also found to appear in straight open wilson lines by the expansions in powers of non - commutative gauge fields @xcite . \n these observations were combined in @xcite and it was shown there that in the zero - slope limit of @xcite disk amplitudes of a closed - string tachyon and arbitrary numbers of gauge fields on this background give rise to a straight open wilson line . thus it has been clarified that open wilson lines play a role in the correspondence between the bulk gravity and the non - commutative gauge theories . \n open wilson lines found in @xcite are remarkable gauge invariant objects in non - commutative gauge theories . \n gauge invariant operators in non - commutative gauge theories can be constructed in the forms of local operators smeared along straight wilson lines  @xcite@xcite@xcite . \n it was also shown in @xcite that coupling of closed - string graviton to non - commutative gauge theories actually is an operator of this form . \n open wilson lines need not be straight in order to be gauge invariant . taking account of the above role played by straight open wilson lines in the bulk - boundary duality , dhar and kitazawa @xcite conjectured that curved open wilson lines fluctuating around a straight path \n should be brought about by higher level ( stringy ) states of closed - string . \n they showed that the coupling of graviton state is in fact the gauge invariant operator which appears in the leading coefficients in harmonic expansions of curved open wilson lines around a straight path . \n it is well - known that the so - called boundary states @xcite@xcite@xcite provide a description of d - branes in closed - string theory . open- and closed - strings interact on the branes in space - time . \n therefore it is further expected that boundary states admit to describe these interactions . in this article , receiving the above development and understanding , we study the system of a d - brane in bosonic string theory on a constant @xmath0 field background . in order to obtain further insight into the bulk - boundary duality , we first exploit the boundary state formalism to include states which describe arbitrary numbers of open - string tachyons and gluons . \n open - string legs of these boundary states , that is , tachyons and gluons , need not to be on - shell . \n thereby it becomes possible to study the duality .    on a constant @xmath0 field background , \n boundary state without open - string legs has been constructed in @xcite@xcite@xcite . \n it is briefly reviewed in the next section . \n let us denote the state by @xmath1 . \n this state does not lead any couplings of a closed - string to open - string excitations on the world - volume . \n we may regard @xmath1 as a perturbative vacuum of closed - string in the presence of the brane . \n it is also possible to interpret the state as a bogolubov transform of the @xmath2-invariant vacuum of closed - string : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a suitable generator of the transformation .    in section [ sec : tachyon boundary state ] we construct boundary states of open - string tachyons . \n basic idea of the construction may be explained as follows . \n we first examine an insertion of a closed - string tachyon into the brane . \n let us suppose that the closed - string world - sheet is an infinite semi - cylinder @xmath5 with @xmath6 and that the brane or the state @xmath1 is located at @xmath7 . \n we may describe the insertion by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a closed - string tachyon vertex operator . \n however , there occurs a singularity within @xmath9 at the world - sheet boundary . \n this originates in correlations between the chiral and the anti - chiral sectors which are caused by the brane . \n we then regularize such a singularity and define a renormalized tachyon vertex operator @xmath10 . \n it turns out surprisingly that the renormalized operator becomes an open - string tachyon vertex at the boundary . in our prescription of the renormalization , disk green s function and the transform \n @xmath11 play essential roles . \n boundary state of a single open - string tachyon is given by @xmath12 . \n boundary states of arbitrary numbers of open - string tachyons turn out to be realized by the successive insertions of the above renormalized operators . as for boundary states of gluons \n , they can be obtained by taking the same steps as illustrated above , except that we need to introduce a suitable local operator of closed - string in place of @xmath9 and renormalize it in a suitable fashion . \n these are presented in section [ sec : gluon boundary state ] . \n consistency of the constructions is examined from several aspects at some length . in particular , we compute closed - string tree propagations between these boundary states and make sure that they reproduce the corresponding open - string one - loop amplitudes . \n these are presented separately in section [ sec : tachyon boundary state ] for the tachyons and in section [ sec : gluon boundary state ] for the gluons . \n it is also worth noting that the present constructions are relevant on a vanishing @xmath0 field background . \n low - energy description of world - volume theories of d - branes is obtained by taking a zero - slope limit @xmath13 so that it makes all perturbative stringy states ( @xmath14 ) of open - string infinitely heavy and decouple from the light states . as regards one - loop amplitudes of open - string , this can be achieved by taking the limit with @xmath15 fixed . here \n @xmath16 is the proper time on the world - sheet of open - string . \n the fixed parameter @xmath17 becomes the schwinger parameter of one - loop amplitudes of low - energy effective world - volume theories . \n it is shown @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite that one - loop amplitudes of open - string tachyons on a constant @xmath0 field background reduce to those of a non - commutative ( tachyonic ) scalar field theory on the world - volume . \n the above zero - slope limit can be interpreted as magnification of the string amplitudes in the vicinity of @xmath18 . in section [ sec : uv nc scalar ] we investigate a possible uv behavior of this non - commutative field theory . in order to know the uv behavior one needs to focus on the region @xmath19 . for the description \n we take the following route . \n we introduce a parameter @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the closed - string proper time . \n @xmath22 and @xmath23 are related to each other through the modular transformation of the world - sheet by @xmath24 . \n then we take a zero - slope limit with @xmath23 fixed . \n existence of @xmath0 field allows us to make the limit slightly different from the standard field theory limit of closed - string ( gravity limit ) . \n this enables us to capture the world - volume theories . \n this zero - slope limit is magnification of the string amplitudes in the vicinity of @xmath25 and hence the region @xmath19 . strictly speaking , \n this is a trans - string scale of the world - volume theories . generating function of one - loop amplitudes of open - string tachyons is found out to be factorized at the limit into two ( analogues of ) straight open wilson lines exchanging closed - string tachyons . in general , \n one - loop amplitudes of open - string are factorized by a tower of closed - string states . in gravity limit \n the propagations of closed - string tachyons become dominant . \n although the present limit is slightly different from gravity limit , these zero - slope limits share the common property . \n uv behavior of the non - commutative gauge theory is explored in section [ sec : uv nc gauge ] by following the same route . \n generating function of one - loop amplitudes of gluons is also found out to be factorized at this limit into two straight open wilson lines exchanging closed - string tachyons . \n these analyses indicate a possibility that field theories on the non - commutative world - volume become topological at such a trans - string scale of the world - volume . \n the conjecture @xcite leads us to expect that curved open wilson lines somehow factorize generating functions of one - loop amplitudes of gluons or open - string tachyons . \n the standard factorization made by particle states of closed - string seems to be little use . \n instead , momentum eigenstates of closed - string are used for the factorization . \n closed - string momentum @xmath26 is a momentum loop ( a loop in the momentum space ) while closed - string coordinate @xmath27 is a space - time loop . \n section [ sec : comments on eigenstates ] is devoted to introduction of coordinate and momentum eigenstates of closed - string . \n we also provide some observations on their relations with boundary states . \n factorizations made by the momentum eigenstates are examined in section  [ sec : open wilson lines ( i ) ] for the tachyons and in section [ sec : open wilson lines ( ii ) ] for the gluons . \n it turns out that in the zero - slope limit ( the previous uv limit of the world - volume theories ) momentum loops become curves in the non - commutative world - volume and that open wilson lines along these curves appear in the factorizations . \n the generating functions are factorized by two curved open wilson lines . \n more precisely , they become integrals on the space of curves with a gaussian distribution around straight lines . as \n regards fluctuations from the straight lines , width of the distribution becomes so sharp that the integrals reduce to the previous factorizations by straight open wilson lines . \n we start section [ sec : open wilson lines ( ii ) ] by giving a proof of the conjecture made by dhar and kitazawa . \n we introduce the closed - string state @xmath28 , where @xmath26 is a momentum loop . \n this state is not an eigenstate of closed - string momentum but serves as a generating function of ( generally off - shell ) closed - string states . \n overlap between @xmath29 and boundary states with open - string legs is a generating function of couplings of all the closed - string states to the non - commutative d - brane . \n the overlap with the boundary states of gluons is shown to become a curved open wilson line in the zero - slope limit . \n we make an explicit correspondence between the closed - string states and the coefficients of harmonic expansions of the curve . \n these provide the proof . \n we also show that in the zero - slope limit the momentum eigenstate is identified with the state @xmath30 after some manipulation . \n this accounts for the previous factorizations by curved open wilson lines . \n wilson line is invariant under reparametrizations of the path . \n the corresponding transformations on the string world - sheet are reparametrizations of the boundary . \n the reparametrization invariance of boundary states is fulfilled by imposing the ishibashi condition @xcite or equivalently the brst invariance on these states . as regards the boundary states of open - string tachyon and gluon it is shown in sections [ sec : tachyon boundary state ] and [ sec : gluon boundary state ] that their reparametrization invariance is equivalent to the on - shell conditions . \n on the other hand we do not require any condition on gluons to obtain open wilson lines . \n this puzzle is solved by seeing that the ishibashi condition or the brst invariance becomes null in the present zero - slope limit . \n it is observed in section [ sec : discussions ] that all the boundary states constructed so far in this article are eigenstates of the closed - string momentum operators . \n the eigenvalues are essentially delta functions on the world - sheet boundary . \n their boundary actions are computed by following the prescription given in @xcite . \n it turns out that they are the standard boundary actions used in the path - integral formalism of the world - sheet theory . after a speculation based on these observations \n we finally make a conjecture on the duality between open- and closed- strings .    in appendix \n [ sec : open - string tensors ] world - volume and space - time tensors used in the text are summarized including their relations . in appendix \n [ sec : formulae ] some formulae of creation and annihilation modes are described . \n these are necessary for our computations of several string amplitudes in the text . \n oscillator realizations of coordinate and momentum eigenstates are presented in appendix [ sec : eigen ] . \n let us consider the system of d@xmath31-brane in bosonic string theory . \n we take the following closed - string background : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is a flat space - time metric , which we refer to as closed - string metric . \n two - form gauge field @xmath34 is constant . \n we divide the space - time directions into two pieces , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the directions @xmath38 are supposed to be parallel to the d@xmath31-brane . \n the directions @xmath39 are perpendicular to the brane . \n closed - string may capture the brane . \n relevant action of a closed - string takes the form : @xmath40=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\alpha'}\\int_{\\sigma } d\\tau d\\sigma     \\bigl \\ {    \\partial_{a}x^{m } \\partial^{a}x^{n}g_{mn }    -i2\\pi\\alpha ' \\epsilon^{ab}\\partial_{a}x^{\\mu }     \\partial_{b}x^{\\nu}b_{\\mu\\nu }    \\bigr \\}~ ,   \\label{eq : action1}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the antisymmetric tensor on the world - sheet with @xmath42 . \n the world - sheet @xmath43 is a disk or an infinite semi - cylinder , and we use the cylinder coordinates @xmath44 ( @xmath6 and @xmath45 ) . \n closed - string interacts with the brane at the boundary of the world - sheet , that is , at @xmath7 . \n the second term of the action is an integration of the two - form ( its pull - back ) on @xmath43 . \n since it is an exact two - form , by applying the stokes theorem we can recast it into a boundary integral : @xmath40 = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\alpha'}\\int_{\\sigma } d\\tau d\\sigma     \\partial_{a}x^{m } \\partial^{a}x^{n}g_{mn }    -\\frac{i}{2}\\int_{\\partial\\sigma } d\\sigma      b_{\\mu\\nu}x^{\\mu } \\partial_{\\sigma}x^{\\nu}~.      \\label{eq : action2}\\ ] ] energy - momentum tensor @xmath46 is obtained from the action . \n since the integration of the two - form is independent of the world - sheet metric , @xmath47 acquires the standard form without the @xmath0-field . \n closed - string coordinates @xmath48 have mode expansions of the form , @xmath49 and the standard first quantization requires the following commutation relations : @xmath50=ig^{mn}~ , \\quad [ \\hat{x}_{0}^{m},\\hat{x}^{n}_{0 } ] = [ \\hat{p}^{m}_{0},\\hat{p}^{n}_{0}]=0~,\\nonumber\\\\ & & [ \\alpha^{m}_{m},\\alpha^{n}_{n}]=mg^{mn}\\delta_{m+n}~ , \\quad [ \\tilde{\\alpha}^{m}_{m } , \\tilde{\\alpha}^{n}_{n } ] = mg^{mn}\\delta_{m+n}~ , \\quad [ \\alpha^{m}_{m } , \\tilde{\\alpha}^{n}_{n}]=0~. \\label{eq : ccr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy - momentum tensor generates reparametrizations of the world - sheet . \n their infinitesimal forms turn out to be the virasoro algebras with the central charges equal to @xmath51 . \n the virasoro generators are given by the expansions , @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 . \n here we use the complex coordinates @xmath56 instead of the cylinder coordinates . \n they are related by @xmath57 . @xmath58 and @xmath59 are generators of the chiral and the anti - chiral sectors respectively . \n these have the following representations in terms of the oscillator modes : @xmath60 where @xmath61 . \n @xmath62 denotes the standard normal ordering with respect to the @xmath2-invariant vacuum of closed - string @xmath63 : @xmath64 for @xmath65 and the similar prescription for the anti - chiral modes . \n the above conditions are used to introduce a boundary state in the first quantized picture of closed - string . \n let us denote it by @xmath77 . \n it is a state which satisfies the following conditions : @xmath78(\\sigma,0 )      =   x^{i}_{0 }    \\label{eq : bstate1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are linear constraints on @xmath1 and determine the state modulo its normalization . \n it turns out that the state satisfies the ishibashi condition @xcite as follows : @xmath79    the above state can be interpreted as a perturbative vacuum of closed - string in the presence of the brane . \n since there are no correlations between string - coordinates of the neumann and the dirichlet directions , we can factorize the state into a product : @xmath80 where the subscripts @xmath81 and @xmath51 denote the corresponding boundary conditions . \n we may refer to these two states respectively as the neumann and the dirichlet boundary states for short . \n they satisfy the following constraints : @xmath82 ( \\sigma,0 ) { \\bigl |}b_{n } { \\bigr\\rangle}=0~ , \\quad   x^{i}(\\sigma,0 ) { \\bigl |}b_{d } { \\bigr\\rangle}= x^{i}_{0}{\\bigl |}b_{d } { \\bigr\\rangle}~. \\label{eq : bstatend}\\ ] ] these constraints may be handled in the oscillator representations . for the neumann boundary state \n it can be read as follows : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and its transpose @xmath85 are tensors defined as @xmath86 as regards the dirichlet boundary state the constraint can be read as follows : @xmath87      let us describe these boundary states including their normalizations . \n the above constraints can be solved without any difficulty in the oscillator representations . \n determinations of their normalization factors need to be cared . \n we start with the dirichlet boundary state . \n the dirichlet boundary state turns out to be given by @xmath89 where we put @xmath90 . \n the state @xmath91 is an eigenstate of the zero modes @xmath92 with eigenvalues @xmath93 . \n momentum representation of @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes an eigenstate of the momentum zero modes @xmath97 with eigenvalues @xmath98 defined as @xmath99 the dual state can be obtained by taking the bpz conjugation : @xmath100    it is easy to see that the state ( [ state bd ] ) satisfies the conditions ( [ eq : bstate3 ] ) . \n since they are linear conditions , normalization factor of the state should be determined by other means . \n we fixed it to be @xmath101 in the above . \n it is determined by claiming that closed - string propagations along the dirichlet directions reproduce the vacuum one - loop amplitude of open - string which satisfies the dirichlet - dirichlet ( d - d ) boundary conditions . \n we parametrize propagations of closed - string by @xmath102 . \n closed - string evolves by an imaginary time @xmath103 with the hamiltonian @xmath104 . \n see figure [ cylinder ] . \n .,height=264 ]    closed - string propagations along the dirichlet directions are measured by @xmath105 , where we put @xmath106 . \n this amplitude can be easily calculated by using the formula in appendix [ sec : formulae ] . \n it turns out to be @xmath107 where @xmath108 with @xmath109 . \n contribution of the world - sheet reparametrization ghosts is excluded in eq.([bd - bd ] ) . \n it will be included in string propagations along the neumann directions . \n the corresponding amplitude of open - string is given by @xmath110 . \n open - string propagates by an imaginary time @xmath16 @xmath111 with the hamiltonian @xmath112 . \n see figure [ strip ] .    . \n two bold horizontal lines are identified.,height=264 ]    the trace is taken over the sector of open - string which satisfies the d - d boundary conditions . \n the amplitude becomes as follows : @xmath113    the standard argument allows us to interpret these open - string amplitudes as the free propagations of closed - string . \n two imaginary times are related with each other by @xmath114 . \n this leads us to write eq.([d - d ] ) as @xmath115 where the modular transformation @xmath116 is used . \n a comparison between eqs.([bd - bd ] ) and ( [ d - d2 ] ) gives the identity : @xmath117 therefore the propagations of closed - string reproduce correctly the corresponding one - loop amplitude of open - string except the factor @xmath118 . \n this factor turns out to be canceled by a similar one appearing in closed - string propagations along the neumann directions . \n the neumann boundary state is given @xcite by @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a tensor defined by @xmath122 the dual state is obtained by the bpz conjugation . \n its explicit form is as follows : @xmath123 the above normalization factor of the state is chosen to reproduce the related one - loop amplitudes of open - string . \n this will be shown in the next section . \n as can be seen in eqs.([state bd ] ) and ( [ state bn ] ) these boundary states are the bogolubov transforms of perturbative vacua . \n generators of the transformations are @xmath124 for the dirichlet boundary and @xmath125 for the neumann boundary . \n we can expect that information on the boundary conditions are all encoded in these generators . \n let @xmath126 be a local operator of closed - string . \n action of this operator on a boundary state @xmath127 , where @xmath4 is a generator , can be written as follows : @xmath128 describes the bogolubov transform of this local operator and ask the physical implication particularly from the viewpoint of boundary conformal field theories . \n however , story is not so simple . in general \n , @xmath129 turns out to be singular . \n more precisely it becomes singular at @xmath7 , where the boundary state resides . \n this reflects the fact that the system under consideration is actually a system of closed- and open - strings . \n we wish to make an idea of the bogolubov transformations of these local operators rigorous . for this purpose \n , we have to perform a regularization by which the above singularity becomes tractable . \n this leads us to define @xmath130 , which becomes regular at the world - sheet boundary . \n it is a local operator and interpreted as the adjoint transform of @xmath126 by @xmath131 \n . we will find out their physical interpretation . in this section \n we concentrate on tachyon vertex operators . since we are mainly interested in the world - volume theory of @xmath31-brane , we restrict ourselves to the bogolubov transform associated with the neumann boundary state . \n we denote the generator by @xmath132 , @xmath133      let @xmath134 be closed - string tachyon vertex operator of momentum @xmath135 . \n momentum @xmath135 is supposed to have only components along the neumann directions . \n an explicit form is given by @xmath136   \\nonumber \\\\ & & ~~ \\times   \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\exp \\left [   -\\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha'}{2 } } \\frac{1}{n}k_{\\mu }      ( \\alpha_{n}^{\\mu}z^{-n }              + \\tilde{\\alpha}_{n}^{\\mu}\\bar{z}^{-n } ) \\right ] . \n \\label{closed - string tachyon vertex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to discuss the bogolubov transform it is convenient to write down the transforms of oscillator modes of the string coordinates . \n these can be read as : @xmath137 for @xmath138 . \n the modes @xmath139 and @xmath140 for @xmath141 are kept intact . \n ( we put @xmath142 . ) \n the above mixture of the creation- and annihilation - modes makes the transform @xmath143 singular at @xmath7 or equivalently , since we put @xmath144 , at @xmath145 . \n it can be written in the following form for @xmath146 : @xmath147 here we introduce a local operator @xmath148 which we interpret as the bogolubov transform of @xmath9 . \n it takes the form of @xmath149 where @xmath150 and @xmath151 are operators consisting only of the creation modes : @xmath152    singularity of @xmath153 comes from the factor @xmath154 in eq.([transform of vt ] ) . \n because of this factor , the transform ( [ transform of vt ] ) becomes singular at @xmath7 where the boundary state @xmath155 is located . \n as will be seen soon , this factor should be subtracted in our construction of open - string tachyon vertex operator from a closed - string local operator . \n this factor can therefore be regarded as a renormalization factor of open - string tachyon vertex operator under its interpretation in terms of closed - string . putting this factor aside for a while , \n let us examine the operators @xmath148 . \n we first discuss their operator product expansion ( ope ) . \n it is convenient to recall the ope between closed - string tachyon vertex operators . \n it can be read from the expansion ( [ closed - string tachyon vertex ] ) as follows : @xmath156 for @xmath157 and @xmath158 . \n the ope under consideration changes from eq.([ope vt ] ) . \n the modification comes from operator products between @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath9 . \n it can be calculated by using the expansions ( [ n and tilded n ] ) . \n we finally obtain : @xmath161 for @xmath162 and @xmath163 . here \n @xmath164 is green s function on the unit disk @xmath165 in the presence of a constant @xmath0 field . \n it is defined by @xmath166 the rhs can be evaluated by using the bogolubov transforms ( [ transforms of massive modes ] ) and written down explicitly as follows : @xmath167    let us recall that a system only of closed - strings admits a holomorphic factorization . particularly there is no correlation between chiral and anti - chiral pieces , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , of string coordinates @xmath170 . \n the factorized term of @xmath171 in eq.([disk green function ] ) is a sum of the correlations @xmath172 and @xmath173 . \n the second and third terms are not factorized and they are respectively the correlations @xmath174 and @xmath175 . \n these correlations are characteristic of open - string theory . \n green s function provides a nice description of the singular factor in eq.([transform of vt ] ) . using this terminology \n we can write it as follows : @xmath176 where the first equality follows from eq.([transform of vt ] ) and @xmath177 . \n taking account of this expression , the transform ( [ transform of vt ] ) indicates that boundary states give rise to extra correlations , i.e.  correlations between the chiral and the anti - chiral sectors , by the amount of @xmath178 . \n in the presence of the world - sheet boundary , or equivalently in the open - closed mixed system , correlations between the chiral and anti - chiral sectors exist even in the closed string sector , and we need to take care of them . as pointed out in @xcite , this is a direct result of the fact that boundary states on the unit circle reflect a vertex operator at @xmath179 making its mirror image at @xmath180 : @xmath181 ( see also @xcite ) . \n this brings about a short distance singularity at the boundary @xmath182 . \n since we intend to construct open - string vertex operators in terms of closed - string , we need to carry out a renormalization to manage this type of singularity . \n the ope ( [ ope renormalized tachyon vertex ] ) itself strongly suggests an interpretation of @xmath148 from the open - string viewpoint . to pursue such a possibility we introduce a renormalized tachyon vertex operator @xmath183 by subtracting the above singular factor : @xmath184 in other words we have @xmath185 we call @xmath186 renormalized _ open - string _ tachyon vertex operator with momentum @xmath135 . \n the action ( [ kn on lim ren vt ] ) is completely the same as the action of the virasoro algebra on open - string tachyon vertex operator with the same momentum . \n in addition to the ope ( [ ope renormalized tachyon vertex ] ) this is the reason why we identify @xmath204 with renormalized open - string tachyon vertex operators . \n we can also make the above consideration in terms of boundary states . \n let us consider the state @xmath205 . by using the relation ( [ def2 of ren vt ] ) \n we can write it in a form , @xmath206 @xmath207 . \n an explicit form of @xmath208 has been given in eq.([normal ordered transformed vt ] ) . \n thereby we can express the state in the oscillator representation and then take the limit @xmath195 without ambiguity . \n we call thus obtained state @xmath209 . \n it turns out to have the following form : @xmath210 g_{n}|k \\rangle . \n \\nonumber \\\\   \\label{one tachyon bn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we express the normalization factor of @xmath211 in terms of the open - string tensors . \n this translation is done by using the identity , @xmath212 , which also follows from eq.([def of g and theta ] ) . \n action of @xmath187 on this state can be obtained from eq.([kn on lim ren vt ] ) . \n it can be read as @xmath213 for @xmath189 . \n the ishibashi condition imposed on @xmath214 , i.e.  vanishing of the rhs of the above equation for an arbitrary @xmath215 , ( strictly speaking , modulo a total derivative with respect to @xmath216 ) , requires @xmath217 . \n it is the on - shell condition of open - string tachyon . \n the action of @xmath187 on the boundary state has an interpretation in terms of string field theory . \n fundamental ingredient in string field theory is a brst charge @xmath218 . \n it is a grassmann - odd operator obeying the usual relations , @xmath219 and @xmath220 , where @xmath47 and @xmath221 are respectively total energy - momentum tensor and anti - ghost field of a world - sheet theory . in the case of bosonic closed - string field theory \n @xcite world - sheet theory consists of closed - string coordinates @xmath222 ( a matter system ) and the world - sheet reparametrization ghosts . \n the ghost system is described by @xmath223 for the chiral part and @xmath224 for the anti - chiral part . \n closed - string brst charge @xmath225 is decomposed into @xmath226 . \n the chiral part @xmath227 has the following form : @xmath228 where @xmath229 are the virasoro generators of the matter and the ghost systems . @xmath230 and @xmath231 are the fourier modes of ghost and anti - ghost fields : @xmath232 and @xmath233 . \n the anti - chiral part @xmath234 has the same form as the above except replacing the chiral quantities with the anti - chiral ones . \n these @xmath227 and @xmath234 are nilpotent independently and satisfy the relations , @xmath235 and @xmath236 . here \n @xmath237 and @xmath238 are the virasoro generators of the total system . \n let @xmath239 and @xmath240 be respectively the hilbert spaces of matter and ghost systems . \n we put @xmath241 . \n closed - string hilbert space @xmath242 consists of vectors @xmath243 of @xmath244 which satisfy the conditions , @xmath245 necessity of the two conditions is explained in @xcite from the perspective of two - dimensional conformal field theories . \n now we want to interpret the state @xmath246 as a state of the closed - string hilbert space . \n since it is a boundary state of the neumann directions we first extend it to a vector of @xmath239 by tensoring the boundary state ( [ state bd ] ) of the dirichlet directions . \n as for the ghost sector an appropriate state is known . \n it is given @xcite by @xmath247 and satisfies the following boundary conditions : @xmath248 for @xmath189 . \n it can be seen from these conditions that @xmath249 satisfies the ishibashi condition . further tensoring the ghost boundary state we obtain @xmath250 of @xmath244 . \n we call it @xmath251 . \n this state satisfies the first condition in eq.([state condition of closed - string ] ) because of eq.([boundary condition bghost ] ) . \n as for the second , the @xmath252 case of eq.([kn on one tachyon bn ] ) gives @xmath253 @xmath254 . \n this means that we need to integrate over @xmath216 to regard the state as a vector of @xmath242 . \n the above action can be identified with the brst transformation of open - string tachyon vertex operator . \n @xmath259 in eq.([qc on one tachyon b ] ) correspond to the same modes of ghost field appearing in open - string field theory . \n actually eq.([qc on one tachyon b ] ) is an example of the formula given in @xcite . \n it states that the closed - string brst charge @xmath225 acts on boundary states as the generator of the brst transformation of open - string field . \n it is used there to show a macroscopic description of the cubic open - string field theory is given by a boundary open - string field theory . \n we wish to interpret these states as boundary states with off - shell open - string tachyons . \n this is verified by comparing closed - string tree propagations between these states with the corresponding open - string one - loop amplitudes and testing their coincidence . \n these will be done in the next subsection . \n it is worth mentioning that the present construction is also applicable in a vanishing @xmath0 field background and in particular the boundary states ( [ m open - string tachyon boundary state ] ) become available just by putting @xmath285 .      to describe the closed - string propagations we need the dual boundary states . \n although they are given by the bpz conjugation , we apply the previous formalism to their construction as well in order to gain some insight into them . instead of \n @xmath132 we use the bpz dual : @xmath286    the transform of tachyon vertex operator is given by @xmath287 . \n it can be written in the following form for @xmath288 : @xmath289 here we introduce a local operator @xmath290 , which we interpret as the ( dual ) bogolubov transform of @xmath291 . \n it takes the form of @xmath292 where @xmath293 and @xmath294 are operators consisting only of the annihilation modes : @xmath295 singularity of @xmath287 comes from @xmath296 in eq . \n ( [ dual transform of vt ] ) . \n it becomes the same as the singular factor appearing in eq.([transform of vt ] ) after changing the coordinate @xmath179 to @xmath297 . \n similar calculation to what is made to obtain eq.([ope renormalized tachyon vertex ] ) leads to the ope : @xmath298 for @xmath162 and @xmath163 . here \n @xmath299 is green s function on the unit disk @xmath162 . \n it is defined by @xmath300 and written down explicitly as follows : @xmath301    similarly to eq.([eq : singular factor as self - contraction of vt ] ) , the singular factor appearing in eq.([dual transform of vt ] ) is expressed as the self - contraction of @xmath302 between its chiral and anti - chiral parts . \n this may be seen as follows . \n let @xmath303 be the chiral  anti - chiral correlation of green s function @xmath304  : @xmath305 . \n using this quantity , we can write the singular factor as @xmath306    dual of the renormalized open - string tachyon operator , which we call @xmath307 , is given by subtracting the singular factor appearing in eq.([dual transform of vt ] ) as follows : @xmath308 we remark that the @xmath187 action on the dual vertex operator reduces to eq.([kn on lim ren vt ] ) after we take the limit @xmath309 . \n let us describe the dual boundary state . \n it is obtained by following the same route as taken for eq.([m open - string tachyon boundary state ] ) . \n let @xmath310 ( @xmath262 ) be the dual vertex operators . \n let @xmath311 be distinct points on the infinite semi - cylinder satisfying the condition , @xmath312 . \n we consider the state @xmath313 and take the limit @xmath314 . \n thus obtained state , which we call @xmath315 , is the dual . \n explicitly it is given by @xmath316 . \n \\nonumber \\\\ \n \\label{m open - string tachyon dual boundary state } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the hamiltonian operator of closed - string is @xmath317 . \n we can conveniently parametrize propagations of closed - string by @xmath102 . the evolution by an imaginary time @xmath103 is given by the operator @xmath318 , where we put @xmath106 . in this subsection \n we only consider the propagations along the neumann directions . \n propagations of closed - string between the boundary states

- string one - loop calculation it is convenient to write down the amplitudes ( [ pre tachyon amplitude by boundary state ] ) by using the elliptic @xmath327-functions . \n appropriate @xmath327-functions are @xmath328 . \n they have the following representations : @xmath329 where we put @xmath330 . \n the amplitudes ( [ tachyon amplitude by boundary state ] ) , combined with closed - string propagations along the dirichlet directions , should be compared with open - string tachyon one - loop amplitudes . \n we begin this subsection with a brief exposition on the open - string calculation in a constant @xmath0 field background of closed - string . \n related with a prescription of normal orderings relative to the @xmath362-invariant vacuum of open - string , it is convenient to introduce @xcite commutative zero - modes @xmath363 instead of the non - commutative ones . \n they satisfy the standard canonical relations ; @xmath364= [ \\hat{p}_0^{\\mu},\\hat{p}_0^{\\nu}]=0 $ ] and @xmath365=i g^{\\mu \\nu } $ ] . in what follows \n we adopt the standard normal ordering of @xmath366 . \n it is also denoted by @xmath367 . \n the virasoro generators @xmath368 can be obtained from the energy - momentum tensor @xmath369 by @xmath370 . \n they turn out to have the following forms : @xmath371 where we put @xmath372 . among these generators \n open - string propagator is given by @xmath373 . \n evolution of open - string on the upper half - plane is described by @xmath374 due to an integral representation @xmath375 . \n it is useful to observe the open - string coordinates , particularly @xmath376 , at the boundary of the world - sheet . \n we may use the radial coordinates @xmath377 , where @xmath378 , as a parametrization of the upper half - plane . \n they can be read as follows : @xmath379 at both boundaries @xmath380 and @xmath381 , effect of the non - commutativity of the world - volume ( the @xmath327-dependence ) is encoded only in the zero modes while the massive part acquires the standard mode expansion . \n open - string amplitudes are correlation functions between local operators inserted at the boundaries . \n it follows from eq.([open - string at boundary ] ) that @xmath327-dependence of local operators such as tachyon- and gluon - vertices are encoded only in their zero modes . \n one - loop amplitudes can be obtained in the operator formalism simply by taking a trace of these operators with the propagators inserting among them . \n the integral representation of the propagator may be used . \n the zero mode dependent part decouples from the others in @xmath374 . \n therefore , for the particular cases of tachyons and gluons , only the zero - modes of open - string are influenced by the non - commutativity of the world - volume . \n let us consider one - loop amplitudes of tachyon vertex operators . \n we introduce open - string tachyon vertex operator of momentum @xmath135 by @xmath382 we consider the scattering process of @xmath383 tachyons with momenta @xmath384 . \n it is worth noting that the momenta @xmath384 have only components along the neumann directions . \n it is because the propagation of open - string is restricted along the d - brane world - volume . \n diagram describing the one - loop scattering process can be drawn on the upper half - plane as depicted in figure [ upper - half - plane ] . \n an open - string evolves along the radial direction from the outer semi - circle to the inner one and interacts with the tachyon vertices at its ends . \n two semi - circles are identified with each other and thereby the diagrams is interpreted as an open - string one - loop . the corresponding tachyon amplitude , which we call @xmath385 , is given by a sum of traces of their products arranged in cyclically distinct orders with keeping their partial cyclic orderings at the both ends : @xmath386 we can evaluate the amplitude in the standard manner . \n let us recall that the tachyon vertex operator enjoys the properties : @xmath387 combined with the integral form of @xmath388 , this enables us to write the amplitude as follows : @xmath389 the coordinates @xmath390 , which appear in the rhs as insertion points of the tachyon vertices , can be thought to provide a parametrization of the diagram . \n another parametrization may be obtained by mapping the diagram to a cylinder with width @xmath391 . \n see figure [ open - string diagram ] . \n two bold vertical lines are identified with each other.,height=529 ]    correspondingly @xmath390 are mapped to @xmath392 by @xmath393 . \n we put @xmath394 . \n we may use @xmath16 instead of @xmath395 . \n the evolution of open - string becomes manifest in this parameterization . in the figure \n an open - string with width @xmath391 evolves along the real axis from the origin to @xmath396 , interacting with the tachyon vertices inserted at @xmath392 or @xmath397 .        to compare the open - string one - loop amplitude ( [ tachyon one - loop by open - string parameters ] ) with eq.([tachyon amplitude by boundary state ] ) we map the cylinder drawn on the @xmath402-plane ( figure [ open - string diagram ] ) to a cylinder with width @xmath403 on the @xmath404-plane by the conformal transformation @xmath405 . \n see figure [ closed - string diagram ] . \n two bold vertical lines are identified with each other.,height=529 ]    @xmath392 are mapped to @xmath406 by @xmath407 . \n we put @xmath408 . \n these provide a new parametrization of the diagram , which makes an evolution of closed - string manifest . \n a closed - string with circumference @xmath409 evolves along the imaginary axis , starting from the real axis where it interacts with @xmath260 open - string tachyons and ending on @xmath410 where it interacts with @xmath81 open - string tachyons . \n we note that the insertion point of the @xmath411-th open - string tachyon is fixed at @xmath412 . \n low - energy description of world - volume theories of @xmath31-brane can be obtained by taking a zero - slope limit @xmath13 so that it makes all perturbative stringy states ( @xmath14 ) of open - string infinitely heavy and decouple from the light states . \n low - energy effective theory relevant to open - string tachyons in the presence of a constant @xmath0 field is a scalar field theory on the non - commutative world - volume . in general , quantum field theories on \n a non - commutative space suffer the uv - ir mixing @xcite which originates in the non - commutativity . \n it causes @xcite a serious problem on the renormalization prescription of these theories . in this section , \n based on the results obtained so far , we investigate the uv behavior of the non - commutative scalar field theory . for this sake \n it is convenient to start with a brief description of the above zero - slope limit of the one - loop amplitudes of @xmath383 tachyons . \n our study in this section is restricted to the case of @xmath421-brane in the critical dimensions . \n eq.([open - string ftl of one - loop amplitude ] ) can be identified with one - loop amplitude of open - string tachyon @xmath430 ( a scalar particle of @xmath431 ) living on the non - commutative world - volume . \n it is the amplitude obtained from the corresponding one - loop feynman diagram consisting of @xmath383 trivalent vertices . \n each of the vertices represents the following cubic interaction : @xmath432 here we introduce the moyal product ( an associative non - commutative product ) by @xmath433 the feynman rule becomes a little complicated due to the above moyal products . \n but the feynman integral can be evaluated by using the standard technique @xcite and translated to eq.([open - string ftl of one - loop amplitude ] ) . \n we can find @xmath434 in the integral of eq.([open - string ftl of one - loop amplitude ] ) . \n the first term comes from the schwinger representation of the tachyon propagator , @xmath435 . \n this is the standard term which appears in ordinary field theory one - loop amplitudes . \n the second term can be understood @xcite as a uv regularization ( a regularization of the integration near @xmath436 ) . \n it is a curious regularization since it depends on the external momentum , @xmath437 . \n this feature can be thought of as a characteristic of quantum field theories on a non - commutative space and makes field theoretical description of physics at high energy scale difficult . \n it should be also noted that integrations in eq.([open - string ftl of one - loop amplitude ] ) have potential singularities at @xmath438 ( @xmath439 ) . \n these singularities can be already seen in the integral ( [ tachyon one - loop by open - string parameters ] ) . \n although we do not describe their regularization here , prescription used @xcite for the cubic open - string field theory will be effective . \n both parameters @xmath440 and @xmath441 are regarded as coordinates of the moduli space of conformal classes of cylinder with @xmath383 punctures at the boundaries . for each values of the closed - string parameters we obtain a graph \n as depicted in figure [ closed - string diagram ] . \n set of these graphs is the above moduli space . strictly speaking , these graphs are representatives of the conformal classes and thus it is possible to make different choices . for each values of the open - string parameters we obtain a graph as depicted in figure [ open - string diagram ] . \n it can be identified in the standard manner with a metrized trivalent one - loop ribbon graph . \n metric of the graph is given by the open - string parameters . \n these metrized ribbon graphs can be chosen as the representatives . \n therefore the open - string parameters give another set of coordinates of the moduli space . \n the above moduli space has several ends . \n typically we have two ends at @xmath25 and @xmath18 . \n the previous zero - slope limit of open - string is related with the end at the infinity as can be seen from eq.([schwinger parameters of scalar field theory ] ) . \n actual procedure to obtain the zero - slope limit ( [ open - string ftl of one - loop amplitude ] ) shows that the field theory amplitude is a suitable magnification of the integral ( [ tachyon one - loop by open - string parameters ] ) on an infinitesimal neighbourhood around this end . \n we want to know the uv behavior of the world - volume theory . \n for such a purpose we need to focus on the region @xmath442 . \n one possible resolution may be obtained by taking a zero - slope limit such that it magnifies an infinitesimal neighbourhood around another end located at @xmath25 . near this end use of the closed - string parameters \n will be effective as the open - string parameters near the infinity . \n let us examine a zero - slope limit which will be taken by fixing the following parameters : @xmath443 in the course of taking the limit we also fix open - string tensors @xmath200 and @xmath201 in order to capture the world - volume theory . \n it follows from eq.([equalities2 and 3 ] ) that this makes the limit different from the standard field theory limit of closed - string . \n transformation between the open- and the closed - string parameters leads @xmath444 and @xmath445 . for @xmath23 and @xmath406 to remain finite the original field theory parameters need to satisfy @xmath446 and @xmath447 . \n we can not neglect effects of all the perturbative stringy states of open - string at such a trans - string scale . \n hence the limit in question includes their effects . \n it is important to compare the above zero - slope limit with the previous one . in eq.([closed - string ftl of one - loop amplitude ] ) the schwinger propagator @xmath459 is integrated and gives rise to the propagator of _ closed - string tachyon _ of momentum @xmath460 , while the counterpart in eq.([open - string ftl of one - loop amplitude ] ) consists of two parts one of which is standard in field theories and the other is a curious regularization factor originated in the non - commutativity . \n the factors @xmath461^{k_{\\mu}^{(r)}g^{\\mu \\nu}k_{\\nu}^{(s ) } }   $ ] found in eq.([open - string ftl of one - loop amplitude ] ) describe correlations between two open - string tachyons inserted at @xmath423 and @xmath462 in the schwinger time . \n these correlations are made by propagations of open - string tachyon between them and particularly have their origin in kinetic energy @xmath463 of the propagating open - string tachyon . \n these correlations are lost in eq.([closed - string ftl of one - loop amplitude ] ) . \n this indicates that open - string tachyon becomes topological at the trans - string scale and that it is described by a one - dimensional topological field theory . \n vanishing of the correlations originates in the modular transforms ( [ modular trans of tachyon correlations ] ) . \n so this is a stringy effect . \n we now consider generating function of amplitudes ( [ def of jt ] ) and examine the zero - slope limit . \n let @xmath464 be the fourier modes of open - string tachyon field : @xmath465 since it is a real scalar field , the fourier modes satisfy @xmath466 , where the overline denotes complex conjugation . \n we examine the zero - slope limit of the following generating function : @xmath467        a factorization of one - loop amplitudes of non - commutative scalar field theory is considered in @xcite@xcite and claimed there to be realized at the low - energy of this field theory by using the path - ordered exponentials . \n the procedure of the zero - slope limit adopted in those papers are quite different form that of the present paper . \n our limiting procedure is not the conventional one to obtain the field theory limit of open - string . \n in fact the present limit would reduce to the field theory limit of closed - string if the @xmath0 field were vanishing . \n we would like to emphasize that the existence of the @xmath0 field makes the limit different from the conventional field theory limit of closed - string . \n we make a digression from the previous discussion on the world - volume theory . in this section we introduce coordinate and momentum eigenstates of closed - string and make some observation on their relation with the boundary states . \n these eigenstates will play important roles in the subsequent discussions . \n we begin with a simple remark on closed - string momentum currents . \n these currents are introduced by taking functional derivatives of the action : @xmath484 }        { \\delta \\partial_{\\tau }               x^{m}(\\sigma,\\tau ) } $ ] . \n we have two expressions of the action , ( [ eq : action1 ] ) and ( [ eq : action2 ] ) . \n they provide two momentum currents , which coincide for the dirichlet directions but become slightly different from each other for the neumann directions . \n when the action ( [ eq : action2 ] ) is used one obtains @xmath485 while the action ( [ eq : action1 ] ) leads to @xmath486 their conserved charges become the same , that is , momentum @xmath483 , since these are integrals of the currents over the circle . \n whichever momentum current one adopts as the conjugate variable of @xmath487 , canonical quantization of closed - string leads to the same commutation relations ( [ eq : ccr ] ) . \n let @xmath488 be closed - string coordinate operators . \n they are simply given by @xmath489 . \n the conjugate momentum operators @xmath490 are those operators satisfying @xmath491 @xmath492 $ ] @xmath493 . ] ] these are given by the above momentum currents . \n due to the existence of two different currents we have two operators , @xmath494 and @xmath495 . \n all these operators are periodic with respect to @xmath216 \n . we may provide their mode expansions similar to eq.([eq : modex ] ) . \n for the later discussion these turn out to be inconvenient . \n instead we use the following mode expansions : @xmath496~ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\hat{p}^{(b)}_{m}(\\sigma ) & = & \\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\left [       \\hat{p}_{0 m }       +       \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } }          \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty }            \\left (

operators}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath497 , @xmath498 and @xmath499 are the hermitian conjugates of the corresponding ones . \n their commutation relations can be read as follows :

scheme leads the following identities : ; @xmath577 , @xmath578 etc . ] \n @xmath579 and thus we obtain @xmath580    it is important to recall that the boundary state @xmath581 is an eigenstate of @xmath582 with eigenvalues @xmath583 . \n we have @xmath584 . \n if one uses the zeta - function regularization and adopts the above @xmath585 as the normalization constant , these two states become precisely identical : @xmath586    let us also recall that in quantum mechanics of a single particle , coordinate eigenstates @xmath587 are described by @xmath588 , where @xmath589 is the momentum operator . \n one may find an analogous realization for the string coordinate eigenstates . taking account of eq.([bd as xd ] ) one can infer the following one : @xmath590 where @xmath591 is the state ( [ bd as xd ] ) with @xmath592 . \n this turns out to be the case . \n using the previous parametrization of the eigenvalues one can find @xmath593 it is easy to see that the normal ordered exponential in the rhs of eq.([eq : x - shift ] ) reproduces @xmath566 . \n the formula ( [ eq : ee ] ) may be useful . \n the above discussion is also applicable to the string momentum eigenstates .

use the above @xmath600 as the normalization constant , these two states become identical including their normalizations : @xmath601    momentum eigenstates can be realized in the quantum mechanics by @xmath602 , where @xmath603 is the position operator . \n we can find an analogous realization of the string momentum eigenstates . \n it turns out to be as follows : @xmath604\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times      : \\exp\\left(i\\int^{2\\pi}_{0}d\\sigma \n p^{(b)}_{\\mu}(\\sigma )                 \\hat{x}^{\\mu}(\\sigma)\\right ) :      { \\bigl |}b_{n}{\\bigr\\rangle}~.      \\label{eq : pnb - shift}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the later convenience we provide a similar observation for the eigenstates @xmath605 as well . \n let @xmath606 be the state which is obtained from the neumann boundary state @xmath607 by putting @xmath285 : @xmath608 this is the neumann boundary state in a vanishing @xmath0 field background . \n one can readily find that this is an eigenstate of @xmath609 with zero eigenvalue : @xmath610 and hence @xmath611 . \n comparing definitions ( [ eq : pn - state ] ) and ( [ eq : bn with zero b ] ) , we find that these states coincide with each other including their normalizations , if we adopt @xmath612 in eq.([cpb ] ) as the normalization of the momentum eigenstates . \n concerning the state @xmath605 , a similar formula to eq.([eq : pnb - shift ] ) becomes @xmath613    \\ , : \\exp \\left(i \n \\int^{2\\pi}_{0 } d\\sigma                           p_{\\mu}(\\sigma ) \\hat{x}^{\\mu}(\\sigma )                      \\right ) :       \\left| b_{n } \\right\\rangle_{b=0}~.       \\label{eq : pn - shift}\\ ] ] this has the same form as eq.([eq : pnb - shift ] ) with putting @xmath285 . \n at the zero - slope limit , which is introduced in eq.([field theory parameters of closed - string ] ) and its below in order to capture the uv behavior of the world - volume theory , the generating function of one - loop amplitudes of open - string tachyons is shown to exhibit the factorized form ( [ closed - string ftl by straight open wilson lines ] ) . \n it is expressed as a sum of products of two wilson lines ( strictly speaking , their analogues ) along the same straight lines @xmath470 , multiplying the propagators of closed - string tachyon . \n this shows that closed - string tachyon @xmath614 has a tadpole interaction with the open wilson line . \n it can be written in a form , @xmath615 $ ] . \n its origin in string theory can be found in eq.([def of jt ] ) . \n the interaction simply comes from the closed - string tachyon modes of boundary states , @xmath616 @xmath617 @xmath618 . \n actually these boundary states have all the components of perturbative closed - string states . at the level of string amplitudes all of them \n propagate between the boundary states and contribute to the amplitudes . \n it is shown in @xcite that the straight open wilson line can couple with the on - shell graviton and , as will be seen in the later section , it can be generalized to the off - shell . \n this indicates that all the perturbative closed - string states have tadpole interactions with the open wilson line . \n therefore we may unfasten the zero - slope limit ( [ closed - string ftl by straight open wilson lines ] ) so that propagations of all these states are made manifest . in this section \n we pursue such a possibility . \n we also restrict to the case of @xmath421-brane in the critical dimensions . \n let us provide a general perspective on this issue before we start calculations . \n first of all , it can be expected @xcite that closed - string propagations including gravitons fluctuate the straight line appearing in eq.([closed - string ftl by moyal products ] ) and transform it into curved ones . in other words \n we can expect that there are correlations between their deviations from the straight line and the propagations of closed - string states . \n these curves will appear as the corresponding wilson lines , and we may factorize the generating function into a sum of these products at the zero - slope limit . \n analogously to the standard factorization of closed - string amplitudes the sum must be taken originally over the perturbative closed - string states . \n the above correspondence between curves and states will enable us to translate the sum as an integral over the space of curves . \n this integral may be suppressed by a suitable weight as the straight line is suppressed in eq.([closed - string ftl by straight open wilson lines ] ) by the closed - string tachyon propagator . \n it is amazing that one can interpret the tachyon propagator as a propagator of the straight open wilson line by notifying @xmath619 . \n the factorization ( [ closed - string ftl by straight open wilson lines ] ) may be obtained from the aforementioned integral by integrating out the fluctuations . \n we may say that the straight open wilson line is the average .      in order to justify the above perspective \n let us first factorize the string amplitudes by an insertion of a partition of unity . \n use of that constructed from closed - string momentum eigenstates turns out to be relevant . \n it is given in eq.([partition unity by pn ] ) as @xmath620~    \\langle p_n | , $ ] where the eigenvalue @xmath621 is parametrized by @xmath622 $ ] . \n ^{2\\alpha'k_{\\mu}^{(r)}g^{\\mu \\nu}k_{\\nu}^{(s ) } } \\times   \\prod_{m+1 \\leq r < s \\leq m+n }       the above factorization may be compared with the previous expression of the amplitudes . \n terms in the first four lines can be found exactly in eq.([pre tachyon amplitude by boundary state ] ) . \n the other terms describe a factorization of @xmath324 in the same equation . \n if we integrate out @xmath628 and @xmath629 they provide eq.([result on f ] ) . \n these variables describe fluctuations of @xmath621 . \n corresponding degrees of freedom of closed - string are given by the massive modes . \n the factorization of @xmath324 in terms of those complex variables are plausible since @xmath324 is the sum of contributions of these massive modes . \n we examine the zero - slope limit of the factorization ( [ momentum factorization of tachyon amplitude ] ) . \n the limit we discuss is same as that investigated previously to capture the uv behavior of the world - volume theory . \n it is taken by fixing parameters @xmath630 and @xmath406 besides the open - string tensors . \n we also keep @xmath625 and @xmath631 intact . \n they do not scale under the limit . \n it should be noticed that the complex variables used originally to parametrize @xmath621 do scale under the limit . \n this is because @xmath625 and @xmath631 in ( [ momentum factorization of tachyon amplitude ] ) are the rescaled ones introduced by multiplying the original variables by @xmath632 . \n we first focus on the integral over @xmath625 and @xmath631 in eq.([momentum factorization of tachyon amplitude ] ) . \n let us start by considering the first exponential in the integral . scaling part in the exponent \n is expressed by means of the closed - string tensors and @xmath633 . \n it has the form : @xmath634 dominant contribution at the limit clearly comes from the first term : @xmath635 where we use equalities ( [ equalities2 and 3 ] ) . \n we turn to the determinant factors , which is also described by the closed - string tensors . \n their contributions can be read as follows : @xmath636 \\approx \\left (     \\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\right)^{26 } \\mbox{det } \\left[-   \\frac{\\theta g \\theta }       { 8\\pi^2nq_c^{\\frac{n}{2}}\\alpha ' } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the other two exponentials in the integral have similar forms . \n it is enough to know the behavior of @xmath637 in their exponents . \n it can be read by using eq.([def of g and theta ] ) as follows : @xmath638 as we studied previously , contributions of the first four lines in the factorization ( [ momentum factorization of tachyon amplitude ] ) are to give rise to the straight open wilson lines . \n the last pieces we need to estimate are the exponentials whose exponents are bilinear of @xmath639 with the weights , @xmath640 . \n it is enough to know the behavior of these weights . again using eqs . \n ( [ def of g and theta ] ) and ( [ equalities2 and 3 ] ) it can be read as @xmath641 @xmath642 . \n thus we can neglect these pieces in the zero - slope limit . \n the integration of @xmath662 are suppressed exponentially compared with @xmath470 . \n it can be accomplished by replacing the integration variables with their mean values and becomes unity at the zero - slope limit . \n then the above factorization reduces to that by the straight open wilson lines . \n our study of gauge theory starts from this section . \n an analogue of gluon vertex operator of open - string is introduced in closed - string theory . \n investigation of its bogolubov transformation leads a renormalization of this operator . \n it will be shown that the renormalized operator enjoys the standard properties of ( open - string ) gluon vertex operator , including the action of the virasoro algebra . \n these operators , acting on the neumann boundary state , give rise to boundary states which turn out to be identified with the boundary states of ( open - string ) off - shell gluons . \n in particular we will show that closed - string tree amplitudes between these states coincide with the corresponding gluon one - loop amplitudes of open - string . \n our discussion in this section goes almost parallel to section [ sec : tachyon boundary state ] where the boundary states of off - shell open - string tachyons are constructed .      in closed - string theory an analogue of gluon - vertex operator \n may be taken as @xmath667 where @xmath668-vectors @xmath669 and @xmath670 are the momentum and the polarization vectors . \n the polarization vector is the fourier transform of @xmath479 gauge field @xmath671 : @xmath672 the gauge field takes value in @xmath673 . \n this yields @xmath674 . while we concentrate on @xmath479 gauge group in this paper , it can be straightforwardly generalized to @xmath675 by assigning the chan - paton indices . \n let us express the above operator in an auxiliary form . \n this often makes subsequent calculation facile . \n let @xmath676 be an auxiliary parameter . \n we write the operator in an exponential form : @xmath677 with @xmath678 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad     \\times \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty }     \\exp

that the terms proportional to higher powers of @xmath679 become irrelevant to the amplitudes . \n we consider the bogolubov transformation for @xmath680 generated by @xmath681 given in eq.([gn ] ) . using ( [ transforms of massive modes ] ) we can write down the transform as follows : @xmath682 where @xmath683~.     \\label{r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the operator @xmath684 is defined to be @xmath685 where @xmath686 and @xmath687 consist of the creation modes alone and take the forms of @xmath688    in the transform ( [ transform of hvg ] ) we can find the same singularity structure as that of the tachyon . \n it is due to the factor @xmath689 , which is responsible for the singularity of the transform ( [ transform of hvg ] ) at the world - sheet boundary , @xmath690 . \n this factor contains an exponential in addition to the same factor which appeared in the transform @xmath691 . \n let us make a few comments about this extra factor . \n the first term of the exponent is proportional to @xmath679 . \n the closed - string tensor @xmath692 used there is translated into @xmath693 . \n the second term becomes irrelevant since it is proportional to @xmath694 . \n therefore the net effect of this extra factor is to give a term proportional to @xmath327 . particularly in the absence of a constant @xmath0 field \n , @xmath695 reduces to that of the tachyon . \n the singular factor which appears in the transform of the tachyon vertex operator has been expressed in eq.([eq : singular factor as self - contraction of vt ] ) as the self - contraction between the chiral and the anti - chiral parts of @xmath9 . in the present case \n as well , we can think of the singular factor as such a self - contraction of @xmath696 . \n in fact , we can express @xmath689 by using the chiral  anti - chiral correlation @xmath697 of green s function @xmath698 as follows : @xmath699~.     \\label{r in terms of green function}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as mentioned in the analysis of tachyon , boundary states induce correlations between the chiral and the anti - chiral sectors , and this feature is characteristic of systems of interacting closed- and open - strings . \n we wish to find out a relation between @xmath700 and open - string gluon vertex operators . \n previous discussions to establish the relation between @xmath701 and open - string tachyon vertex operators consist of : i ) description of the ope between @xmath701 , which turns out to be given in ( [ ope renormalized tachyon vertex ] ) by using green s function @xmath698 and allows us to introduce the renormalized open - string tachyon vertex operators @xmath183 , ii ) description of the diff@xmath702 action on @xmath183 , which turns out to reduce at the boundary to the standard virasoro action on open - string tachyon vertex operators , and iii ) reproduction of open - string one - loop tachyon amplitudes by the boundary state formalism . \n we repeat these analyses as for gluons in the following . \n let us examine the ope between @xmath703 . \n it is convenient to start with the ope between the auxiliary operators . \n the standard calculation leads to @xmath704 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad \\ ;

since @xmath703 have the form given in ( [ normal ordered transformed hvg ] ) , we can obtain their ope from the above by taking account of the opes between @xmath707 and @xmath708 . \n we find that @xmath709 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad \\ ; \\times     : \\mbox{ad}_{g_{n}^{-1 } }     { \\hat{v}_{a}}\\left(\\sigma_{1},\\tau_{1};k^{(1)};a_{1 }                   \\right)\\ ; \\mbox{ad}_{g_{n}^{-1 } }

direct extension of the tachyon case ( [ ope renormalized tachyon vertex ] ) and suggests an interpretation of @xmath703 in terms of the gluon vertex operator . \n let us introduce the renormalized operator @xmath711 by the following subtraction : @xmath712 in other words , @xmath713 in addition to the subtraction of the singular factor @xmath689 , a finite subtraction is made in the above by the multiplication of @xmath714 . \n although it vanishes in the absence of @xmath0 field , this factor becomes surely necessary in general . without this subtraction \n we can not reproduce even the standard virasoro action which we present below . \n the renormalized operator ( [ def of renormalized hvg ] ) gives rise to @xmath715 by the relation ( [ vg and hvg ] ) . \n we refer to @xmath716 as renormalized gluon vertex operator with momentum @xmath669 and polarization @xmath670 . \n it can be written as follows : @xmath717 where @xmath302 @xmath718 is the closed - string tachyon vertex operator . \n next we will examine the action of diff@xmath702 on the above renormalized operators . as a shortcut we use the description in terms of boundary states . \n relevant states are

@xmath782 . \n we compare the amplitudes ( [ aux gluon amplitude by boundary state ] ) , taking account of closed - string propagations along the dirichlet directions , with open - string gluon one - loop amplitudes . \n the discussion goes parallel to the case of the tachyon . \n we first describe the open - string calculation . \n we use the same conventions as in subsection [ sec : open - string tachyon one - loop ] . \n open - string gluon vertex operator of momentum @xmath135 is given by @xmath783 where @xmath784 and @xmath377 are respectively the complex and the radial coordinates of the upper half - plane ( open - string world sheet ) . \n @xmath670 are the polarization vectors or the fourier modes of the @xmath479 gauge field @xmath785 . \n we consider the scattering process of @xmath383 gluons with momenta @xmath384 . \n diagram relevant to the one - loop scattering process can be drawn on the upper half - plane as depicted in figure [ upper - half - plane ] . \n the corresponding gluon amplitude , which we call @xmath786 , is given by a sum of traces of their products arranged in cyclically distinct orders with keeping their partial orderings at the each end : @xmath787    in order to obtain the above amplitude it becomes convenient to introduce the gluon vertex operator in an exponential form . \n let @xmath676 be an auxiliary parameter . \n we put @xcite @xmath788 this operator is related with the vertex operator ( [ def of open - string gluon vertex ] ) by @xmath789 the corresponding amplitude constructed from @xmath790 instead of @xmath791 will be called @xmath792 . \n it is given by @xmath793 the gluon scattering amplitude @xmath794 can be obtained from @xmath792 by differentiating it with respect to @xmath795 and making them vanish : @xmath796      we can evaluate the amplitude @xmath792 in the standard manner . \n the open - string propagators in ( [ def of open - string aux gluon amplitude ] ) may be replaced by the integral forms . \n the above virasoro action implies : @xmath801 utilizing these properties we can write the amplitude in the following form : @xmath802 the coordinates @xmath390 in the rhs are insertion points of the auxiliary gluon vertices and provide a parametrization of the diagram . \n another parametrization can be obtained by mapping the diagram to the cylinder with width @xmath391 as depicted in figure [ open - string diagram ] . \n correspondingly @xmath390 are mapped to @xmath392 by @xmath393 . \n we put @xmath394 . \n these are the open - string parameters . \n low - energy world - volume theory of open - string gluons in the presence of a constant @xmath0 field is a @xmath479 gauge theory on the non - commutative world - volume . in this section , taking the same route as the previous study of the non - commutative scalar field theory , we investigate the uv behavior of the non - commutative gauge theory . \n our study in this section is restricted to the case of @xmath421-brane in the critical dimensions . \n we examine two zero - slope limits of the one - loop amplitudes of gluons . \n one is based on the open - string parameters and the other is on the closed - string parameters . \n these two limits , as we explained in the study of the non - commutative scalar field theory , are complementary . \n we first take a zero - slope limit based on the open - string parameters @xmath440 . \n eq.([aux gluon one - loop by open - string parameters ] ) may be used as an integral form of the amplitude . \n strictly speaking , the amplitude is obtained from this integral by using the relation ( [ ia by hatia ] ) . \n the zero - slope limit will be a gauge theory one - loop amplitude , particularly written in terms of the schwinger parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath423 . \n these parameters are related with @xmath16 and @xmath392 by the relations ( [ schwinger parameters of scalar field theory ] ) . \n the auxiliary parameters @xmath795 are also used in the amplitude ( [ aux gluon one - loop by open - string parameters ] ) . \n they are introduced in order to describe the gluon vertex operators ( [ def of open - string gluon vertex ] ) in the auxiliary forms ( [ def of open - string aux gluon vertex ] ) and to make the loop calculation tractable . at the zero - slope limit \n the gluon vertex operator become @xmath810 , where @xmath811 is a world - line parametrized by the schwinger parameter @xmath812 . \n the auxiliary vertex operator is expected to be @xmath813 in the world - line description . here \n @xmath814 is an auxiliary parameter ( a counterpart of @xmath679 in the field theory ) . \n a simple dimensional analysis shows that @xmath814 is dimensionful and proportional to @xmath815 . \n therefore the zero - slope limit must be taken by fixing the following field theory parameters in the amplitude : @xmath816 simultaneously we also need to fix open - string tensors @xmath200 and @xmath201 . \n we rewrite the amplitude ( [ aux gluon one - loop by open - string parameters ] ) in terms of the above parameters and then pick up the dominant contribution of the @xmath424-expansion . \n these are parallel to what we did in the previous section to obtain the zero - slope limit ( [ open - string ftl of one - loop amplitude ] ) of the tachyon amplitude . by using the relation ( [ ia by hatia ] ) , we find that the following integral turns out to be the zero - slope limit : @xmath817 , \\label{open - string ftl of gluon one - loop amplitude}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath818 take values @xmath819 such that @xmath820 for @xmath262 and @xmath821 for @xmath822 , and the integral is performed over the region ( [ moduli in open - string ftl ] ) . \n if we neglect @xmath823 besides their differentiations the above zero - slope limit reduces to eq.([open - string ftl of one - loop amplitude ] ) , modulo the factor @xmath824 . \n this power has a simple origin in the scaling relations , @xmath825 . \n it was discussed previously that @xmath826 in the integral comes from the schwinger representation of the open - string tachyon propagator , @xmath827 . presently the same term may be interpreted as an ir regularization of the amplitude by an analytic continuation of @xmath828 to a small positive @xmath829 . \n the above zero - slope limit can be identified with the corresponding one - loop amplitude of the non - commutative @xmath479 gauge theory . \n some related calculation in the gauge theory may be found in @xcite@xcite . ) \n may be compared with eq.(4.9 ) of @xcite . \n the integration measure used in that paper is different from ours . \n ] similarly to the scalar field theory , @xmath830 in the above integral is understood as a uv regularization @xcite which depends on the external momentum @xmath460 . in the gauge theory as well , this causes the problem of uv - ir mixing and makes the field theory description at high energy scale difficult .    as explained in section \n [ sec : uv nc scalar ] , the open- and closed - string parameters used in the descriptions of the amplitude are two kinds of coordinates of the moduli space of conformal classes of cylinder with @xmath383 punctures at the boundaries . \n two ends of the moduli space which are located at @xmath25 and @xmath18 play important roles in the zero - slope limits . \n the field theory amplitude ( [ open - string ftl of gluon one - loop amplitude ] ) is obtained by a suitable magnification of the integral ( [ aux gluon one - loop by open - string parameters ] ) on an infinitesimal neighbourhood around @xmath18 . \n we need to focus on the region @xmath442 to know the uv behavior of the gauge theory . \n as is the case of the scalar field theory , a possible resolution is to take a zero - slope limit such that an infinitesimal neighbourhood around @xmath25 is magnified . \n it becomes effective to use the closed - string parameters near this end . \n the zero - slope limit which we examine is essentially the same as that was examined for the open - string tachyons . \n explicitly we take the limit by fixing the following parameters : @xmath831 in the limiting process we fix open - string tensors @xmath200 and @xmath201 as well to capture the world - volume theory . \n the auxiliary parameters in the above are the rescaled ones used in the integral ( [ aux gluon one - loop by closed - string parameters ] ) . \n in contrast with the previous scaling we keep them intact . this is because the present limit is not expected to allow a naive world - line description . as can be observed in the expression ( [ equivalence with boundary state formalism for gluon ] ) these parameters are nothing but the auxiliary parameters used for the description of gluon vertex operators in the boundary state formalism .        as was pointed out in the previous study of the scalar field theory , the zero - slope limit based on the closed - string parameters describes physics at the trans - string scale of the world - volume theory . \n all the perturbative stringy states of open - string contribute to the limit . they bring about a striking contrast between the two limits . we can find the propagator of closed - string tachyon of momentum @xmath460 in the limit ( [ closed - string ftl of one - loop amplitude for gluon ] ) while the counterpart in ( [ open - string ftl of gluon one - loop amplitude ] ) is the curious regularization factor . in that limit there appear terms describing correlations between two gluons inserted at @xmath423 and @xmath462 . \n these correlations are caused by the kinetic energies of the propagating gluons . \n but they are lost in ( [ closed - string ftl of one - loop amplitude for gluon ] ) and gluons become topological in this limit . \n the disappearance originates in the modular transforms ( [ modular trans of tachyon correlations ] ) . \n it was shown in @xcite disk amplitudes of a closed - string tachyon scattering with arbitrary number of gluons turn out to generate a _ straight _ \n open wilson line in seiberg - witten s zero - slope limit . \n the path is a straight line connecting @xmath38 and @xmath843 , where @xmath645 is the momentum of the tachyon . \n the displacement @xmath844 is required by the gauge invariance @xcite . in this section \n we first reproduce the above result by using the boundary states constructed in section [ sec : gluon boundary state ] . \n computations provided below become also helpful for our subsequent investigations of generically curved open wilson lines \n .    closed - string tachyon state with momentum @xmath845 and its bpz dual state are given by @xmath846 disk amplitude of the closed - string tachyon scattering with @xmath260 gluons is obtained in the boundary state formalism by integrating the overlap @xmath847 ; ( \\sigma_{1},k^{(1)}),\\cdots , ( \\sigma_{m},k^{(m ) } )    \\right\\rangle\\right.$ ] on its moduli space . \n to evaluate this overlap , we start by computing the overlap with the auxiliary boundary states . \n this becomes @xmath848;\\{a_r\\ } ;     ( \\sigma_{1},k^{(1)}),\\cdots , ( \\sigma_{m},k^{(m ) } )

closed - string . \n they conjectured a possible correspondence between the perturbative massive states of closed - string and the gauge theory operators obtained as the coefficients in a perturbative expansion of open wilson line ( the harmonic expansion at the straight line ) . in this subsection \n we prove their conjecture . \n we show , in a self - contained fashion , how one can obtain curved open wilson lines and present an explicit correspondence between their fluctuations and the closed - string states . \n let @xmath621 be a loop in the momentum space . \n the harmonic expansion is given by @xmath861 @xmath862 $ ] . \n we first introduce the following _ out_-state of closed - string : @xmath863 one may think of this state as a stringy extension , ( or a generalization to include the massive modes ) , of the closed - string tachyon state . \n the oscillator representation can be read as @xmath864~.         \\label{eq : oscillator expression of momentum loop state}\\ ] ] this

yields the following equalities : @xmath872 where @xmath873 and @xmath874 are integers greater than or equal to zero . \n this implies that the state @xmath871 is a generating function of the closed - string states which are off - shell in general . \n now we wish to compute overlaps of the above state , instead of the tachyon , with the boundary states . since it is a generating function of the

section \n we wish to deliver the other side of the story . \n the following discussions include much speculation and therefore they are incomplete . \n let us first observe that the auxiliary boundary states of gluons are eigenstates of the momentum operator @xmath598 . the boundary state @xmath946;\\{a_{r}\\};(\\sigma_{1},k^{(1 ) } ) , \\bigr . \n $ ] @xmath947 @xmath948 has the eigenvalue equal to @xmath949 @xmath950 @xmath951 . \n therefore this state is proportional to the eigenstate @xmath952 of the corresponding eigenvalues . \n this can be seen by a comparison between oscillator representations ( [ aux m gluon bs ] ) and ( [ eq : pn - state ] ) of the boundary state and the momentum eigenstate . in terms of \n the parametrization ( [ eq : pbn - eigenvalue ] ) the above eigenvalue corresponds to @xmath953 by using these values of @xmath954 and @xmath955 , the precise relation between the two states can be written as follows : @xmath956;\\{a_{r}\\ } ;    (

represented it in terms of open - string tensors . \n let us comment on the multiplicative factors appearing in the above relation . as can be seen from eq.([boundary limit of disk green function ] ) , the second line on the rhs comes from the terms proportional to @xmath327 of disk green s functions at the world - sheet boundary ( the boundary circle ) . as regard the exponential in the first line on the rhs , we might think of it as being related to short distance singularities between the gluons on the boundary circle . \n in fact , by recasting the exponent into the following form , @xmath958 we find a singularity similar to that appearing in the ope between auxiliary gluon vertex operators . \n in the same way , concerning the dual boundary states , we obtain the following

discuss physical meanings of the momentum eigenstates appearing in eqs.([eq : aux state as eigenstate ] ) and ( [ eq : tachyon bs as eigenstate ] ) . \n we henceforth concentrate on gluons . \n it is

given in eq.([eq : boundary action2 ] ) . \n boundary conditions of @xmath71 can be read from variation of @xmath981 $ ] . \n it turns out to be @xmath988 , as expected . \n these observations on the boundary states and the momentum eigenstates seem to indicate a chance to interpret boundary states of open - string legs as momentum eigenstates of closed - string with eigenvalues being delta functions on the boundary circle . \n our expectation is , in fact , beyond this . \n let us recall that the momentum eigenstates are expressed in eqs.([eq : pnb - shift ] ) and ( [ eq : pn - shift ] ) by using operators of the form @xmath989 where @xmath508 are the closed - string coordinate operators and @xmath990 denotes the standard normal - ordering of closed - string . \n if we forget about @xmath508 being quantum operators , we could write down the exponential , without any hesitation , in the path - ordered form along the boundary circle , @xmath991   $ ] . \n since @xmath508 are quantum operators the path - ordered exponential becomes vague without a prescription . \n namely we need to regularize the path - ordered integral . \n relevant regularization in place of the above normal - ordering will be discretization of the boundary circle . \n in such a regularization scheme the eigenvalues @xmath26 are regarded as sums of delta functions on the original boundary circle . \n this leads us to the conjecture : _ momentum eigenstates of closed - string have expansions by means of boundary states with open - string legs _ . \n finally we would like to mention some related issues . as we carried out to a certain extent in this paper , \n our boundary states enable us to perform off - shell calculations . \n this suggests that these states can be used in a covariant formulation of a field theory of interacting open- and closed - strings . \n string field theory that has prediction power for the open - closed mixed systems has been required also in our understanding of unstable @xmath51-branes and tachyon condensations associated with them @xcite . \n it seems probable that boundary states with open - string legs constructed here are generalized to vertex functions between open- and closed - strings in such a field theory . \n we plan to discuss these issues elsewhere . \n t.n . would like to thank members of particle theory group of kek for

        "article": "one of the oldest problems of algebra is the equation solvability problem over a given algebraic structure . nowadays , \n many such classical problems arise in a new perspective , namely to consider their computational complexity . in this paper \n we investigate the complexity of the equation solvability problem over finite groups and rings . \n the _ equation solvability problem _ over a finite group @xmath0 asks whether or not two group expressions ( i.e.  products of variables and elements of @xmath0 ) can attain the same value for some substitution over @xmath0 . \n in other words , for the equation solvability problem , one needs to find if there exists at least one substitution satisfying the equation . \n another interesting problem is whether or not _ all _ substitutions satisfy the equation . \n the _ equivalence problem _ over a finite group @xmath0 asks whether or not two group expressions @xmath1 and @xmath2 are equivalent over @xmath0 ( denoted by @xmath3 ) , that is whether or not @xmath1 and @xmath2 determine the same function over @xmath0 . \n first burris and lawrence @xcite investigated the complexity of the equivalence problem over finite groups . \n they proved that if a group @xmath0 is nilpotent or @xmath4 , the dihedral group for odd @xmath5 , then the equivalence problem for @xmath0 has polynomial time complexity . \n they conjectured that the equivalence problem for @xmath0 is in polynomial time if @xmath0 is solvable , and conp - complete otherwise . \n horvth and szab @xcite confirmed the conjecture for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are abelian groups such that the exponent of @xmath7 is squarefree and @xmath9 . \n later horvth @xcite generalized this result to semidirect products @xmath10 , where @xmath7 and @xmath11 are abelian groups ( here @xmath12 denotes the centralizer of @xmath7 in @xmath13 ) . \n horvth , lawrence , mrai and szab @xcite proved the conp - complete part of the conjecture . \n but the complexity of the equivalence problem over many solvable , not nilpotent groups is not determined , yet . \n three of the smallest groups , for which this complexity is not known , are @xmath14 , @xmath15 and a non - commutative group of order @xmath16 . \n see @xcite for a more comprehensive list . \n even less is known about the equation solvability problem . \n goldmann and russel @xcite proved that if @xmath0 is nilpotent then the equation solvability problem over @xmath0 is solvable in polynomial time , while if @xmath0 is not solvable , then the equation solvability problem is np - complete . \n little is known for solvable , not nilpotent groups . \n horvth proved in ( * ? ? ? \n * corollary 2 ) that the equation solvability problem over @xmath17 is solvable in polynomial time for certain groups @xmath18 , where @xmath19 or @xmath20 or @xmath21 and @xmath13 is commutative . \n note that all results for both the equivalence and the equation solvability problem over solvable , not nilpotent groups are about groups @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is abelian . \n one of the groups of small order , for which the equation solvability problem is unknown , is the group @xmath24 . here , @xmath25 denotes the noncommutative group of @xmath26 upper unitriangular matrices over @xmath27 . \n horvth explicitly asks in ( * ? ? ? \n * problem  4 ) the complexity of the equivalence and equation solvability problems over this group . \n the group @xmath24 is isomorphic to a special subgroup of the @xmath28 upper triangular matrices over @xmath29 . \n motivated by the definition of pattern groups from @xcite , we call a group @xmath22 a _ semipattern _ group , if @xmath23 is a subgroup of the group of upper unitriangular matrices , and @xmath13 is a subgroup of the diagonal matrices . \n we give the precise definition of semipattern groups in section  [ spcs ] . \n the main result of the paper is the following . \n [ fotetel ] the equation solvability problem over semipattern groups is solvable in polynomial time . \n the group @xmath24 defined in ( * ? ? ? * problem  4 ) is in fact a semipattern group , thus theorem  [ fotetel ] answers horvth s question completely . \n further , from theorem  [ fotetel ] the equivalence problem over semipattern groups is solvable in polynomial time , as well . \n indeed , it is known that for a group @xmath17 if the equation solvability problem is solvable in polynomial time , then the equivalence problem is solvable in polynomial time , as well .    in the proof of theorem  [ fotetel ] \n we reduce the solvability of the input equation over a matrix group over a finite field to the solvability of a system of equations over the same field . \n then we apply some results over finite rings . \n therefore , we summarize the known results over rings .    the _ equation solvability problem _ over a finite ring @xmath30 asks whether or not two polynomials can attain the same value for some substitution over @xmath30 . \n the _ equivalence problem _ over a finite ring @xmath30 asks whether or not two polynomials are equivalent over @xmath30 i.e.  if they determine the same function over @xmath30 . \n the complexity of these questions was completely characterized in the past two decades . \n hunt and stearnes @xcite investigated the equivalence problem for finite commutative rings . later burris and lawrence @xcite generalized their result to non - commutative rings . \n they proved that the equivalence problem for @xmath31 is solvable in polynomial time if @xmath31 is nilpotent , and is conp - complete otherwise . \n the proof of burris and lawrence reduces the satisfiability ( sat ) problem to the equivalence problem by using long products of sums of variables . nevertheless , \n if we expand this polynomial into a sum of monomials then the length of the new polynomial may become exponential in the length of the original polynomial . \n such a change in the length suggests that the complexity of the equivalence problem might be different if the input polynomials are restricted to be written as sums of monomials . \n this motivated lawrence and willard @xcite to introduce the _ sigma equivalence _ and _ sigma equation solvability problems _ , where the input polynomials are given as sums of monomials . \n lawrence and willard conjectured that if the factor by the jacobson radical is commutative then the sigma equivalence problem is solvable in polynomial time , and is conp - complete otherwise . \n szab and vrtesi proved the conp - complete part of the conjecture in @xcite . \n horvth confirmed the conjecture for commutative rings in @xcite . \n the polynomial part of this conjecture is completely proved in the manuscript @xcite . \n most of the results for the [ sigma ] equation solvability problem follow from the corresponding result for the [ sigma ] equivalence problem . in particular \n , from the argument of szab and vrtesi follows that if the factor by the jacobson radical is not commutative then the sigma equation solvability problem is np - complete . \n horvth , lawrence and willard @xcite proved that if this factor is commutative then the sigma equation solvability problem is solvable in polynomial time . thus , the sigma equation solvability problem is completely characterized .    for the general equation solvability , arguments of burris and lawrence from @xcite yield that if the ring is not nilpotent then the problem is np - complete . \n horvth in @xcite proved that the equation solvability problem is solvable in polynomial time otherwise . \n [ nr ] if @xmath30 is a finite , nilpotent ring then the equation solvability problem over @xmath30 is solvable in polynomial time . \n horvth uses ramsey s theorem in the proof of theorem  [ nr ] . \n he defines a number @xmath32 that depends only on the ring @xmath31 . \n then he proves that the image of every polynomial can be obtained by substituting @xmath33 into all but @xmath32-many variables . \n thus one can decide whether or not @xmath34 is solvable over @xmath31 in @xmath35 time . however , this number @xmath36 is huge in the size of the ring . \n in fact , @xmath32 is greater than @xmath37 , where the height of the tower in the exponent is the nilpotency class of @xmath31 . \n horvth specifically asks in ( * ? ? \n * problem  3 ) whether or not this number @xmath32 can be decreased .    in the second half of the paper \n we give a new proof of theorem  [ nr ] . \n our algorithm is much more efficient than horvth s . \n wilson @xcite characterizes nilpotent rings with the help of special kind of nilpotent matrix rings . \n we can decide the equation solvability problem over these special matrix rings similarly as we do over semipattern groups in theorem  [ fotetel ] . \n in particular , we show that over a nilpotent ring @xmath31 we can decide in @xmath38 time whether or not @xmath34 is solvable , thus providing a partial answer to problem  3 in @xcite , as well . \n we mention that in a completely independent way , krolyi and szab also found a way to decrease the exponent @xmath32 in @xcite . \n in section  [ bev ] we summarize the notations , definitions and theorems , that we use in the paper . \n in particular , in section  [ spcs ] we review the definition of pattern groups , then we define semipattern groups . in section  [ 2.3 ] we discuss the generalization of the equation solvability problem over rings for systems of equations . \n we are going to apply these results in order to prove theorems  [ fotetel ]  and  [ nr ] . in section  [ nil ] \n we lay the groundwork for the proof of theorem  [ nr ] . in section \n we prove theorem  [ fotetel ] . \n we use ideas of this proof in section  [ 3 . ] , where we prove theorem  [ nr ] . \n let @xmath39 denote the finite field of @xmath40 elements . \n let us consider the group @xmath41 of @xmath42 upper triangular matrices , that is those matrices whose elements under the diagonal are zero and the elements in the diagonal are non - zero :    @xmath43 here the group operation is the matrix multiplication . \n let the @xmath42 identity matrix denoted by @xmath44 . \n let @xmath45 denote the @xmath42 matrix whose elements are all zero except for the @xmath46 element in the @xmath47 row , which is 1 . \n let @xmath48 . \n let @xmath49 thus , @xmath50 contains all those upper triangular matrices , where every element in the diagonal is @xmath51 , and every element whose position is not occurring in p has to be @xmath52 . \n if @xmath50 is a subgroup of @xmath41 , then we call @xmath50 a _ pattern _ group . for more details on pattern groups , \n see e.g.  @xcite . \n let @xmath53 be subgroups of @xmath54 and let @xmath55 be the set of @xmath42 matrices over @xmath39 whose @xmath47 element in the diagonal is from @xmath56 @xmath57 : @xmath58    if @xmath50 is a pattern group then @xmath59 is a subgroup of @xmath41 . \n then we call @xmath59 a _ semipattern group _ and we denote such a group by @xmath60 . \n further , we note that @xmath61 and @xmath62 . \n the group @xmath24 defined in ( * ? ? ? \n * problem  4 ) is in fact a semipattern group : @xmath63      let @xmath64 be a commutative , unital ring , @xmath65 @xmath66 be subsets of @xmath64 . \n for nonnegative integers @xmath67 , let @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 be pairwise disjoint sets of variables . \n we say that _ @xmath72 is solvable over @xmath64 for substitutions from @xmath73 _ ( and write @xmath74 @xmath75 is solvable over @xmath31 ) \n if there exist @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 such that the two polynomials attain the same value on this substitution : @xmath80 for proving theorem  [ fotetel ] , we will directly apply the following result of horvth @xcite . \n [ egyrszmo ] let @xmath39 be a finite field . \n let @xmath81 be subgroups of @xmath54 . \n let @xmath82 $ ] be a polynomial , written as a sum of monomials \n . then it can be decided whether the system of equations @xmath83 is solvable over @xmath39 in @xmath84 time .    to prove theorem \n [ nr ] we are going to use the following from @xcite . \n [ er ] let @xmath85 $ ] be polynomials , written as sums of monomials . \n then it can be decided whether the system of equations @xmath86 is solvable over @xmath87 in @xmath88 time . \n the complexity of the equation solvability problem over finite nilpotent rings is known . \n horvth @xcite proved that the equation solvability problem is solvable in polynomial time . \n we give a new algorithm in section  [ 3 . ] \n that is much more efficient than horvth s . in this part \n we show that we can characterize the complexity of the equation solvability problem over nilpotent rings using the sigma equation solvability problem over special kind of nilpotent matrix rings . \n hence we can apply the same ideas that we used in the proof of theorem  [ fotetel ] . \n horvth proved theorem  [ nr ] using ramsey s theory . \n he defined a number @xmath32 that depends only on the ring @xmath31 . \n then he proved that the image of every polynomial can be obtained by substituting @xmath52 into all but @xmath32-many variables . \n thus one can decide whether or not @xmath34 is solvable over @xmath31 in @xmath89 time . \n but the number @xmath36 is huge in the size of the ring . \n let @xmath90 be the characteristic of @xmath31 and @xmath91 be the nilpotency class of @xmath31 . \n let furthermore @xmath92 . then @xmath32 is greater than @xmath93 , where the height of the tower in the exponent is @xmath91 . \n we give a new proof of theorem  [ nr ] in section  [ 3 . ] . \n our algorithm is much more efficient than horvth s . \n we prove that @xmath94 time is enough . \n first , we show that we can handle the equation solvability problem over nilpotent rings using the sigma equation solvability problem over special kind of nilpotent matrix rings . \n if @xmath31 is a nilpotent ring then the complexity of the _ general _ equation solvability problem over @xmath31 is the same as the complexity of the _ sigma _ equation solvability over @xmath31 . \n indeed , we can rewrite every polynomial @xmath95 over @xmath31 as a sum of monomials in @xmath96 time , where @xmath91 is the nilpotency class of @xmath31 . \n now , @xmath97 . \n hence , at the cost of an extra @xmath98 factor in the exponent , we may assume that every input polynomial is given as a sum of monomials . \n furthermore it is enough to consider the equation solvability problem over nilpotent rings with prime power characteristic , because every ring is a direct sum of rings of prime power characteristic , and the equation solvability problem can be handled componentwise . \n wilson @xcite characterizes finite nilpotent rings with prime power characteristic . \n [ wil ] let @xmath31 be a finite nilpotent ring with characteristic @xmath99 , and let @xmath31 have an independent generating set consisting of @xmath100 generators over @xmath101 . \n then @xmath31 is a homomorphic image of a ring @xmath102 of matrices over @xmath101 where every entry on or below the main diagonal is a multiple of @xmath103 . \n in fact for nilpotent rings it is enough to consider the equation solvability problem over such a matrix ring @xmath104 , since if the equation solvability problem is solvable in polynomial time for @xmath104 , then it is solvable in polynomial time for a factor @xmath105 , as well . \n indeed , let @xmath106 be a polynomial over @xmath107 and @xmath95 be any polynomial over @xmath104 whose factor by @xmath108 is @xmath106 \n . then @xmath109 is solvable over @xmath107 if and only if @xmath110 is solvable over @xmath104 for some @xmath111 . \n this gives an extra @xmath112 factor to the running time . \n however , @xmath113 , and we have @xmath114 , @xmath115 . \n thus , @xmath116 , which only depends on @xmath31 , and thus can be forgotten about . \n thus it is enough to consider the sigma equation solvability problem over such a matrix ring of matrices over @xmath87 where every entry on or below the main diagonal of each matrix is a multiple of @xmath103 . \n we can handle such matrix rings similarly as we do with the semmipattern groups . \n hence we can use ideas of the proof described in section  [ 2 . ] . \n we give a new , efficient algorithm that decides the equation solvability problem over nilpotent matrix rings in section  [ 3 . ] . \n in this section we consider the equation solvability problem over semmipattern groups . \n first we characterize the multiplication of matrices from @xmath41 in lemma  [ mxszor ] . \n we use this formula in our algorithm . \n [ mxszor ] let n be a natural number . for every @xmath117 let @xmath118 let @xmath119 then    * for every @xmath120 we have @xmath121 * for every @xmath122 we have + @xmath123    the length of is @xmath124 , and in particular is polynomial in @xmath125 . \n the lemma can be proved by induction on @xmath125 . \n however , instead of giving the technical induction proof , we explain how one can arrive at this formula . \n let us consider the @xmath46 element of the @xmath47 row @xmath126 of the matrix @xmath127 @xmath128 . \n we can express this element @xmath126 with a sum of some appropriate products . in every such product \n we multiply one element from each matrix @xmath129 @xmath130 . \n ( in the notation the index @xmath131 appears as the last index . ) \n furthermore the index of the column of a term must equal with the index of the row of the following term in every such product . \n ( therefore a term of the form @xmath132 or @xmath133 follows the term of the form @xmath132 or @xmath134 . ) \n the row index of the first term is @xmath135 , the column index of the last term is @xmath136 . the matrices @xmath137 are upper triangular matrices , hence the row index of every term of every product is less than or equal to the column index . \n ( thus for every term of the form @xmath133 , that are above the diagonal , we have @xmath138 . ) \n thus the @xmath46 element of the @xmath47 row @xmath126 of the matrix @xmath139 is a sum of products of @xmath125 terms such that    * the row index of the first term is @xmath135 , the column index of the last term is @xmath136 ; * the column index of every term equals to the row index of the next term ; * the row index of a term is at most the row index of the next term . \n notice , that every @xmath125-term product is uniquely determined by those terms where the row index differs from the column index . \n let two such consecutive terms of the product be @xmath140 and @xmath141 . \n ( here @xmath142 and @xmath143 . ) the product of the terms between these two terms have row and column index @xmath144 and their last index is more than @xmath145 and less than @xmath146 . \n thus between the terms @xmath140 and @xmath141 can only be the product @xmath147 . \n thus formula   is proved . \n now , we calculate the length of formula  . \n formula   is a sum of products . \n the length of every product is @xmath125 , thus we need to calculate the number of products . \n notice , that every product is uniquely determined by the column indices of the terms . more exactly we need to know the column indices of the first @xmath148 terms , because the column index of the last term is @xmath136 . \n we can choose these indices from the set @xmath149 . \n the order of the selected elements does not matter . we only need to determine how many indices are equal to @xmath135 or to @xmath150 , etc , or to @xmath151 . \n thus we need to choose @xmath148 element from a set of @xmath152 elements such that repetitions are allowed . \n hence the number of products is @xmath153 since every product has length @xmath125 , the length of @xmath126 is @xmath154 thus the length of @xmath126 is at most @xmath155 for every index @xmath156 . \n let @xmath60 be a semipattern group . \n let @xmath157 be a polynomial over @xmath60 . thus @xmath158 can indicate a constant or a variable over @xmath60 @xmath159 . \n of course @xmath158 and @xmath160 can indicate the same constant or variable . \n let    @xmath161    if @xmath162 indicates constant then @xmath163 is a constant in @xmath164 and @xmath165 is a constant in @xmath39 @xmath166 . \n if @xmath162 is a variable , then @xmath163 is a variable , that we can substitute from @xmath56 , and @xmath165 is a variable that we can substitute from @xmath39 . \n furthermore @xmath167 if and only if @xmath168 ( for every @xmath169 ) and @xmath170 for every @xmath122 . \n we can rewrite the polynomial @xmath171 with this notation as @xmath172    after multiplying these matrices using lemma  [ mxszor ] we obtain    @xmath173 where @xmath174    the polynomial @xmath171 can attain the unit matrix for a substitution if and only if @xmath175 attains @xmath51 ( @xmath176 ) and @xmath177 attains @xmath52 for the same substitution ( @xmath122 ) . \n thus @xmath178 is solvable over @xmath60 if and only if the system of equations @xmath179 is solvable over @xmath39 . \n this is a system of equations over @xmath39 where the polynomials are given as sums of monomials . \n hence we can decide the solvability of this system of equations in polynomial time by theorem  [ egyrszmo ] . \n the rewriting of @xmath171 over @xmath60 into the system of equations @xmath180 over @xmath39 can be done in @xmath124 time by lemma  [ mxszor ] , and the length of each equation is @xmath181 . \n the number of equations is @xmath182 , which does not depend on @xmath125 , only on the group @xmath60 . by theorem  [ egyrszmo ] \n one can decide whether this system has a solution in @xmath183 time . \n let @xmath104 be a ring of @xmath184 matrices over @xmath87 where every entry on or below the main diagonal of each matrix in @xmath104 is a multiple of @xmath103 . \n let @xmath171 be a polynomial over @xmath104 given as a sum of monomials . \n let @xmath185 denote a monomial in the sum . \n let @xmath186 if @xmath187 indicates constant then @xmath188 are constants in @xmath87 . \n if @xmath187 is a variable , then @xmath188 are variables , that we can substitute from @xmath87 . furthermore , @xmath167 if and only if @xmath189 and @xmath190 for every @xmath191 . \n first @xmath195 is a polynomial given as a sum of monomials over @xmath101 . in every such monomial we multiply one term from each matrix @xmath158 @xmath196 . hence the length of every monomial is @xmath125 . \n there are at most @xmath197 monomials in every polynomial @xmath195 according to the usual multiplication of matrices . \n however , every nonzero monomial contains at most @xmath198 terms from on or below the main diagonal , since the characteristic of @xmath101 is @xmath99 . \n therefore every nonzero monomial is of the form @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 . \n notice that @xmath202 holds as well . \n indeed , every term @xmath203 is from above the main diagonal , hence @xmath204 \n . therefore @xmath205 and thus @xmath206 . \n similarly @xmath207 . \n hence the length of every nonzero monomial is at most @xmath208 . in particular , if @xmath209 then every monomial in @xmath195 equals @xmath52 . \n therefore there are at most @xmath210 monomials in every polynomial @xmath195 and thus @xmath211 . \n the input polynomial @xmath171 is a sum of at most @xmath212 monomials @xmath213 . \n let @xmath214 then @xmath215 is the sum of at most @xmath212-many polynomials @xmath195 for every @xmath216 . \n thus @xmath217 , as @xmath218 and @xmath100 depend only on the ring @xmath31 . \n the polynomial @xmath171 can attain the zero matrix for a substitution if and only if @xmath215 attains zero for the same substitution for every @xmath219 . \n thus @xmath220 is solvable over @xmath104 if and only if the system of equations @xmath221 is solvable over @xmath101 . \n this is a system of equations over @xmath222 where the polynomials are given as sums of monomials . \n hence we can decide the solvability of this system of equations in polynomial time by theorem  [ er ] . \n the rewriting of @xmath171 over @xmath104 into the system of equations @xmath223 can be done in @xmath224 time , and @xmath225 . \n the number of equations is @xmath226 , which does not depend on @xmath212 , only on the ring @xmath104 . by theorem  [ er ] \n one can decide whether this system has a solution in @xmath227 time . \n finally , we explain how this result can be applied to determine if an equation @xmath34 is solvable over an _ \n arbitrary _ nilpotent ring @xmath31 of characteristic @xmath228 . \n let @xmath104 be the matrix ring as in theorem  [ wil ] , and let @xmath229 . \n further , let @xmath171 denote the polynomial in @xmath104 corresponding to @xmath95 . notice , that @xmath230 was the characteristic of @xmath31 in theorem  [ wil ] , hence @xmath231 . \n furthermore @xmath232 and @xmath233 . \n therefore @xmath234 . \n hence , one can decide if @xmath235 is solvable over @xmath236 in @xmath237 time . \n thus , one can decide if the equation @xmath34 is solvable over @xmath31 in @xmath238 time . \n now , @xmath239 , which only depends on @xmath31 . therefore , if @xmath95 is given as a _ sum of monomials _ \n , then @xmath240 , and one can decide @xmath241 over an arbitrary nilpotent ring @xmath31 in @xmath242 time , as well . if , however , @xmath95 is an arbitrary polynomial over @xmath31 , then after rewriting it as a sum of monomials we have @xmath243 , giving an extra @xmath244 factor in the exponent . \n thus , one can decide @xmath241 over an arbitrary nilpotent ring @xmath31 in @xmath245 time . \n mikael goldmann

        "abstract":"The paper addresses the computational complexity of the equation solvability problem over various algebraic structures, particularly finite groups and rings. It introduces a new polynomial-time algorithm for solving equations over certain semidirect products, including non-abelian groups, by representing them as matrix groups and reducing the problem to solvability over fields. This method also significantly improves the efficiency of solving equations over nilpotent rings, providing advancements over previous approaches. The results bridge gaps in understanding solvability for complex algebraic systems and offer practical computational technique."

        "article": "gliese 229b is not only the first brown dwarf recognized as genuine @xcite , but it is also the brightest and best - studied t dwarf known . with an effective temperature of @xmath5k , it lies squarely between the latest l dwarfs ( @xmath6k , @xcite ) and the giant planets of the solar system ( @xmath7k ) . \n indeed , its near infrared spectrum shows the strong h@xmath8o absorption bands characteristic of very - low mass stars and the strong ch@xmath9 bands seen in the spectra of jupiter , saturn and titan . \n the transitional nature of the spectrum of gl 229b is remarkable and hints at the spectral appearance of extrasolar giant planets which have effective temperatures in the range 200 \n 1600@xmath10k @xcite . \n a wealth of data on gl 229b has accumulated since its discovery five years ago . \n broad band photometry from @xmath11 through @xmath12 and an accurate parallax @xcite allow an accurate determination of its bolometric luminosity . \n spectroscopic observations @xcite covering the range from 0.8 to 5.0@xmath13 m have revealed a very rapidly declining flux shortward of 1@xmath13 m , the unmistakable presence of ch@xmath9 , h@xmath8o , and cs , and demonstrated the _ absence _ of the crh , feh , vo and tio features characteristic of late m and early l dwarfs . \n finally , noll , geballe & marley ( 1997 ) and @xcite have detected co with an abundance well above the value predicted by chemical equilibrium , a phenomenon also seen in the atmosphere of jupiter . \n model spectra for gl 229b @xcite reproduce the overall energy distribution fairly well and all agree that 1 ) @xmath5k , 2 ) compared to gaseous molecular opacity , the dust opacity is small if not negligible in the infrared , 3 ) the gravity of gl 229b is poorly constrained at present . \n the rapid decline of the flux at wavelengths shortward of 1@xmath13 m is interpreted as caused by an absorbing haze of complex hydrocarbons ( griffith , yelle & marley 1998 ) or alternatively by the pressure - broadened red wing of the k i resonance doublet at 0.77@xmath13 m ( tsuji , ohnaka & aoki 1999 ; burrows , marley & sharp 1999 ) .    in this paper , we present new high - resolution spectra in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands . with the inclusion of the `` red '' spectrum of @xcite , we analyze each part of the spectrum separately to obtain independent measures of the h@xmath8o abundance of gl 229b  broadly interpreted as the metallicity index  to detect for the first time the presence of nh@xmath3 in its spectrum , and to estimate the nh@xmath3 abundance at two different depths in the atmosphere . \n our results are expressed in terms of the surface gravity which can not be determined from the data presented here . \n nevertheless , we identify a reduced set of acceptable combinations of @xmath14 and gravity , using the observed bolometric luminosity of gl 229b @xcite . \n the observations and the near infrared spectra are presented in  2 . \n section 3 shows how an accurate parallax , a well - sampled spectral energy distribution and evolutionary models greatly reduce the possible range of combinations of @xmath14 and gravity without having to resort to spectrum fitting . the synthetic spectrum calculation and our method of analysis \n are described in  4 . \n the results concerning several molecules of interest which are at least potentially detectable are presented in  5 , followed by a discussion in  6 . \n finally , a summary of the results and directions for future study are given in  7 . \n spectra of gl  229b in selected narrow intervals in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 windows were obtained at the 3.8  m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) in 1998 january , using the facility spectrometer cgs4 @xcite and its 150 l / mm grating . details of the observations are provided in table 1 . \n these are among the highest resolution spectra obtained of any t dwarf . \n the spectra were obtained in the standard stare / nod mode with the @xmath15 wide slit of the spectrometer oriented at a position angle of @xmath16 , nearly perpendicular to the line connecting gl 229a and gl 229b . \n the southward - going diffraction spike of gl 229a together with scattered light from that star , which is 10 magnitudes brighter than gl 229b , contaminated the array rows near and to the southwest of those containing the spectrum of gl 229b . \n the contamination on the gl 229b rows was determined by interpolation and was subtracted ; typically it was comparable or somewhat smaller than the signal from gl  229b . in order to remove telluric absorption features , spectra of the a0v star bs  1849 were measured just prior to gl  229b . in all cases the match in airmasses was better than five percent and hence in the ratioed spectra residual telluric features are small compared to the noise level . \n wavelength calibration was achieved by observations of arc lamps and is in all cases better than one part in @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) . \n the spectra shown in this paper have been slightly smoothed , so that the resolving powers are lower than those in table 1 by approximately 25 percent . \n they also have been rebinned to facilitate coadding like spectra and joining adjacent spectral regions . \n the error bars can be judged by the point - to - point variations in featureless portions of the spectra , the signal - to - noise ratios at the continuum peaks are approximately 40 in the @xmath2 band , 25 in the @xmath1 band , and 30 in the @xmath0 band . \n the flux calibration of each spectrum is approximate as no attempt was made to match the photometry of gl 229b . \n while we identify the spectra by their corresponding standard photometric infrared bandpass , their wavelength coverages are much narrower than the @xmath19 filters and typically corresponds to the peak flux of gl 229b in each bandpass .    in the @xmath0 band spectrum ( fig . \n 1 ) , nearly all features are caused by h@xmath8o . \n the short wavelength end of the spectrum shows the red side of a ch@xmath9 band , which is responsible for the features seen shortward of @xmath20 m . \n two lines of neutral potassium are easily detected near @xmath21 m . \n no other lines of alkali metals fall within the wavelength coverage of our observations . \n the @xmath1 band spectrum ( fig . \n 2 ) is relatively rich in molecular opacity sources . \n all the features seen in the spectrum are either due to h@xmath8o ( @xmath22 m ) or part of a very strong ch@xmath9 absorption band ( @xmath23 m ) \n . features seen between 1.59 and 1.6@xmath13 m can not presently be ascribed with certainty and are due to either h@xmath8o or ch@xmath9 . while the opacities of nh@xmath3 and h@xmath8s are not negligible in this part of the spectrum , neither molecule forms distinctive spectral features . \n their presence can not be directly ascertained from these data , mainly because their opacity is weaker than that of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 and because of significant pressure broadening ( see  5.3 ) . \n the @xmath2 band flux emerges in an opacity window between a strong h@xmath8o band and a strong ch@xmath9 band ( fig . \n spectral features are caused by h@xmath8o at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath24 m ) and by ch@xmath9 at longer wavelengths ( @xmath25 m ) . \n several distinctive features of nh@xmath3 are expected at the blue end of this spectrum and models predict a single absorption feature of h@xmath8s at @xmath26 m . \n all features seen in figures 1  3 are unresolved blends of numerous molecular transitions . \n a spectral resolution at least 10 times higher would be required to resolve the intrinsic structure of the spectrum of gl 229b . \n while synthetic spectra have been fairly successful at reproducing the unusual spectrum of gl 229b @xcite , the entire spectral energy distribution has not yet been modeled satisfactorily . \n limitations in the opacity databases are partly responsible for the remaining discrepancies between synthetic spectra and the data ( see  4.2 ) . \n these shortcomings have impeded the determination of @xmath14 and of the gravity @xmath27 in particular . \n on the other hand , the bolometric luminosity of gl 229b is now well determined . combining spectroscopic and photometric data from 0.82 to 10@xmath13 m with the parallax \n , @xcite found @xmath28 . with new @xmath29 photometry \n , @xcite found @xmath30 . \n a recalibration using the hst photometry of @xcite gives @xmath31 . \n evolutionary models @xcite allow us to find a family of @xmath32 models with a given @xmath33 . \n figure 4 shows the cooling tracks of solar metallicity brown dwarfs in terms of the surface parameters @xmath14 and @xmath27 . \n models with the bolometric luminosity of gl 229b fall within the band running through the center of the figure . using a very conservative lower limit for the age of gl 229a of 0.2@xmath10gyr @xcite \n , we find @xmath34k . on the other hand , the gravity remains poorly determined with @xmath35 , corresponding to a mass range of 0.015  0.07@xmath36 . while the upper range is very close to the lower main sequence mass limit , \n gl 229b s status as a brown dwarf is secure \n . a star at the edge of the main sequence would be much hotter with @xmath37k ; well outside of fig . \n 4 .    in the remainder of this paper , \n the discussion focuses on three atmosphere models which span the range of allowed solutions ( table 2 and fig . \n 4 ) : @xmath38 ( 870 , 4.5 ) , ( 940 , 5.0 ) and ( 1030 , 5.5 ) , which we label models a , b , and c , respectively . these constraints on @xmath14 and @xmath27 from cooling sequences are quite firm . \n we find the same result , within the error bar on @xmath33 , from several cooling sequences which predate @xcite . \n the latter were computed with different input physics such as the equation of state and surface boundary conditions derived from grey and non - grey atmosphere models using several opacity tabulations .    in section 5 , we show that these three models can fit the spectra only if they have different metallicities , ranging from [ m / h]@xmath39 to @xmath40 . the evolution of brown dwarfs is sensitive to the metallicity through the atmospheric opacity which controls the rate of cooling . we find that for the range of interest here , the effect of a reduced metallicity on our determination of @xmath14 , @xmath27 , and the cooling age is smaller but comparable to that of the uncertainty on the value of @xmath33 . we choose to ignore it for simplicity . \n our analysis is based on the atmosphere models of brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets described in @xcite . briefly \n , the atmospheres are in radiative / convective equilibrium and the equation of radiative transfer is solved with the k - coefficient method . \n the chemical equilibrium is treated as in @xcite . \n gas phase opacities include rayleigh scattering , the collision - induced opacity of h@xmath8 and the molecular opacities of h@xmath8o , ch@xmath9 , nh@xmath3 , h@xmath8s , ph@xmath3 , and co , as well as the continuum opacities of h@xmath41 and h@xmath42 . the molecular line opacity database is described in more detail in  4.2 . \n atomic line opacity is not included . \n because of the relatively large gravity of gl 229b , pressure broadening of the molecular lines plays an important role in determining the @xmath43 profile of the atmosphere and in shaping the spectrum . \n the line - by - line broadening theory we use is described in @xcite . \n the strong continuum opacity source responsible for the rapid decrease of the flux of gl 229b shortward of 1.1@xmath13 m is included following the haze model of @xcite . \n details of the haze model and of our fitting procedure are given in  5.1 . \n the @xmath43 structures of these atmosphere models are shown in fig . \n the profiles intersect each other because both @xmath14 and the gravity vary between the models . \n the inflexion point at @xmath44 signals the top of the convection zone .    using the same monochromatic opacities used to compute the k - coefficients , \n high - resolution synthetic spectra are generated from the atmospheric structures by solving the radiative transfer equation with the feautrier method on a frequency grid with @xmath45@xmath46 . \n spectra with resolution lower than @xmath47@xmath46 can then be generated for comparison with data . \n an unusual aspect of t dwarf atmospheres is the great variation of the opacity with wavelength . \n these atmospheres are strongly non - grey and the near infrared spectrum is sculpted by strong absorption bands of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 . most of the flux emerges in a small number of relatively transparent opacity windows . \n the concept of photosphere becomes rather useless since the level at which the spectrum is formed depends strongly on the wavelength . \n figure 6 shows the depth of the `` photosphere '' @xmath48 in both temperature and pressure as a function of wavelength for model b ( @xmath49k , @xmath50 ) . in the @xmath51 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 bands , and , to a lesser extent , in the @xmath2 and @xmath52 bands , \n the atmosphere is very transparent and can be probed to great depths . for @xmath53 \n m , the spectral energy distribution approaches a planck function with @xmath54k . \n figure 6 reveals that spectroscopy between 0.8 and 12@xmath13 m can probe the atmosphere from @xmath54k down to a depth where @xmath55k , corresponding to a range of 6 pressure scale heights ! this provides an exceptional opportunity to study the physics of the atmosphere of a brown dwarf over an extended vertical range . \n the top of the convection zone for model b ( located at @xmath56k ) is below the `` photosphere '' at all wavelengths and is not directly observable , however .      given the range of acceptable values of @xmath14 and @xmath27 (  3 ) , we can determine the metallicity of gl 229b and the abundance of several key molecules by fitting synthetic spectra to the observations , for each of the three models . \n the precision of our results is determined by the reliability of the models , the noise level in the data and , most significantly , by the limitations of the molecular line lists used to compute their opacities . \n the latter point requires a detailed discussion . \n the opacities of ch@xmath9 and nh@xmath3 are computed from line lists obtained by combining the hitran @xcite and geisa @xcite databases , which are complemented with recent laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations . \n further details are provided in @xcite . \n the resulting line lists for these two molecules are very nearly complete for @xmath57k , and their degree of completeness decreases rapidly at higher temperatures where absorption from excited level become important . \n furthermore , the line list of ch@xmath9 is limited to @xmath58 m . \n we extend the ch@xmath9 opacity to shorter wavelengths with the laboratory measurements of @xcite which provide the absorption coefficient averaged over intervals of 5@xmath10@xmath46 between 1 and 5@xmath13 m at @xmath59k . \n we use @xcite opacities for @xmath60 m and the line list for @xmath61 m . \n this puts the transition from one tabulation to the other in a strong h@xmath8o absorption band and obliterates any discontinuity in ch@xmath9 opacity at the transition . for @xmath62 \n m , the tabulation of @xcite gives the absorption coefficient of ch@xmath9 determined from spectroscopic observations of the giant planets at 0.0004@xmath13 m intervals . because of the low temperatures found in the atmospheres of giant planets , the karkoschka ch@xmath9 opacities are appropriate for @xmath63k . to our knowledge \n , this compilation of nh@xmath3 and ch@xmath9 opacity is the most complete presently available .    as can be seen in figure 6 , \n the temperature in the atmosphere of gl 229b is everywhere greater than 300@xmath10k . \n for ch@xmath9 , we compute temperature - dependent line opacity ( which is incomplete above 300@xmath10k ) from the population of excited levels determined by the boltzmann formula for @xmath61 m , and use temperature independent opacity at shorter wavelengths . while the synthetic spectra computed reproduce the fundamental band of ch@xmath9 very well ( centered at @xmath64 m ) , the match with the 1.6 and 2.3@xmath13 m bands is rather poor . even though ch@xmath9 is a very prominent molecule in the spectrum of gl 229b , \n the current knowledge of its opacity is not adequate for a quantitative analysis of its spectral signature . \n for this reason , we have essentially ignored the regions in our spectra where ch@xmath9 is prominent . unfortunately \n , this prevents us from estimating the abundance of ch@xmath9  and therefore of carbon  in gl 229b . \n ammonia shows significant absorption in both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band spectra . \n the line list for nh@xmath3 starts at @xmath65 m . because the line list does not include transitions from highly excited levels which occur at @xmath66k , the nh@xmath3 opacity we compute at a given wavelength is strictly a lower limit to the actual opacity . \n except for the collision - induced absorption by h@xmath8 , the most important molecular absorber in gl 229b is h@xmath8o , for which the opacity is now relatively well understood . \n we use the most recent and most extensive ab initio line list ( @xcite , @xmath67 transitions ) . \n this line list is essentially complete for @xmath68k . as a demonstration of the equality of this database , we find that the h@xmath8o features computed with this line list correspond extremely well in frequency with the observed features of gl 229b ( _ e.g. _ figs . 7 to 9 ) . \n however , we find noticeable discrepancies in the relative strengths of h@xmath8o features which we attribute to the calculated oscillator strength of the transitions (  5.1 ) . \n this effect can also be seen in fig . \n 1c of @xcite . at high resolution , \n the distribution of molecular transitions in frequency and strength is nearly random , and the inaccuracies in oscillator strengths we have found limit the accuracy of model fitting in a fashion similar to noise . \n this `` opacity noise '' is at least as significant as the noise intrinsic to our data . \n we have constructed a grid of synthetic spectra for the three models shown in fig . \n 4 with metallicity @xmath69 } \\le 0.1 $ ] in steps of 0.1 . \n we use these modeled spectra to fit four distinct spectral regions ( the `` red '' , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 spectra ) separately to determine the metallicity as a function of gravity with an internal precision of @xmath70 dex . for the purpose of fitting the data , \n the synthetic spectra were renormalized to the observed flux at a selected wavelength in each spectral region . \n the model spectra show some distortions in the overall shape of the spectrum which are probably due to remaining uncertainties in the @xmath71 profile of the atmosphere , the inadequate ch@xmath9 opacities , and possible effects of dust opacity . \n considering the additional problems with the strength of the h@xmath8o features , we elected to do all fits `` by eye , '' except where otherwise noted . \n we discuss the fitting of each spectral interval below . in the interest of brevity , we present a detailed discussion of fits obtained only with the model of intermediate gravity ( model b ) . \n the best fits obtained with models a and c are very nearly identical to those with model b. the results are summarized in table 2 . \n the `` red '' spectrum extends from 0.83 to @xmath72 m and is formed deep in the atmosphere where @xmath73k . \n the spectra of @xcite and @xcite reveal two lines of cs i ( at 0.852 and 0.894@xmath13 m ) and a strong h@xmath8o band but _ not _ the bands of tio and vo common to late m dwarfs and early l dwarfs ( fig . 7 ) . \n refractory elements , such as ti , fe , v , ca , and cr , are expected to be bound in condensed compounds in a low - temperature atmosphere such as that of gl 229b and therefore are not available to form molecular bands @xcite . with the exception of the strong , unidentified feature at 0.9874@xmath13 m , all features between 0.89 and 1.0@xmath13 \n m can be attributed to h@xmath8o . \n an overlap of a weak band of h@xmath8o and a weaker ch@xmath9 band causes the small depression at 0.894@xmath13 m which was tentatively tentatively attributed to ch@xmath9 by @xcite and @xcite . \n features below 0.89@xmath13 m can not be identified at present . \n the two cs i lines are not included in our model . \n the flux from gl 229b is also observed to decrease very rapidly toward shorter wavelengths @xcite , which , in the absence of the strong tio and vo bands , is evidently caused by the presence of a missing source of opacity in the atmosphere . \n spectra computed with molecular opacities only ( but excluding tio , vo , feh , etc ) predict visible fluxes which are grossly overestimated @xcite but the detailed sequence of absorption features of the spectrum are well reproduced , indicating that the short wavelength flux is suppressed by a _ \n opacity source . \n we fit the red spectrum of gl 229b between 0.82 and 1.15@xmath13 m to obtain the metallicity . \n we have recalibrated the published spectrum @xcite using the hst photometry of @xcite . \n we model the continuum opacity with a layer of condensates following the approach of @xcite . \n condensates are expected in the atmosphere of gl 229b on the basis of chemical equilibrium calculations @xcite and can provide the required opacity . alternatively , tsuji , ohnaka & aoki ( 1999 ) and burrows , marley , & sharp ( 1999 ) attribute this rapid decline to the pressure broadened red wing of the 0.77@xmath13 m k i resonance doublet . \n the first optical spectrum of a t dwarf ( sdss 1624 + 0029 ) shows that the latter explanation is correct @xcite . the nature of this opacity source is not very important for the determination of the metallicity , however , as long as the proper continuum opacity background is present in the calculation . \n the dust opacity is computed with the mie theory of scattering by spherical particles and is determined by the vertical distribution of the particles , their grain size distribution , and the complex index of refraction of the condensate . \n the cloud model of @xcite is described by 1 ) the vertical density profile of the condensate , taken as : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number density of condensed particles , @xmath76 is the ambient gas pressure , and the cloud layer is bound by @xmath77 2 ) the size distribution of the particles @xmath78 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the diameter of the particles ; and 3 ) the complex index of refraction of the condensate @xmath80 the parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , the function @xmath85 , and the metallicity of the atmosphere are free parameters . \n such a multi - parameter fit of the observed spectrum is not unique . \n furthermore , arbitrarily good fits of the `` continuum '' flux level can be obtained by adjusting the imaginary part of the index of refraction since its wavelength dependence is weakly constrained _ a priori_. our results for the three models are qualitatively similar to those of @xcite . \n typical values of the fitted dust parameters are @xmath86@xmath87bar@xmath88 , @xmath89bar , @xmath90 m , and @xmath91 , with the imaginary part of the index of refraction decreasing from @xmath92 at 0.8@xmath13 m to 0.01 at 1.10@xmath13 m . \n these parameters applied to model b with a metallicity of [ m / h]=@xmath93 result in the fit shown in figure 7 . \n the metallicity of the atmosphere [ m / h ] is largely independent of the dust parameters , however , as it is constrained by the amplitude of the features in the h@xmath8o band which we fit between 0.925 and 0.98@xmath13 m . a larger metallicity results in a larger amplitude of the features inside the band . \n we obtain the same value of [ m / h ] as long as a good fit of the `` continuum '' flux level is obtained , regardless of the particular values of dust parameters . \n the lower panel of fig . \n 7 clearly shows differences in the relative strengths of the absorption features in the h@xmath8o band between the synthetic and observed spectra . \n similar differences also occur in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands . \n the same differences are found for all three atmospheric profiles and point to inaccuracies in the oscillator strength of the ab initio line list of h@xmath8o @xcite . \n the metallicity is fitted to give the best overall fit of these features with a precision of @xmath70 dex . \n strictly speaking , this procedure gives the h@xmath8o abundance , or [ o / h ] rather than [ m / h ] . \n for solar metallicity , the condensation of silicates deep in the atmosphere of gl 229b will reduce the amount of oxygen available to form h@xmath8o by @xmath94% @xcite which implies that @xmath95 } = { \\rm [ o / h ] } + 0.07.\\ ] ] the correction , which decreases for subsolar metallicities , is smaller than our fitting uncertainty and will be ignored hereafter . \n the @xmath0 band spectrum probes the most transparent window of the spectrum of gl 229b and is formed at great depth where @xmath96k and @xmath97bar ( fig . 6 ) . \n our spectrum contains almost exclusively h@xmath8o features , with the exception of ch@xmath9 absorption for @xmath98 m and of two prominent k i lines ( fig . \n since we have elected to ignore ch@xmath9 bands and our synthetic spectra do not include alkali metal lines , we fit the @xmath0 spectrum between 1.215 and 1.298@xmath13 m to determine the metallicity from the depth of the h@xmath8o absorption features . \n figure 8 shows the effect of the metallicity on the spectrum ( top panel ) and our best fit ( bottom panel ) for model b. the flux level in the @xmath0 spectrum varies by a factor of 3 and our best fit shows distortions in the general shape of the spectrum . \n the distortions may be caused by a combination of uncertainties in the @xmath43 profile of the atmosphere , problems with the h@xmath8o opacities or a small amount of dust opacity in the infrared spectrum of gl 229b ( not modeled ) . since the fit is based on the depth of the features , we ignore these distortions and fit the logarithm of the flux rather than the flux , as shown in fig . \n 8 . as in the red spectrum (  5.1 ) \n , we find a remarkable correspondence of spectral features between the observed and modeled spectra although the model spectrum is somewhat less successful at reproducing the relative strengths of the h@xmath8o features . \n while the @xmath1 band spectrum falls between the red side of a strong h@xmath8o band ( for @xmath22 m ) and the blue side of a prominent ch@xmath9 band ( for @xmath99 m ) , nh@xmath3 and h@xmath8s have non - negligible opacity in this wavelength interval which also includes a band of co.    the strong ch@xmath9 band is responsible for the turnover of the flux at 1.59@xmath13 m . in this wavelength range , \n the ch@xmath9 opacity is described in our calculation by the @xcite laboratory measurements which are restricted to @xmath59k . as a consequence , \n the ch@xmath9 band comes in at 1.61@xmath13 m in the synthetic spectra , which results in strong departures of the mean flux level between data and models for @xmath100 m . \n this limits our analysis of the @xmath1 band spectrum to wavelengths shorter than 1.58@xmath13 m . in this wavelength range , \n the spectrum is formed deep in the atmosphere , where @xmath101k and @xmath102 bar ( fig . 6 ) . within this spectral region , \n we determine the abundance of nh@xmath3 as a function of the metallicity , but can not untangle the two . \n we also comment on the presence of h@xmath8s and co.      while nh@xmath3 absorption can significantly affect the slope of the spectrum shortward of 1.56@xmath13 m ( fig . \n 9 ) , there is no distinctive feature at this spectral resolution ( @xmath103 ) to provide an unambiguous detection of this molecule . \n the detection of co at 4.7@xmath13 m well above the equilibrium abundance @xcite suggests the possibility that nh@xmath3 may also depart from its chemical equilibrium abundance @xcite . \n we therefore vary the abundance of nh@xmath3 by reducing its chemical equilibrium abundance  _ as computed for a given metallicity _  uniformly throughout the atmosphere by constant factor . \n we found that reduction factors of 1 , 0.5 , 0.25 , and 0 provide an adequate grid of nh@xmath3 abundances given the s / n ratio of the data and the residual problems with the h@xmath8o opacity . \n the effect of varying the metallicity on the @xmath1 band spectrum is shown in fig . \n 10 for model b. all spectra in figure 10 were computed with the equilibrium abundance of nh@xmath3 . in this case \n , we find a best fitting metallicity of [ m / h]@xmath104 . \n figures 9 and 10 show that varying the abundance of nh@xmath3 and varying the metallicity have very similar effects on the synthetic spectrum . in the absence of any distinctive feature of nh@xmath3 , \n it is not possible to determine both the metallicity and the nh@xmath3 abundance separately . for each value of [ m / h ] \n , we can adjust the nh@xmath3 abundance to obtain a good fit , higher metallicities requiring lower nh@xmath3 abundances . \n the best fitting solutions are given in table 2 . \n these fits are nearly indistinguishable from each other although the higher metallicity fits are marginally better . \n it is in the @xmath1 band that we find the poorest match in the detailed features of the data and the models . while the fit is determined by matching the relative amplitudes of the features , the two - parameter fit ( metallicity and nh@xmath3 abundance ) we have performed amounts to little more than fitting the slope of the spectrum . as an internal check on our fitting procedure and precision , \n we have have verified that our fits indeed have the same slope as the data by plotting data and models at a very low spectral resolution which eliminates all absorption features . \n hydrogen sulfide ( h@xmath8s ) has non - negligible opacity over most of the wavelength range of our fit to the @xmath1 band . \n figure 11 shows two spectra computed with and without h@xmath8s opacity . its opacity is weaker than that of nh@xmath3 however , and there are no distinctive features which would allow a positive identification . since the h@xmath8s features are fairly uniformly distributed in strength and wavelength , fitting the spectrum with either the chemical equilibrium abundance of h@xmath8s or with no h@xmath8s at all only has a small - to - negligible effect on the determination of the nh@xmath3 abundance for a given metallicity ( table 2 ) . \n for the low gravity model a , the nh@xmath3 abundance determined from spectra without h@xmath8s is about half of the value found with the chemical equilibrium abundance of h@xmath8s . \n the difference decreases at higher gravities and is negligible for model c.    chemical equilibrium calculations @xcite indicate that h@xmath8s is present in gl 229b with an abundance essentially equal to the elemental abundance of sulfur in the atmosphere ( see  6.3 for further discussion ) . \n unfortunately , we are unable to ascertain the presence of h@xmath8s in the atmosphere of gl 229b at present . \n the discovery of co in the 4.7@xmath13 m spectrum of gl 229b with an abundance about 3 orders of magnitude higher than predicted by chemical equilibrium revealed the importance of dynamical processes in its atmosphere @xcite . \n the 4.7@xmath13 m spectrum probes the atmosphere at the 2  3 bar level where @xmath105k ( fig . \n 6 ) . at this level , \n chemical equilibrium calculations predict a co abundance of @xmath106 while @xcite found @xmath107 . \n the second overtone band of co falls within the @xmath1 band and , in principle , could provide a determination of @xmath108 at a deeper level of the atmosphere , where @xmath109 bar and @xmath110k ( fig . 6 ) . \n figure 12 shows a comparison of the data with synthetic spectra computed with various amounts of co for model b with solar metallicity . \n the first two spectra are computed with the chemical equilibrium abundance of co ( @xmath111 at 14@xmath10bar ) and without co ( @xmath112 ) . \n these two spectra are very nearly identical . \n a third spectrum is computed in the unrealistic limit where all the carbon in the atmosphere is in the form of co ( @xmath113 ) , which represents the maximum possible co enhancement . as we found for nh@xmath3 and h@xmath8s \n , there is no distinctive spectral signature of co at this resolution ( @xmath103 ) . \n our extreme case represents a flux reduction of @xmath114 at best . \n we are unable to constrain the co abundance with our data . \n since the @xmath115 band of co is @xmath116 times weaker than the fundamental band at 4.7@xmath13 m , obtaining a useful co abundance from @xmath1 band spectroscopy will be a difficult undertaking .      of our three near infrared spectra \n , the @xmath2 band spectrum is formed highest in the atmosphere : @xmath117  1020@xmath10k and @xmath118bar ( fig . \n this is the same level as is probed with 4.7@xmath13 m spectroscopy . as in the @xmath1 band , \n the spectrum contains mainly h@xmath8o features on the blue side ( @xmath119 m ) and a strong ch@xmath9 band appears at longer wavelengths . \n there are also several nh@xmath3 features for @xmath120 m and the models predict an isolated feature of h@xmath8s ( fig . \n 3 ) .    figure 13 compares a spectrum computed for model b with [ m / h]@xmath104 with the entire @xmath2 band spectrum . \n there is an excellent agreement in the structure of the spectrum even though the overall shape is not very well reproduced . for @xmath120 \n m , the model predicts strong features of nh@xmath3 which we discuss in the next section . beyond 2.12@xmath13 m \n is a ch@xmath9 band which is too weak in the model . \n the structure within the modeled band is remarkably similar to the observed spectrum , however . \n this much better agreement of the ch@xmath9 band than we obtained in the @xmath1 band is due to two factors . \n first , in this band the ch@xmath9 opacity is computed from a line list , and can therefore be computed as a function of temperature rather than at a fixed value of 300@xmath10k . \n second , the lower temperature where the band is formed ( fig . \n 6 ) reduces the effect of the incompleteness of the ch@xmath9 line list above 300@xmath10k . \n nevertheless , we do not consider the ch@xmath9 features here and limit our analysis to @xmath121 m . \n the @xmath2 band spectrum provides a unique opportunity : once the metallicity is determined by matching the depth of the h@xmath8o features between 2.05 and 2.10@xmath13 m , the abundance of nh@xmath3 can be obtained by fitting its features below 2.05@xmath13 m . \n the fit of the metallicity is shown in fig . \n 14 for model b , which shows [ m / h]=0 and @xmath40 ( top panel ) and our best fit , [ m / h]=@xmath93 ( bottom panel ) . \n values for models a and c are given in table 2 . \n all features in this region are due to h@xmath8o and , as we found in the red spectrum and in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands , the oscillator strengths of the h@xmath8o line list do not reproduce the relative strength of the observed features very well .      in the wavelength range shown in fig . \n 15 , the spectrum consists of a few nh@xmath3 features on a background of h@xmath8o absorption . \n synthetic spectra predict seven strong nh@xmath3 features in this spectrum , three of which are clearly present ( 2.033 , 2.037 and 2.046@xmath13 m ) , one is absent ( 2.041@xmath13 m ) and three appear to be missing ( 2.026 , 2.029 and 2.031@xmath13 m ) . \n this constitutes an ambiguous detection of nh@xmath3 in gl 229b . \n the determination of the abundance of nh@xmath3 from the @xmath2 band spectrum is hampered by the limited accuracy of the oscillator strengths of the h@xmath8o line list and by the incompleteness of our nh@xmath3 line list for temperatures above 300@xmath10k . \n the effect of the former can be seen in the trio of features at 2.026 , 2.029 and 2.031@xmath13 m , which overlap h@xmath8o absorption features . even after removing all nh@xmath3 opacity , these features are still too strong in the calculated spectrum ( top panel of fig . \n the top panel of fig . \n 15 as well as fig . \n 13 show that for model b , the abundance of nh@xmath3 derived from the chemical equilibrium for the adopted metallicity of [ m / h]@xmath104 is too high . \n we therefore consider a depletion in nh@xmath3 in the atmosphere of gl 229b at the level probed by the @xmath2 band spectrum . \n following the approach used in fitting the @xmath1 band spectrum , we express this depletion as a fraction of the chemical equilibrium abundance of nh@xmath3 for the metallicity obtained independently from the amplitude of the h@xmath8o features in the @xmath2 band . \n this fraction is applied uniformly throughout the atmosphere for the computation of the synthetic spectrum . \n given the ambiguous presence of nh@xmath3 in the @xmath2 band , we have determined the optimal nh@xmath3 abundance by minimizing the @xmath122 of the spectral fit for @xmath123 m . \n this gives a depletion factor of @xmath124 with no nh@xmath3 present being an acceptable fit . restricting the fit to the region where nh@xmath3 features are clearly observed ( @xmath125 ) \n gives a similar result but favors a finite value for the nh@xmath3 depletion of @xmath126 . \n the results are summarized in table 2 . \n the lower panel of figure 15 shows the model b fit obtained by reducing the nh@xmath3 abundance throughout the atmosphere to @xmath127% of its chemical equilibrium value _ for the adopted metallicity_. with this significant degree of depletion , the model reproduces the three detected features ( 2.033 , 2.037 and 2.046@xmath13 m ) extremely well and makes the 2.041@xmath13 m feature consistent with the observations .    because our nh@xmath3 line list is incomplete at high temperatures , the opacity which we compute is strictly a lower limit to the actual nh@xmath3 opacity at any wavelength . \n if the incompleteness is significant for the features found in the @xmath2 band spectrum , then the nh@xmath3 abundance is actually lower still . \n it appears extremely unlikely that the errors in the oscillator strength of the h@xmath8o transitions would conspire to mimic the depletion of nh@xmath3 which we find . \n for example , if we imagine that there is no nh@xmath3 depletion ( dotted curve in the top panel of fig . \n 14 ) , the residuals between the data and the fitted spectrum for @xmath120 m would be much larger than the typical mismatch which we find in h@xmath8o features in all four spectra presented here . \n we consider the depletion of nh@xmath3 in the @xmath2 band spectrum to be firmly established . \n we are not able to establish the presence of h@xmath8s from our @xmath1 band spectrum (  5.3.2 ) . throughout the @xmath2 band , \n the h@xmath8s opacity is generally overwhelmed by h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 absorption . \n however , there is a peak in the opacity of h@xmath8s which is about one order of magnitude higher than all other opacity maxima ( fig . \n our synthetic spectra indicate that this feature is strong enough to become visible in the midst of the background of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 features . \n figure 17 shows the relevant portion of the @xmath2 band spectrum with synthetic spectra for all three models ( a , b , and c ) using the fitted metallicity ( table 2 ) . \n all three panels are remarkably similar . \n the strength of the predicted feature is well above the noise level of the data , and taken at face value , figure 17 indicates a probable depletion of h@xmath8s by more than a factor of 2 . on the other hand , \n chemical equilibrium calculations indicate that the h@xmath8s abundance should be very near the elemental abundance of sulfur , even in the presence of vertical transport and condensation @xcite . \n since there is no reason to expect a significant depletion of h@xmath8s , the discrepancy is probably due to remaining uncertainties in the opacities . \n our h@xmath8s line list is based on an ab initio calculation ( r. wattson , priv . \n which hasnt been compared to laboratory data in this part of the spectrum . \n the strong feature centered at 2.1084@xmath13 m is a blend of three strong lines from three different bands of h@xmath8s . \n possible errors in the position or strength of these lines could significantly reduce the amplitude of the feature in our synthetic spectra . \n the limitations of the background opacity of h@xmath8o and ch@xmath9 may also be responsible for the observed mismatch . \n nevertheless , it is desirable to look for this feature at a higher resolution and a higher s / n ratio as an absence of sulfur in gl 229b would be a most intriguing result .      given our determination of @xmath14 and [ m / h ] in terms of the surface gravity , we can obtain the abundance of co from the 45@xmath13 m spectra of @xcite and @xcite which is consistent with our results . \n for each model  a , b , and c  and using the metallicity given in table 2 , we computed synthetic spectra with various co abundances . \n the latter is varied freely without imposing stoichiometric constraints . \n the synthetic spectra are binned to the wavelength grid of the data and fitted to the data by a normalization factor adjusted to minimize the @xmath122 . \n the @xmath122 of the fitted spectra shows a well - defined minimum as a function of the co abundance , @xmath108 ( table 3 ) . \n the uncertainty on the co abundance is obtained by generating synthetic data sets by adding a gaussian distribution of the observed noise to the best fitting model spectrum . after doing the same analysis on 1000 synthetic data sets , \n we obtain a ( non - gaussian ) distribution of values of @xmath108 . \n the uncertainties given in table 3 correspond to the 68% confidence level . \n the @xcite spectrum gives co abundances which are 0.1 dex higher than those obtained from the @xcite spectrum ; which is well within the fitting uncertainty . \n @xcite found a co mole fraction of 50 to 200 ppm ( @xmath128 ) by assuming a h@xmath8o abundance of 300 ppm ( effectively , [ m / h]@xmath129 ) , which agrees well with our result for model a which has [ m / h]@xmath130 . \n our results are also consistent with those of @xcite who find co abundances of @xmath131 and @xmath132 ppm ( @xmath133 and @xmath134 ) for [ m / h]=@xmath135 and 0 , respectively , using the data of @xcite . \n since this part of the spectrum contains only h@xmath8o and co features , our fitting procedure is sensitive only to the co to h@xmath8o abundance ratio . \n chemical equilibrium calculations show that the h@xmath8o abundance scales linearly with the metallicity at the level probed with 45@xmath13 m spectroscopy ( _ i.e. _ all the gas phase oxygen is in h@xmath8o ) . \n accordingly , the co abundance we find scales with the metallicity of the model . \n as shown in figure 18 , the co abundance determined from the 4.7@xmath13 m band corresponds approximately to the co / ch@xmath9 transition in chemical equilibrium . \n the observations definitely exclude the very - low chemical equilibrium abundance of co. the fact that the extreme case where all carbon is co provides an acceptable fit to the data ( while we know that a good fraction of the carbon is in ch@xmath9 ) is due to the rather noisy spectra . \n it is highly desirable to restrict the surface gravity @xmath27 of gl 229b to an astrophysically useful range . \n since @xmath33 is known , a determination of @xmath27 fixes @xmath14 , the radius , the mass , and the age of gl 229b ( fig . \n 4 ) , as well as the metallicity and the abundances of important molecules such as co and nh@xmath3 . the large uncertainty on @xmath27 results in a large uncertainty in the mass of gl 229b and on the age of the system determined from cooling tracks . \n while a dynamical determination of the mass may be possible in a decade or so @xcite , a spectroscopic determination might be obtained much sooner . \n unfortunately , it is not possible to constrain the gravity better than @xmath136 with the data and models presently available . \n our high resolution spectroscopy does not allow us to choose between models a , b and c ( table 2 ) as an increase in gravity can be compensated by an increase in metallicity to lead to an identical fit . \n the gravity sensitivity of the @xmath2 band synthetic spectrum models reported by @xcite occurs for a fixed metallicity only . \n similarly , @xcite and @xcite report that the spectral energy distribution of gl 229b models is fairly sensitive to the gravity . \n but this is true only for a fixed metallicity . for the three models indicated in fig . 4 , and using the metallicity we have determined for each ( table 2 ) the gravity dependence of the infrared colors is @xmath137 and @xmath138 and @xmath139 ( table 4 ) . \n this dependence is very weak in the light of the uncertainty in the photometry of gl 229b . \n more problematic is the fact that the synthetic @xmath140 disagrees with the photometry . \n furthermore , the incomplete ch@xmath9 opacities used in the spectrum calculation almost certainly result in an inaccurate redistribution of the flux in the near infrared opacity windows which determines the broad band colors . \n an example of this effect on the @xmath1 band flux can be seen in fig . \n we conclude that a photometric determination of the gravity is not possible at present . \n an alternative approach to determining the gravity of gl 229b is through a study of the pressure - broadened molecular lines of its spectrum . \n the spectrum of gl 229b is formed of a forest of unresolved molecular lines maily due to h@xmath8o , ch@xmath9 , and nh@xmath3 . \n because of the limitations of the ch@xmath9 and nh@xmath3 opacity data bases , a detailed study of molecular features is best performed in spectral domains where these two molecules do not contribute significantly to the opacity . \n spectroscopic observations with a resolution of @xmath141 can reveal the shape of individual h@xmath8o lines in regions where they are relatively sparse , _ \n e.g. _ from 2.08 to 2.105@xmath13 m . \n our determination of the metallicity of gl 229b , with an uncertainty of @xmath70 , is given in table 2 for the three gravities considered . \n we find an excellent agreement between our three independent determinations of [ m / h ] for each gravity and conclude that gl 229b is likely to be depleted in heavy elements , _ e.g. _ oxygen . \n the metallicity is near solar at high gravity and decreases significantly for lower gravities . in their analysis of the `` red '' spectrum \n , @xcite found a h@xmath8o abundance between 0.3 and 0.45 of the solar value for a @xmath142k , @xmath50 model and they adopt a value of 0.25 in @xcite . \n metal depletion in gl 229b is consistent with the analysis of the 0.985 \n 1.02@xmath13 m feh band in the spectrum of the primary star gl 229a by schiavon , barbuy & singh ( 1997 ) who find [ fe / h]@xmath143 . \n the infrared colors of gl 229a imply that it is slightly metal - rich , however @xcite . \n the relative metallicity of the components of this binary system may have been affected by their formation process . \n if the pair formed from the fragmentation of a collapsing cloud ( like a binary star system ) , the two objects should share the same composition . \n if the brown dwarf formed like a planet , from accretion within a dissipative keplerian disk around the primary , the selective accretion of solid phase material could lead to an _ enrichment _ in heavy elements compared to the primary star , as is observed in the gaseous planets of the solar system . \n the low mass of the primary ( @xmath144 ) and the large semi - major axis and eccentricity ( @xmath145au and @xmath146 , @xcite ) suggests that the binary formation process , and therefore equal metallicities , are more plausible . \n a more detailed study of the metallicity of gl 229a is desirable to better understand the history of this system . \n the results of our analysis of the metallicity and abundances of several molecules in the atmosphere of gl 229b are summarized in fig \n each panel corresponds to a different model ( see table 2 ) and shows the abundances of important molecules as a function of depth in the atmosphere based on chemical equilibrium calculations including condensation cloud formation . \n the chemistry of these abundant molecules is fairly simple . \n the abundance of h@xmath8o is uniformly reduced by @xmath147% by silicate condensation . except for a small depletion for @xmath148 due to the condensation of na@xmath8s \n , all sulfur is found in h@xmath8s . \n the other molecules shown are not affected by condensation . \n nitrogen is partitioned between n@xmath8 and nh@xmath3 , with the latter being favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures . \n nh@xmath3 dominates near the surface and rapidly transforms into n@xmath8 at the higher temperatures found deeper in the atmosphere . \n deep in the atmosphere , the higher pressures cause a partial recombination of nh@xmath3 and the ratio of the nh@xmath3 to n@xmath8 abundances increases slowly with depth . in a similar fashion , \n all elemental carbon is found in ch@xmath9 at the surface but co starts to form at higher temperatures and rapidly becomes the most abundant carbon - bearing molecule . \n the formation of co consumes h@xmath8o , as can be seen in fig . \n 18 .    in each panel \n , a dotted box indicates the co abundance we have determined from the 4.7@xmath13 m spectrum , the location of the box along the ordinate shows the level probed at this wavelength ( fig . \n 6 ) . as originally discussed by @xcite and @xcite , \n the co abundance is @xmath149 orders of magnitude larger than the chemical equilibrium value . \n stochiometric constraints imply that this also results in a significant reduction of the ch@xmath9 abundance at the 870  950@xmath10k level in gl 229b . in model b , \n the equilibrium abundance of ch@xmath9 at 900@xmath10k is @xmath150 , which corresponds to the abundance of elemental carbon . \n the co abundance determined from the 4.7@xmath13 m band is @xmath151 ( with a large error bar ) . \n conservation of the total number of carbon atoms then requires that the ch@xmath9 abundance be @xmath152 , a full factor of 2 below the equilibrium abundance . \n if we use the lowest co abundance allowed by our analysis , a 25% reduction of ch@xmath9 relative to its equilibrium abundance at 900@xmath10k results . \n depletion of ch@xmath9 at this depth is readily accessible spectroscopically in the 1.6 and 3.3@xmath13 m bands , and may also affect the 2.3@xmath13 m band if the non - equilibrium co abundance persists at higher levels ( fig . \n after h@xmath8o , ch@xmath9 is the most important near infrared molecular absorber in gl 229b . \n accurate modeling of the spectrum demands a careful treatment of the non - equilibrium ch@xmath9 abundance . \n similarly , solid boxes show the nh@xmath3 abundance determined from our @xmath1 and @xmath2 band spectra . \n while the @xmath1 band abundance is in excellent agreement with the equilibrium value , there is a clear depletion of nh@xmath3 in the @xmath2 band . \n the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band abundances are marginally consistent with each other but it appears that the nh@xmath3 abundance decreases upwards through the atmosphere . \n processes which take place faster than the time scale of key chemical reactions can drive the composition of the mixture away from equilibrium . \n the case of co / ch@xmath9 chemistry has been well - studied in the atmosphere of jupiter where an overabundance of co is also observed . \n carbon monoxyde is a strongly bound molecule and the conversion of co to ch@xmath9 through the ( schematic ) reaction @xmath153 proceeds relatively slowly , while the reverse reaction is much faster . \n vertical transport , if vigorous enough , can carry co - rich gas from deeper levels upwards faster than the co to ch@xmath9 reaction can take place . \n the co / ch@xmath9 ratio at any level is fixed ( `` quenched '' ) by the condition @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the chemical reaction time scale and @xmath156 the dynamical transport time scale . \n wherever @xmath157 in the presence of a vertical gradient in the equilibrium abundance , non - equilibrium abundances will result .    as discussed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( and references therein ) \n , this naturally explains the very high co abundance observed at the 900@xmath10k level . in this picture , \n co - rich gas would be carried upward from @xmath158k . \n convection is the most obvious form of vertical transport in a stellar atmosphere but in gl 229b the convection zone remains about 3 pressure scale heights below the level where co is observed ( shaded area in fig . \n perhaps convective overshooting can transport co to the observed level . \n @xcite propose `` eddy diffusion '' as a slower , yet adequate transport mechanism . \n the eddy diffusion ( or mixing ) time scale is constrained by the poorly known co abundance and the somewhat uncertain chemical pathway between co and ch@xmath9 . from @xcite \n , we infer that @xmath159 to 10 years and could be much smaller .    in analogy to the co / ch@xmath9 equilibrium , a low nh@xmath3 abundance can be explained by vertical transport which can quench the nh@xmath3/n@xmath8 ratio at a value found in deeper layers in the atmosphere . as it is carried upward , \n n@xmath8 is converted to nh@xmath3 by the reaction @xmath160 the n@xmath8 molecule is very strongly bound , however , and this reaction proceeds extremely slowly at low temperatures , much more slowly than reaction ( 2 ) . \n thermochemical kinetic calculations of the chemical lifetime for conversion of n@xmath8 to nh@xmath3 were performed as described in @xcite . the time scale for reaction ( 4 ) along the @xmath71 profiles of models a , b , and c and for @xmath161bar is given by @xmath162 where @xmath155 is in year , @xmath163 is the temperature in k , and @xmath27 is the surface gravity in cm / s@xmath164 . \n this time scale assumes that the n@xmath8 conversion occurs in the gas phase although it could possibly be shortened by catalysis on the surface of grains . \n the time scale increases very steeply with decreasing temperature . at the level probed in the @xmath1 band , @xmath165 and @xmath166 and in the @xmath2 band , @xmath167 and @xmath168 ! at some intermediate level ( which depends on @xmath27 ) , the time scale for the conversion of n@xmath8 into nh@xmath3 becomes longer than the age of gl 229b . \n in view of the relatively very short mixing time scale inferred from the co abundance , it follows that the nh@xmath3 abundance in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands is _ entirely _ determined by non - equilibrium processes , _ not _ by reaction ( 4 ) . at depths \n where @xmath169 ( which corresponds to the top of the convection zone ) , @xmath170yr and the reaction proceeds fast enough to establish chemical equilibrium between nh@xmath3 and n@xmath8 . \n we therefore expect that the n@xmath8/nh@xmath3 ratio will be quenched at its value at @xmath171 , throughout the remainder of the atmosphere . while the time scale for eddy diffusion increases in the upper levels of the atmosphere , the extremely long @xmath155 ensures that the nh@xmath3/n@xmath8 ratio remains unchanged , regardless of how slowly the vertical mixing proceeds . for model \n b , this corresponds to @xmath172 , in perfect agreement with the abundance found in the @xmath1 band ( fig . \n 18b ) .    while the abundance of nh@xmath3 determined from the @xmath2 band spectrum is not very precise , it is marginally consistent with vertical mixing \n figure 18 shows that it is more likely that the @xmath2 band abundance is smaller than found in the @xmath1 band , however . on the other hand , the abundances shown in fig . \n 18 and table 2 are depletion factors which were applied uniformly to the chemical equilibrium abundance profile of nh@xmath3 , which has a large vertical gradient . for consistency with the mixed atmosphere picture , \n we have therefore redetermined nh@xmath3 abundances using a constant abundance throughout the atmosphere and found @xmath173 and @xmath174 from the @xmath2 and @xmath1 band spectra , respectively ( model b ) . \n the former is in good agreement with our simple prediction while the @xmath1 band value is now rather high . \n the discrepancy between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band results thus persists in this new analysis . \n changes in [ m / h ] within the @xmath70 uncertainty have little effect either . \n we consider the possibility that this vertical gradient in the nh@xmath3 abundance may be caused by a different non - equilibrium process such as the photolysis of nh@xmath3 by the uv flux from the primary star . \n ammonia is a relatively fragile molecule which is easily dissociated by uv photons : @xmath175 with a photodissociation cross section of @xmath176cm@xmath164 per molecule , optical depth unity for the photodissociation of nh@xmath3 is reached at pressures of a few millibars in gl 229b . \n photodissociation of the much more abundant h@xmath8 molecules does not effectively shield nh@xmath3 from incoming uv photons since the two molecules absorb over different wavelength ranges . \n photodissociation of nh@xmath3 therefore represents a net sink of nh@xmath3 which occurs at the very top of the atmosphere . \n we can estimate a lower limit to the time scale of photodissociation of nh@xmath3 by assuming that each photodissociating photon results in the destruction of a nh@xmath3 molecule . \n the incident photon flux is @xmath178 where photons causing dissociation of nh@xmath3 are between @xmath179 and @xmath180 , @xmath181 is the flux at the surface of the primary star , @xmath182 the radius of the primary star and @xmath79 the separation of the binary system . for nh@xmath3 \n , we have @xmath183  and @xmath184  ( moses , priv . comm . ) . \n the primary star has a dm1 spectral type , with @xmath185erg@xmath10@xmath186s@xmath88@xmath46 and @xmath187 cm @xcite . \n the binary separation is @xmath188au @xcite . \n this results in @xmath189@xmath186s@xmath88 . \n photodissociation will affect significantly the nh@xmath3 abundance when @xmath190 where @xmath84 is the column density of nh@xmath3 . because the incident flux of uv photons is fairly low , \n this condition is satisfied only at pressures below a few microbars , _ i.e. _ very high in the atmosphere . in the region of interest \n , photodissociation destroys a very small fraction of nh@xmath3 during one mixing time scale and therefore has little effect on the abundance of nh@xmath3 . \n photolysis of nh@xmath3 can not explain the relatively low nh@xmath3 abundance we find in the @xmath2 band spectrum . \n we believe that the difference between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band determinations of the nh@xmath3 abundance arise from the limitations of the nh@xmath3 opacity data used for the calculation of the synthetic spectra . as discussed above , the incompleteness of the nh@xmath3 line list for @xmath66k results in upper limits for the nh@xmath3 abundances obtained by fitting the data . \n since this effect increases with temperature , we expect that the abundance determined from the @xmath1 band spectrum is overestimated relative to the one obtained from the @xmath2 band spectrum , which is what we observe . \n until nh@xmath3 opacities become available for @xmath191  1200@xmath10k , we will not be able to quantify this effect . \n figures 6 and 18 show that ammonia offers a third window of opportunity for a determination of its abundance . \n the region between 8.3 and 14.4@xmath13 m is rich in strong nh@xmath3 features , the two strongest being at 10.35 and 10.75@xmath13 m ( fig . \n this spectral region probes a higher level in the atmosphere ( @xmath192k ) where the hot bands of nh@xmath3 which are missing from opacity data bases are less problematic than in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands . in this spectral region , \n the spectrum is very sensitive to the nh@xmath3/h@xmath8o ratio , especially for nh@xmath3 abundances below 25% of the equilibrium value ( fig . \n this would allow a good determination of the degree of nh@xmath3 depletion in the upper levels of the atmosphere . \n we anticipate that 10@xmath13 m spectroscopy should reveal a nh@xmath3 abundance of @xmath193% of its equilibrium value . \n with the availability of extensive photometric , astrometric , and spectroscopic data , our picture of the atmosphere of gl 229b is gradually becoming more exotic and more complex . \n the initial discovery of ch@xmath9 in its spectrum set it appart and has prompted the creation of a new spectral class , the t dwarfs . \n h@xmath8o , co , cs i , and k i have also been detected . \n there is good evidence that the rapid decrease of the flux at visible wavelengths is caused by unprecedently broad lines of atomic alkali metals @xcite . \n the presence of condensates may also play a role in shaping the spectrum of gl 229b . \n it is unfortunate that the surface gravity of gl 229b remains poorly constrained . \n we have not been able to further restrict the allowed range with our new @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 spectroscopy . as a result , \n all our results are expressed as a function of gravity . \n this is the most significant obstacle to further progress in elucidating the astrophysics of this t dwarf . \n the surface gravity can probably be determined from the study of the pressure broadened shape of molecular lines . \n we have found good evidence for the presence of nh@xmath3 in the spectrum of gl 229b , which was expected from chemical equilibrium calculations . \n we have been able to determine its abundance at two different levels in the atmosphere , and we find a significant deviation from chemical equilibrium . \n a similar situation has been found with co previously @xcite and this abundance pattern can be explained by vertical mixing in the atmosphere . \n the extent of the convection zone is not sufficient to account for the abundances we find and the mixing may be due to overshooting or to less efficient eddy diffusion . we find that nh@xmath3 photolysis is not important in shaping the spectrum of gl 229b . because nh@xmath3 can be observed in three different bands corresponding to three distinct depths in the atmosphere , an accurate determination of its abundance in each band provides information on the time scale of mixing as a function of depth . \n this is an unusual and powerful diagnostic tool which can provide valuable clues for modeling the vertical distributions of possible condensates . in principle , any absorber with a large abundance gradient through the visible part of the atmosphere can be used to infer the details of the mixing process . among detected and abundant molecules , only co and nh@xmath3 \n satisfy this criterion . \n chemical equilibrium calculations with rainout of condensates @xcite show that we can expect significant vertical gradients in the abundances of atomic k , rb , cs , and na as they become bound in molecules ( kcl , rbcl , cscl and na@xmath8s , respectively ) in the cooler , upper reaches of the atmosphere . \n cesium and potassium have been detected in the spectrum of gl 229b , and resonance doublets of k \n i and na i appear to shape the visible spectrum . \n however , the chemical timescales for alkali metals are so short that they should always remain in thermodynamic equilibrium ( lodders 1999 ) . \n therefore , they can not serve as probes of vertical mixing in gl 229b . \n further progress in understanding the atmosphere of gl 229b requires better opacities for ch@xmath9 and nh@xmath3 , and , to a lesser extent , of h@xmath8o . \n a more accurate determination of the co abundance from 4  5@xmath13 m spectroscopy is very desirable and will require higher signal - to - noise spectroscopy than is currently available . \n similarly , 10@xmath13 m spectroscopy to determine the nh@xmath3 abundance for @xmath194bar , while difficult , is important . \n the issue of vertical mixing and departures from chemical equilibrium gains importance when we consider that the observed departure of co from chemical equilibrium implies a significantly reduced ch@xmath9 abundance , by conservation of the abundance of elemental carbon . \n similarly , our results imply that nh@xmath3 absorption in the 10@xmath13 m region is reduced . \n because ch@xmath9 is a significant absorber in the near infrared , as is nh@xmath3 in the 10@xmath13 m range , departures from equilibrium must be taken into account when accurate modeling of the atmosphere and spectrum of gl 229b is desired . \n this new level of complexity compounds the exoticism and the challenges posed by t dwarfs . \n the astrophysics of gl 229b is far richer than has been originally anticipated . \n gl 229b is currently the only t dwarf known to be in a binary system . \n there is no evidence that the illumination from the primary star has a significant effect on the state of its atmosphere and gl 229b is most likely typical of isolated t dwarfs . \n it remains the brightest and by far the best studied of the seven t dwarfs currently known , but the list should expand to several dozens during the next 2  3 years @xcite . \n the existing body of work on gl 229b points to the most rewarding observations to conduct on t dwarfs . \n the possibility of studying trends in the physics of t dwarf atmospheres as a function of effective temperature is a fascinating prospect . \n we thank t. guillot for sharing programs which were most useful to our analysis , j. moses for invaluable information regarding the photolysis of

        "abstract": "The study examines high-resolution infrared spectra of the T dwarf Gliese 229b to assess its metallicity, NH₃, and CO abundances. It finds metallicity increases with gravity, remaining sub-solar unless Gliese 229b has high gravity. NH₃ levels in the upper atmosphere, derived from spectral analysis, are below chemical equilibrium, indicating atmospheric dynamical processes. This aligns with prior CO findings, offering insight into atmospheric transport mechanisms in T dwarfs. The research enhances understanding of Gliese 229b's atmospheric composition and dynamics, contributing to broader knowledge of brown dwarf atmospheres."

        "article": "for about 20 years the problem of properties of short - term changes of solar activity has been considered extensively . \n many investigators studied the short - term periodicities of the various indices of solar activity . \n several periodicities were detected , but the periodicities about 155 days and from the interval of @xmath3 $ ] days ( @xmath4 $ ] years ) are mentioned most often . \n first of them was discovered by @xcite in the occurence rate of gamma - ray flares detected by the gamma - ray spectrometer aboard the _ solar maximum mission ( smm ) . \n this periodicity was confirmed for other solar flares data and for the same time period @xcite . \n it was also found in proton flares during solar cycles 19 and 20 @xcite , but it was not found in the solar flares data during solar cycles 22 @xcite . \n _    several autors confirmed above results for the daily sunspot area data . @xcite studied the sunspot data from 18741984 . \n she found the 155-day periodicity in data records from 31 years . \n this periodicity is always characteristic for one of the solar hemispheres ( the southern hemisphere for cycles 1215 and the northern hemisphere for cycles 1621 ) . \n moreover , it is only present during epochs of maximum activity ( in episodes of 13 years ) . \n similarinvestigationswerecarriedoutby + @xcite . \n they applied the same power spectrum method as lean , but the daily sunspot area data ( cycles 1221 ) were divided into 10 shorter time series . \n the periodicities were searched for the frequency interval 57115 nhz ( 100200 days ) and for each of 10 time series . \n the authors showed that the periodicity between 150160 days is statistically significant during all cycles from 16 to 21 . \n the considered peaks were remained unaltered after removing the 11-year cycle and applying the power spectrum analysis . \n @xcite used the wavelet technique for the daily sunspot areas between 1874 and 1993 . \n they determined the epochs of appearance of this periodicity and concluded that it presents around the maximum activity period in cycles 16 to 21 . \n moreover , the power of this periodicity started growing at cycle 19 , decreased in cycles 20 and 21 and disappered after cycle 21 . \n similaranalyseswerepresentedby + @xcite , but for sunspot number , solar wind plasma , interplanetary magnetic field and geomagnetic activity index @xmath5 . \n during 1964 - 2000 the sunspot number wavelet power of periods less than one year shows a cyclic evolution with the phase of the solar cycle.the 154-day period is prominent and its strenth is stronger around the 1982 - 1984 interval in almost all solar wind parameters . \n the existence of the 156-day periodicity in sunspot data were confirmed by @xcite . \n they considered the possible relation between the 475-day ( 1.3-year ) and 156-day periodicities . \n the 475-day ( 1.3-year ) periodicity was also detected in variations of the interplanetary magnetic field , geomagnetic activity helioseismic data and in the solar wind speed @xcite . \n @xcite concluded that the region of larger wavelet power shifts from 475-day ( 1.3-year ) period to 620-day ( 1.7-year ) period and then back to 475-day ( 1.3-year ) . \n the periodicities from the interval @xmath6 $ ] days ( @xmath4 $ ] years ) have been considered from 1968 . \n @xcite mentioned a 16.3-month ( 490-day ) periodicity in the sunspot numbers and in the geomagnetic data . \n @xcite analysed the occurrence rate of major flares during solar cycles 19 . \n they found a 18-month ( 540-day ) periodicity in flare rate of the norhern hemisphere . \n @xcite confirmed this result for the @xmath7 flare data for solar cycles 20 and 21 and found a peak in the power spectra near 510540 days . \n @xcite found a 17-month ( 510-day ) periodicity of sunspot groups and their areas from 1969 to 1986 . \n these authors concluded that the length of this period is variable and the reason of this periodicity is still not understood . \n @xcite and + @xcite obtained statistically significant peaks of power at around 158 days for daily sunspot data from 1923 - 1933 ( cycle 16 ) . in this paper the problem of the existence of this periodicity for sunspot data from cycle 16 is considered . \n the daily sunspot areas , the mean sunspot areas per carrington rotation , the monthly sunspot numbers and their fluctuations , which are obtained after removing the 11-year cycle are analysed . in section 2 the properties of the power spectrum methods are described . in section 3 a new approach to the problem of aliases in the power spectrum analysis \n is presented . in section 4 numerical results of the new method of the diagnosis of an echo - effect for sunspot area data are discussed . in section 5 the problem of the existence of the periodicity of about 155 days during the maximum activity period for sunspot data from the whole solar disk and from each solar hemisphere separately is considered . \n to find periodicities in a given time series the power spectrum analysis is applied . in this paper \n two methods are used : the fast fourier transformation algorithm with the hamming window function ( fft ) and the blackman - tukey ( bt ) power spectrum method @xcite . \n the bt method is used for the diagnosis of the reasons of the existence of peaks , which are obtained by the fft method . \n the bt method consists in the smoothing of a cosine transform of an autocorrelation function using a 3-point weighting average . \n such an estimator is consistent and unbiased . \n moreover , the peaks are uncorrelated and their sum is a variance of a considered time series . the main disadvantage of this method is a weak resolution of the periodogram points , particularly for low frequences . \n for example , if the autocorrelation function is evaluated for @xmath8 , then the distribution points in the time domain are : @xmath9 thus , it is obvious that this method should not be used for detecting low frequency periodicities with a fairly good resolution . \n however , because of an application of the autocorrelation function , the bt method can be used to verify a reality of peaks which are computed using a method giving the better resolution ( for example the fft method ) . \n it is valuable to remember that the power spectrum methods should be applied very carefully . \n the difficulties in the interpretation of significant peaks could be caused by at least four effects : a sampling of a continuos function , an echo - effect , a contribution of long - term periodicities and a random noise . \n first effect exists because periodicities , which are shorter than the sampling interval , may mix with longer periodicities . in result , this effect can be reduced by an decrease of the sampling interval between observations . \n the echo - effect occurs when there is a latent harmonic of frequency @xmath10 in the time series , giving a spectral peak at @xmath10 , and also periodic terms of frequency @xmath11 etc . \n this may be detected by the autocorrelation function for time series with a large variance . \n time series often contain long - term periodicities , that influence short - term peaks . \n they could rise periodogram s peaks at lower frequencies . \n however , it is also easy to notice the influence of the long - term periodicities on short - term peaks in the graphs of the autocorrelation functions . \n this effect is observed for the time series of solar activity indexes which are limited by the 11-year cycle .    to find statistically significant periodicities \n it is reasonable to use the autocorrelation function and the power spectrum method with a high resolution . in the case of a stationary time \n series they give similar results . \n moreover , for a stationary time series with the mean zero the fourier transform is equivalent to the cosine transform of an autocorrelation function @xcite . \n thus , after a comparison of a periodogram with an appropriate autocorrelation function one can detect peaks which are in the graph of the first function and do not exist in the graph of the second function . \n the reasons of their existence could be explained by the long - term periodicities and the echo - effect . \n below method enables one to detect these effects . \n ( solid line ) and the 95% confidence level basing on thered noise ( dotted line ) . \n the periodogram values are presented on the left axis . \n the lower curve illustrates the autocorrelation function of the same time series ( solid line ) . \n the dotted lines represent two standard errors of the autocorrelation function . \n the dashed horizontal line shows the zero level . \n the autocorrelation values are shown in the right axis . ]     because the statistical tests indicate that the time series is a white noise the confidence level is not marked . ]    . ] \n the method of the diagnosis of an echo - effect in the power spectrum ( de ) consists in an analysis of a periodogram of a given time series computed using the bt method . \n the bt method bases on the cosine transform of the autocorrelation function which creates peaks which are in the periodogram , but not in the autocorrelation function . \n the de method is used for peaks which are computed by the fft method ( with high resolution ) and are statistically significant . \n the time series of sunspot activity indexes with the spacing interval one rotation or one month contain a markov - type persistence , which means a tendency for the successive values of the time series to remember their antecendent values . \n thus , i use a confidence level basing on the red noise of markov @xcite for the choice of the significant peaks of the periodogram computed by the fft method . \n when a time series does not contain the markov - type persistence i apply the fisher test and the kolmogorov - smirnov test at the significance level @xmath12 @xcite to verify a statistically significance of periodograms peaks . the fisher test checks the null hypothesis that the time series is white noise agains the alternative hypothesis that the time series contains an added deterministic periodic component of unspecified frequency . because the fisher test tends to be severe in rejecting peaks as insignificant the kolmogorov - smirnov test is also used . \n the de method analyses raw estimators of the power spectrum . \n they are given as follows    @xmath13    for @xmath14 + where @xmath15 for @xmath16 + @xmath17 is the length of the time series @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the mean value . \n the first term of the estimator @xmath20 is constant . \n the second term takes two values ( depending on odd or even @xmath21 ) which are not significant because @xmath22 for large m. thus , the third term of ( 1 ) should be analysed . \n looking for intervals of @xmath23 for which @xmath24 has the same sign and different signs one can find such parts of the function @xmath25 which create the value @xmath20 . \n let the set of values of the independent variable of the autocorrelation function be called @xmath26 and it can be divided into the sums of disjoint sets : @xmath27 where + @xmath28 + @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 + @xmath32 + @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 \n @xmath39 @xmath40    well , the set @xmath41 contains all integer values of @xmath23 from the interval of @xmath42 for which the autocorrelation function and the cosinus function with the period @xmath43 $ ] are positive . \n the index @xmath44 indicates successive parts of the cosinus function for which the cosinuses of successive values of @xmath23 have the same sign . \n however , sometimes the set @xmath41 can be empty . \n for example , for @xmath45 and @xmath46 the set @xmath47 should contain all @xmath48 $ ] for which @xmath49 and @xmath50 , but for such values of @xmath23 the values of @xmath51 are negative . \n thus , the set @xmath47 is empty .    . \n the periodogram values are presented on the left axis . \n the lower curve illustrates the autocorrelation function of the same time series . \n the autocorrelation values are shown in the right axis . ] \n let us take into consideration all sets \\{@xmath52 } , \\{@xmath53 } and \\{@xmath41 } which are not empty . because numberings and power of these sets depend on the form of the autocorrelation function of the given time series , it is impossible to establish them arbitrary . \n thus , the sets of appropriate indexes of the sets \\{@xmath52 } , \\{@xmath53 } and \\{@xmath41 } are called @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively . for example \n the set @xmath56 contains all @xmath44 from the set @xmath57 for which the sets @xmath41 are not empty . \n to separate quantitatively in the estimator @xmath20 the positive contributions which are originated by the cases described by the formula ( 5 ) from the cases which are described by the formula ( 3 ) the following indexes are introduced : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 taking for the empty sets \\{@xmath53 } and \\{@xmath41 } the indices @xmath65 and @xmath66 equal zero . \n the index @xmath65 describes a percentage of the contribution of the case when @xmath25 and @xmath51 are positive to the positive part of the third term of the sum ( 1 ) . \n the index @xmath66 describes a similar contribution , but for the case when the both @xmath25 and @xmath51 are simultaneously negative . \n thanks to these one can decide which the positive or the negative values of the autocorrelation function have a larger contribution to the positive values of the estimator @xmath20 . \n when the difference @xmath67 is positive , the statement the @xmath21-th peak really exists can not be rejected . \n thus , the following formula should be satisfied : @xmath68    because the @xmath21-th peak could exist as a result of the echo - effect , it is necessary to verify the second condition :    @xmath69\\in c_m.\\ ] ]    . \n the periodogram values are presented on the left axis . \n the lower curve illustrates the autocorrelation function of the same time series ( solid line ) . \n the dotted lines represent two standard errors of the autocorrelation function . \n the dashed horizontal line shows the zero level . \n the autocorrelation values are shown in the right axis . ]    to verify the implication ( 8) firstly it is necessary to evaluate the sets @xmath41 for @xmath70 of the values of @xmath23 for which the autocorrelation function and the cosine function with the period @xmath71 $ ] are positive and the sets @xmath72 of values of @xmath23 for which the autocorrelation function and the cosine function with the period @xmath43 $ ] are negative . \n secondly , a percentage of the contribution of the sum of products of positive values of @xmath25 and @xmath51 to the sum of positive products of the values of @xmath25 and @xmath51 should be evaluated . as a result the indexes @xmath65 for each set \n @xmath41 where @xmath44 is the index from the set @xmath56 are obtained . \n thirdly , from all sets @xmath41 such that @xmath70 the set @xmath73 for which the index @xmath65 is the greatest should be chosen .    the implication ( 8) is true when the set @xmath73 includes the considered period @xmath43 $ ] . \n this means that the greatest contribution of positive values of the autocorrelation function and positive cosines with the period @xmath43 $ ] to the periodogram value @xmath20 is caused by the sum of positive products of @xmath74 for each @xmath75-\\frac{m}{2k},[\\frac{2m}{k}]+\\frac{m}{2k})$ ] .    when the implication ( 8) is false , the peak @xmath20 is mainly created by the sum of positive products of @xmath74 for each @xmath76-\\frac{m}{2k},\\big [ \\frac{2m}{n}\\big ] + \\frac{m}{2k } \\big ) $ ] , where @xmath77 is a multiple or a divisor of @xmath21 . \n it is necessary to add , that the de method should be applied to the periodograms peaks , which probably exist because of the echo - effect . \n it enables one to find such parts of the autocorrelation function , which have the significant contribution to the considered peak . \n the fact , that the conditions ( 7 ) and ( 8) are satisfied , can unambiguously decide about the existence of the considered periodicity in the given time series , but if at least one of them is not satisfied , one can doubt about the existence of the considered periodicity . \n thus , in such cases the sentence the peak can not be treated as true should be used .    using the de method \n it is necessary to remember about the power of the set @xmath78 . \n if @xmath79 is too large , errors of an autocorrelation function estimation appear . \n they are caused by the finite length of the given time series and as a result additional peaks of the periodogram occur . if @xmath79 is too small , there are less peaks because of a low resolution of the periodogram . in applications \n @xmath80 is used . in order to evaluate the value \n @xmath79 the fft method is used . \n the periodograms computed by the bt and the fft method are compared . \n the conformity of them enables one to obtain the value @xmath79 .    . \n the fft periodogram values are presented on the left axis . \n the lower curve illustrates the bt periodogram of the same time series ( solid line and large black circles ) . \n the bt periodogram values are shown in the right axis . ] \n in this paper the sunspot activity data ( august 1923 - october 1933 ) provided by the greenwich photoheliographic results ( gpr ) are analysed . \n firstly , i consider the monthly sunspot number data . to eliminate the 11-year trend from these data , \n the consecutively smoothed monthly sunspot number @xmath81 is subtracted from the monthly sunspot number @xmath82 where the consecutive mean @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 the values @xmath83 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 are calculated using additional data from last six months of cycle 15 and first six months of cycle 17 .    because of the north - south asymmetry of various solar indices @xcite , the sunspot activity is considered for each solar hemisphere separately . \n analogously to the monthly sunspot numbers , the time series of sunspot areas in the northern and southern hemispheres with the spacing interval @xmath87 rotation are denoted . in order to find periodicities , \n the following time series are used : + @xmath88 \n + @xmath89 \n + @xmath90     + in the lower part of figure [ f1 ] the autocorrelation function of the time series for the northern hemisphere @xmath88 is shown . \n it is easy to notice that the prominent peak falls at 17 rotations interval ( 459 days ) and @xmath25 for @xmath91 $ ] rotations ( [ 81 , 162 ] days ) are significantly negative . \n the periodogram of the time series @xmath88 ( see the upper curve in figures [ f1 ] ) does not show the significant peaks at @xmath92 rotations ( 135 , 162 days ) , but there is the significant peak at @xmath93 ( 243 days ) . \n the peaks at @xmath94 are close to the peaks of the autocorrelation function . \n thus , the result obtained for the periodicity at about @xmath0 days are contradict to the results obtained for the time series of daily sunspot areas @xcite .    for the southern hemisphere ( the lower curve in figure [ f2 ] ) @xmath25 for @xmath95 $ ] rotations ( [ 54 , 189 ] days ) is not positive except @xmath96 ( 135 days ) for which @xmath97 is not statistically significant . \n the upper curve in figures [ f2 ] presents the periodogram of the time series @xmath89 . \n this time series does not contain a markov - type persistence . \n moreover , the kolmogorov - smirnov test and the fisher test do not reject a null hypothesis that the time series is a white noise only . \n this means that the time series do not contain an added deterministic periodic component of unspecified frequency . \n the autocorrelation function of the time series @xmath90 ( the lower curve in figure [ f3 ] ) has only one statistically significant peak for @xmath98 months ( 480 days ) and negative values for @xmath99 $ ] months ( [ 90 , 390 ] days ) . \n however , the periodogram of this time series ( the upper curve in figure [ f3 ] ) has two significant peaks the first at 15.2 and the second at 5.3 months ( 456 , 159 days ) . \n thus , the periodogram contains the significant peak , although the autocorrelation function has the negative value at @xmath100 months .    to explain \n these problems two following time series of daily sunspot areas are considered : + @xmath101 \n + @xmath102     + where @xmath103    the values @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 are calculated using additional daily data from the solar cycles 15 and 17 .     and the cosine function for @xmath45 ( the period at about 154 days ) . \n the horizontal line ( dotted line ) shows the zero level . \n the vertical dotted lines evaluate the intervals where the sets @xmath107 ( for @xmath108 ) are searched . \n the percentage values show the index @xmath65 for each @xmath41 for the time series @xmath102 ( in parentheses for the time series @xmath101 ) . in the right bottom corner \n the values of @xmath65 for the time series @xmath102 , for @xmath109 are written . ] \n ( the 500-day period ) ]    the comparison of the functions @xmath25 of the time series @xmath101 ( the lower curve in figure [ f4 ] ) and @xmath102 ( the lower curve in figure [ f5 ] ) suggests that the positive values of the function @xmath110 of the time series @xmath101 in the interval of @xmath111 $ ] days could be caused by the 11-year cycle . \n this effect is not visible in the case of periodograms of the both time series computed using the fft method ( see the upper curves in figures [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] ) or the bt method ( see the lower curve in figure [ f6 ] ) . moreover , the periodogram of the time series @xmath102 has the significant values at @xmath112 days , but the autocorrelation function is negative at these points . \n @xcite showed that the lomb - scargle periodograms for the both time series ( see @xcite , figures 7 a - c ) have a peak at 158.8 days which stands over the fap level by a significant amount . using the de method the above discrepancies are obvious . to establish the @xmath79 value the periodograms computed by the fft and \n the bt methods are shown in figure [ f6 ] ( the upper and the lower curve respectively ) . \n for @xmath46 and for periods less than 166 days there is a good comformity of the both periodograms ( but for periods greater than 166 days the points of the bt periodogram are not linked because the bt periodogram has much worse resolution than the fft periodogram ( no one know how to do it ) ) . for @xmath46 and @xmath113 \n the value of @xmath21 is 13 ( @xmath71=153 $ ] ) . \n the inequality ( 7 ) is satisfied because @xmath114 . \n this means that the value of @xmath115 is mainly created by positive values of the autocorrelation function . \n the implication ( 8) needs an evaluation of the greatest value of the index @xmath65 where @xmath70 , but the solar data contain the most prominent period for @xmath116 days because of the solar rotation . \n thus , although @xmath117 for each @xmath118 , all sets @xmath41 ( see ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ) without the set @xmath119 ( see ( 4 ) ) , which contains @xmath120 $ ] , are considered . this situation is presented in figure [ f7 ] . in this figure \n two curves @xmath121 and @xmath122 are plotted . \n the vertical dotted lines evaluate the intervals where the sets @xmath107 ( for @xmath123 ) are searched . for such @xmath41 two numbers \n are written : in parentheses the value of @xmath65 for the time series @xmath101 and above it the value of @xmath65 for the time series @xmath102 . to make this figure clear the curves are plotted for the set @xmath124 only . \n ( in the right bottom corner information about the values of @xmath65 for the time series @xmath102 , for @xmath109 are written . ) \n the implication ( 8) is not true , because @xmath125 for @xmath126 . \n therefore , @xmath43=153\\notin c_6=[423,500]$ ] . \n moreover , the autocorrelation function for @xmath127 $ ] is negative and the set @xmath128 is empty . \n thus , @xmath129 . on the basis of these information one can state , that the periodogram peak at @xmath130 days of the time series @xmath102 exists because of positive @xmath25 , but for @xmath23 from the intervals which do not contain this period . \n looking at the values of @xmath65 of the time series @xmath101 , one can notice that they decrease when @xmath23 increases until @xmath131 . \n this indicates , that when @xmath23 increases , the contribution of the 11-year cycle to the peaks of the periodogram decreases . \n an increase of the value of @xmath65 is for @xmath132 for the both time series , although the contribution of the 11-year cycle for the time series @xmath101 is insignificant . \n thus , this part of the autocorrelation function ( @xmath133 for the time series @xmath102 ) influences the @xmath21-th peak of the periodogram . \n this suggests that the periodicity at about 155 days is a harmonic of the periodicity from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] days . \n ( solid line ) and consecutively smoothed sunspot areas of the one rotation time interval @xmath134 ( dotted line ) . \n both indexes are presented on the left axis . \n the lower curve illustrates fluctuations of the sunspot areas @xmath135 . \n the dotted and dashed horizontal lines represent levels zero and @xmath136 respectively . \n the fluctuations are shown on the right axis . ] \n the described reasoning can be carried out for other values of the periodogram . \n for example , the condition ( 8) is not satisfied for @xmath137 ( 250 , 222 , 200 days ) . \n moreover , the autocorrelation function at these points is negative . \n these suggest that there are not a true periodicity in the interval of [ 200 , 250 ] days . \n it is difficult to decide about the existence of the periodicities for @xmath138 ( 333 days ) and @xmath139 ( 286 days ) on the basis of above analysis . the implication ( 8) is not satisfied for @xmath139 and the condition ( 7 ) is not satisfied for @xmath138 , although the function @xmath25 of the time series @xmath102 is significantly positive for @xmath140 . \n the conditions ( 7 ) and ( 8) are satisfied for @xmath141 ( figure [ f8 ] ) and @xmath142 . therefore , it is possible to exist the periodicity from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] days . \n similar results were also obtained by @xcite for daily sunspot numbers and daily sunspot areas . \n she considered the means of three periodograms of these indexes for data from @xmath143 years and found statistically significant peaks from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] ( see @xcite , figure 2 ) . \n @xcite studied sunspot areas from 1876 - 1999 and sunspot numbers from 1749 - 2001 with the help of the wavelet transform . \n they pointed out that the 154 - 158-day period could be the third harmonic of the 1.3-year ( 475-day ) period . \n moreover , the both periods fluctuate considerably with time , being stronger during stronger sunspot cycles . \n therefore , the wavelet analysis suggests a common origin of the both periodicities . this conclusion confirms the de method result which indicates that the periodogram peak at @xmath144 days is an alias of the periodicity from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] \n in order to verify the existence of the periodicity at about 155 days i consider the following time series : + @xmath145     + @xmath146 \n + @xmath147 \n + the value @xmath134 is calculated analogously to @xmath83 ( see sect . \n the values @xmath148 and @xmath149 are evaluated from the formula ( 9 ) . in the upper part of figure [ f9 ] the time series of sunspot areas @xmath150 of the one rotation time interval from the whole solar disk and the time series of consecutively smoothed sunspot areas @xmath151 \n are showed . in the lower part of figure [ f9 ] \n the time series of sunspot area fluctuations @xmath145 is presented . \n on the basis of these data the maximum activity period of cycle 16 is evaluated . \n it is an interval between two strongest fluctuations e.a . \n @xmath152 $ ] rotations . \n the length of the time interval @xmath153 is 54 rotations . \n if the about @xmath0-day ( 6 solar rotations ) periodicity existed in this time interval and it was characteristic for strong fluctuations from this time interval , 10 local maxima in the set of @xmath154 would be seen . \n then it should be necessary to find such a value of p for which @xmath155 for @xmath156 and the number of the local maxima of these values is 10 . \n as it can be seen in the lower part of figure [ f9 ] this is for the case of @xmath157 ( in this figure the dashed horizontal line is the level of @xmath158 ) . \n figure [ f10 ] presents nine time distances among the successive fluctuation local maxima and the horizontal line represents the 6-rotation periodicity . \n it is immediately apparent that the dispersion of these points is 10 and it is difficult to find even few points which oscillate around the value of 6 . \n such an analysis was carried out for smaller and larger @xmath136 and the results were similar . \n therefore , the fact , that the about @xmath0-day periodicity exists in the time series of sunspot area fluctuations during the maximum activity period is questionable .    . \n the horizontal line represents the 6-rotation ( 162-day ) period . ]    ]    ]    to verify again the existence of the about @xmath0-day periodicity during the maximum activity period in each solar hemisphere separately , the time series @xmath88 and @xmath89 were also cut down to the maximum activity period ( january 1925december 1930 ) . \n the comparison of the autocorrelation functions of these time series with the appriopriate autocorrelation functions of the time series @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are computed for the whole 11-year cycle ( the lower curves of figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) , indicates that there are not significant differences between them especially for @xmath23=5 and 6 rotations ( 135 and 162 days ) ) . \n this conclusion is confirmed by the analysis of the time series @xmath146 for the maximum activity period . \n the autocorrelation function ( the lower curve of figure [ f11 ] ) is negative for the interval of [ 57 , 173 ] days , but the resolution of the periodogram is too low to find the significant peak at @xmath159 days . \n the autocorrelation function gives the same result as for daily sunspot area fluctuations from the whole solar disk ( @xmath160 ) ( see also the lower curve of figures [ f5 ] ) . in the case of \n the time series @xmath89 @xmath161 is zero for the fluctuations from the whole solar cycle and it is almost zero ( @xmath162 ) for the fluctuations from the maximum activity period . \n the value @xmath163 is negative . \n similarly to the case of the northern hemisphere the autocorrelation function and the periodogram of southern hemisphere daily sunspot area fluctuations from the maximum activity period @xmath147 are computed ( see figure [ f12 ] ) . \n the autocorrelation function has the statistically significant positive peak in the interval of [ 155 , 165 ] days , but the periodogram has too low resolution to decide about the possible periodicities . \n the correlative analysis indicates that there are positive fluctuations with time distances about @xmath0 days in the maximum activity period . \n the results of the analyses of the time series of sunspot area fluctuations from the maximum activity period are contradict with the conclusions of @xcite . \n she uses the power spectrum analysis only . \n the periodogram of daily sunspot fluctuations contains peaks , which could be harmonics or subharmonics of the true periodicities . \n they could be treated as real periodicities . \n this effect is not visible for sunspot data of the one rotation time interval , but averaging could lose true periodicities . \n this is observed for data from the southern hemisphere . \n there is the about @xmath0-day peak in the autocorrelation function of daily fluctuations , but the correlation for data of the one rotation interval is almost zero or negative at the points @xmath164 and 6 rotations . \n thus , it is reasonable to research both time series together using the correlative and the power spectrum analyses . \n the following results are obtained :    1 . \n a new method of the detection of statistically significant peaks of the periodograms enables one to identify aliases in the periodogram . \n 2 .   two effects cause the existence of the peak of the periodogram of the time series of sunspot area fluctuations at about @xmath0 days : the first is caused by the 27-day periodicity , which probably creates the 162-day periodicity ( it is a subharmonic frequency of the 27-day periodicity ) and the second is caused by statistically significant positive values of the autocorrelation function from the intervals of @xmath165 $ ] and @xmath166 $ ] days . \n the existence of the periodicity of about @xmath0 days of the time series of sunspot area fluctuations and sunspot area fluctuations from the northern hemisphere during the maximum activity period is questionable . \n the autocorrelation analysis of the time series of sunspot area fluctuations from the southern hemisphere indicates that the periodicity of about 155 days exists during the maximum activity period . \n i appreciate valuable comments from professor j. jakimiec .",
        "abstract": "The study investigates short-term periodicities in sunspot area fluctuations between 1923 and 1933. A 155-day periodicity is identified, often considered a harmonic of longer cycles. Analysis reveals this periodicity in the southern hemisphere during solar cycle 16’s peak activity, but not consistently in the northern hemisphere. A new diagnostic method addresses echo effects in power spectrum analysis, highlighting challenges in confirming true periodicities. These findings emphasize the complexity of short-term solar activity patterns and the importance of careful statistical analysis."

correlation formalism has been generalized to deal with anisotropy in the sgwb @xcite . \n result of this work enables us to consider arbitrary levels of anisotropy , and a bayesian approach was performed by using this formalism @xcite . on the other hand , for the anisotropy of the sgwb , the cross - correlation formalism has been also developed in the case of interferometer detectors  @xcite . \n as to the polarization , there are works including the ones motivated by the modified gravity  @xcite \n . we can envisage supermassive black hole binaries emit circularly polarized sgwb due to the chern - simons term  @xcite . \n there may also exist cosmological sgwb with circular polarization in the presence of parity violating term in gravity sector  @xcite .    in this paper \n , we investigate the detectability of circular polarization in the sgwb by ptas . \n we characterize sgwb by the so called stokes @xmath2 parameter  @xcite and calculate generalized overlap reduction functions ( orfs ) so that we can probe the circular polarization of the sgwb . \n we also discuss a method to separate the intensity ( @xmath3 mode ) and circular polarization ( @xmath2 mode ) of the sgwb . \n the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : \n stokes parameters for a plane gravitational wave ] , we introduce the stokes parameters for monochromatic plane gravitational waves , and clarify the physical meaning of the stokes parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in section [ sec : formulation ] , we formulate the cross - correlation formalism for anisotropic circularly polarized sgwb with ptas . \n the basic framework is essentially a combination of the formalism of @xcite , and the polarization decomposition formula of the sgwb derived in @xcite . in section [ sec : the generalized overlap reduction function for circular polarization ] , we calculate the generalized orfs for the @xmath2 mode . \n the results for @xmath3 mode are consistent with the previous work  @xcite . in section [ sec : separation method ] , we give a method for separation between the @xmath3 mode and @xmath2 mode of the sgwb . \n the final section is devoted to the conclusion . in appendixes , we present analytic results for the generalized overlap reduction functions . in this paper \n , we will use the gravitational units @xmath4 . \n let us consider the stokes parameters for plane waves traveling in the direction @xmath5 , which can be described by @xmath6 \\ \n , \\\\ & & h_{xy}(t , z)=h_{yx}(t , z)={\\rm re}[b_{\\times}\\mathrm{e}^{-iw(t - z ) } ] \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for an idealized monochromatic plane wave , complex amplitudes @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constants . \n polarization of the plane gws is characterized by the tensor , ( see @xcite and also electromagnetic case @xcite ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 take @xmath11 . \n any @xmath12 hermitian matrix can be expanded by the pauli and the unit matrices with real coefficients . \n hence , the @xmath13 hermitian matrix @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 by analogy with electromagnetic cases , @xmath17 and @xmath2 are called stokes parameters . comparing with , we can read off the stokes parameters as @xmath18= b_{+}^{\\ast}b_{\\times}+ b_{\\times}^{\\ast}b_{+},\\\\ v&=&-2{\\rm i m } [ b_{+}^{\\ast}b_{\\times}]=i ( b_{+}^{\\ast}b_{\\times}- b_{\\times}^{\\ast}b_{+}).\\label{stv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apparently , the real parameter @xmath3 is the intensity of gws . in order to reveal the physical meaning of the real parameter @xmath2 , we define the circular polarization bases @xcite @xmath19 from the relation @xmath20 we see @xmath21 \n thus , we can rewrite the stokes parameters - as @xmath22 from the above expression , we see that the real parameter @xmath2 characterizes the asymmetry of circular polarization amplitudes . \n the other parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 have additional information about linear polarizations by analogy with the electromagnetic cases . \n alternatively , we can also define the tensor @xmath25 in circular polarization bases @xmath26 where @xmath27 . \n note that the stokes parameters satisfy a relation @xmath28    next , we consider the transformation of the stokes parameters under rotations around the @xmath5 axis . the rotation around the @xmath5 axis is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angle of the rotation . \n the gws traveling in the direction @xmath5 @xmath31 transform as @xmath32 where we took the transverse traceless gauge @xmath33 after a short calculation , we obtain @xmath34 using and , the four stokes parameters ( [ sti])-([stv ] ) transform as @xmath35 as you can see , the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 depend on the rotation angle @xmath30 . \n this reflects the fact that @xmath23 and @xmath24 parameters characterize linear polarizations . \n note that this transformation is similar to the transformation of electromagnetic case except for the angle @xmath36 and can be rewritten as @xmath37 \n in this section , we study anisotropic distribution of sgwb and focus on the detectability of circular polarizations with pulsar timing arrays . \n we combine the analysis of @xcite and that of @xcite . in sec.[subsec : the spectral ] , we derive the power spectral density for anisotropic circularly polarized sgwb @xmath38 . \n then we also derive the dimensionless density parameter @xmath39 which is expressed by the frequency spectrum of intensity @xmath40  @xcite . in sec.[subsec : the signal ] , we extend the generalized orfs to cases with circular polarizations characterized by the parameter @xmath2 . for simplicity , \n we consider specific anisotropic patterns with @xmath41 expressed by the spherical harmonics @xmath42 .      in the transverse traceless gauge , metric perturbations @xmath43 with a given propagation direction @xmath44 \n can be expanded as @xcite @xmath45 where the fourier amplitude satisfies @xmath46 as a consequence of the reality of @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the frequency of the gws , @xmath49 are spatial indices , @xmath50 label polarizations . \n note that the fourier amplitude @xmath51 satisfies the relation @xmath52 where @xmath53 was defined by . \n the polarized tensors @xmath54 are defined by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are unit orthogonal vectors perpendicular to @xmath58 . \n the polarization tensors satisfy @xmath59 with polar coordinates , the direction @xmath44 can be represented by @xmath60 and the polarization basis vectors read @xmath61    we assume the fourier amplitudes @xmath62 are random variables , which is stationary and gaussian . \n however , they are not isotropic and unpolarized . \n the ensemble average of fourier amplitudes can be written as @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 here , the bracket @xmath65 represents an ensemble average , and @xmath66 is the dirac delta function on the two - sphere . \n the gw power spectral density @xmath38 is a hermitian matrix , and satisfies @xmath67 because of the relation @xmath46 . \n therefore , we have the relations @xmath68 note that the stokes parameters are not exactly the same as the expression of , but they have the relation and characterize the same polarization . \n we further assume that the sgwbs satisfy @xmath69 we also assume the directional dependence of the sgwb is frequency independent @xcite . \n this implies the gw power spectral density is factorized into two parts , one of which depends on the direction while the other depends on the frequency . \n because of the transformations - , the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 have spin 0 and the parameters @xmath70 have spin @xmath71  @xcite . to analyze the sgwb on the sky , it is convenient to expand the stokes parameters by spherical harmonics @xmath72 \n . however , since @xmath70 parameters have spin @xmath71 , they have to be expanded by the spin - weighted harmonics @xmath73 @xcite . \n thus , we obtain @xmath74 in this paper , we study specific anisotropic patterns with @xmath41 for simplicity . \n therefore , we can neglect @xmath23 and @xmath24 from now on . \n thus , the gw power spectral density becomes @xmath75 where @xmath76 so , we focus on the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in what follows , we will use the following shorthand notation @xmath77    next , we consider the dimensionless density parameter  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the critical density , @xmath80 is the present value of the hubble parameter , @xmath81 is the energy density of gravitational waves , and @xmath82 is the energy density in the frequency range @xmath48 to @xmath83 . \n the bracket @xmath65 represents the ensemble average . \n however , actually , we take a spatial average over the wave lengths @xmath84 of gws or a temporal average over the periods @xmath85 of gws . here \n , we assumed the ergodicity , namely , the ensemble average can be replaced by the temporal average . \n using , , , as well as @xmath46 and @xmath86 , we get @xmath87 then we define @xmath88 hence , the dimensionless quantity @xmath39 in is given by @xmath89 where the spherical harmonics are orthogonal and normalized as @xmath90 using @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 without loss of generality , we normalize the monopole moment as @xmath93 so , becomes @xmath94      the time of arrival of radio pulses from the pulsar is affected by gws . \n consider a pulsar with frequency @xmath95 located in the direction @xmath96 . to detect the sgwb , \n let us consider the redshift of the pulse from a pulsar @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a frequency detected at the earth and @xmath96 is the direction to the pulsar . \n the unit vector @xmath44 represents the direction of propagation of gravitational plane waves . \n we also defined the difference between the metric perturbations at the pulsar @xmath99 and at the earth @xmath100 as @xmath101 the gravitational plane waves at each point is defined as @xmath102 for the sgwb , the redshift have to be integrated over the direction of propagation of the gravitational waves @xmath44 : @xmath103 we choose a coordinate system @xmath104 and assume that the amplitudes of the metric perturbation at the pulsar and the earth are the same . \n then becomes @xmath105 and therefore , reads @xmath106 where we have defined the pattern functions for pulsars @xmath107 note that our convention for the fourier transformation is @xmath108 therefore , the fourier transformation of can be written as @xmath109    in the actual signals from a pulsar , there exist noises . \n hence , we need to use the correlation analysis . \n we consider the signals from two pulsars @xmath110 where @xmath111 labels the pulsar . here \n , @xmath112 denotes the signal from the pulsar and @xmath113 denotes the noise intrinsic to the measurement . \n we assume the noises are stationary , gaussian and are not correlated between the two pulsars . \n to correlate the signals of two measurements , we define @xmath114 where @xmath1 is the total observation time and @xmath115 is a real filter function which should be optimal to maximize signal - to - noise ratio . in the case of interferometer \n , the optimal filter function falls to zero for large @xmath116 compered to the travel time of the light between the detecters . \n since the signals of two detectors are expected to correlate due to the same effect of the gravitational waves , the optimal filter function should behave this way . \n then , typically one of the detectors is very close to the other compared to the total observation time @xmath1 . \n therefore , the total observation time @xmath1 can be extended to @xmath117 @xcite . \n in contrast , in the case of pta , it is invalid that @xmath1 is very large compered to the travel time of the light between the pulsars . \n nevertheless , we can assume that one of the two @xmath1 can be expanded to @xmath117 , because in situations @xmath118 and @xmath119 it is known that we can ignore the effect of the distance @xmath120 of pulsars . \n in this case , it is clear that any locations of the pulsars are optimal and optimal filter function should behave like as the interferometer case @xcite .    using these assumptions @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we can rewrite as @xmath121 where @xmath122 note that @xmath123 satisfies @xmath124 , because @xmath125 is real . \n moreover , to deal with the unphysical region @xmath126 we require @xmath127 . \n thus , @xmath123 becomes real . \n taking the ensemble average , using @xmath128 , @xmath118 , and assuming the noises in the two measurements are not correlated , we get @xmath129\\ , \\label{s2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath130 the functions @xmath131 and @xmath132 are called the generalized orfs , which describe the angular sensitivity of the pulsars for the sgwb . note that , as we already mentioned , we consider the cases of @xmath41 for simplicity \n . then we have assumed @xmath118 and @xmath119 , this assumption implies that approximately becomes @xmath133 due to the rapid oscillation of the phase factor . \n therefore , the distance @xmath120 of the pulsars does not appear in the generalized orfs , and hence the generalized orfs do not depend on the frequency .    as you can see from , \n the correlation of the two measurements involve both the total intensity and the circular polarization . \n however , the degeneracy can be disentangled by using separation method , which will be discussed in the section [ sec : separation method ] . \n in this section , we consider the generalized orfs for circular polarizations : @xmath134 where we defined @xmath135 in the above , we have used and the fact that the generalized orfs do not depend on frequency . for computation of the generalized orfs for circular polarizations , \n it is convenient to use the computational frame @xcite defined by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the angular separation between the two pulsars . using - , , and \n , one can easily show that @xmath138 we therefore get @xmath139 the explicit form of the spherical harmonics reads @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the normalization factor . \n the associated legendre functions are given by @xmath142 and @xmath143 with the legendre functions @xmath144\\ .\\label{pl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the spherical harmonics , becomes @xmath145 where we have used the fact that the function of @xmath146 is odd parity in the case of @xmath147 and is even parity in the case of @xmath148 . \n note that the generalized orfs for circular polarizations are real functions . in the case of @xmath149 and/or @xmath150 , \n the integrand in vanishes . \n therefore , we can not detect circular polarizations for these cases . \n this fact for @xmath151 implies that we do not need to consider auto - correlation for a single pulsar . \n this is the reason why we neglected auto - correlation term in .    integrating , \n we get the following form for @xmath152 : @xmath153 for @xmath154 , we have obtained @xmath155 \\ , \\\\ \\gamma^{v}_{1 -

assumed for the analysis . \n recently , however , a stochastic gravitational wave background with anisotropy have been considered . \n the information of the anisotropic pattern of the distribution should contain important information of the sources such as supermassive black hole binaries and the sources in the early universe . \n it is also intriguing to take into account the polarization of sgwb in the pta analysis . \n therefore , we extended the correlation analysis to circularly polarized sgwb and calculated generalized overlap reduction functions for them . \n it turned out that the circular polarization can not be detected for an isotropic background . \n however , when the distribution has anisotropy , we have shown that there is a chance to observe circular polarizations in the sgwb . \n we also discussed how to separate polarized modes from unpolarized modes of gravitational waves . \n if we have a priori knowledge of the abundance ratio for each mode in each of

        "abstract": "This study examines the potential to detect circular polarization in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). While circular polarization cannot be observed in an isotropic SGWB, it becomes detectable if the background is anisotropic. The paper introduces generalized overlap reduction functions for analyzing circular polarization and presents methods to distinguish polarized waves from unpolarized ones. This research could offer insights into sources like supermassive black hole binaries, cosmic strings, and early-universe inflation."

        "abstract": "A new barrier penetration formula, derived from the WKB approximation, accounts for the long-range Coulomb interaction, making it effective for low-energy penetrations below the Coulomb barrier. The formula provides accurate penetrability calculations and closely matches WKB results. Applied to alpha-decay half-life evaluations for atomic nuclei, it demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data, particularly for spherical nuclei. This formula enhances the study of barrier penetrability in nuclear processes and fusion reactions."

        "article": "for the hybrid monte carlo algorithm ( hmc)@xcite , often used to study quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) on the lattice , one is interested in efficient numerical time integration schemes which are optimal in terms of computational costs per trajectory for a given acceptance rate . high order \n numerical methods allow the use of larger step sizes , but demand a larger computational effort per step ; low order schemes do not require such large computational costs per step , but need more steps per trajectory . \n so there is a need to balance these opposing effects . \n omelyan integration schemes @xcite of a force - gradient type have proved to be an efficient choice , since it is easy to obtain higher order schemes that demand a small additional computational effort . \n these schemes use higher - order information from force - gradient terms to both increase the convergence of the method and decrease the size of the leading error coefficient . other ideas to achieve better efficiency for numerical time integrators are given by multirate or nested approaches . \n these schemes do not increase the order but reduce the computational costs per path by recognizing the different dynamical time - scales generated by different parts of the action . \n slow forces , which are usually expensive to evaluate , need only to be sampled at low frequency while fast forces which are usually cheap to evaluate need to be sampled at a high frequency . a natural way to inherit the advantages from both force - gradient type schemes and multirate approaches would be to combine these two ideas .    previously , we studied the behavior of the adapted nested force - gradient scheme for the example of the @xmath0-body problem @xcite and would like to learn more about their usefulness for lattice field theory calculations . due to the huge computational effort required for qcd simulations , \n it is natural to attempt an intermediate step first . \n we chose the model problem of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in two dimensions , the schwinger model @xcite , since it is well - suited as a test case for new concepts and ideas which can be subsequently applied to more computationally demanding problems @xcite . \n as a lattice quantum field theory , it has many of the properties of more sophisticated models such as qcd , for example the numerical cost is still dominated by the fermion part of the action . the fact that this model , with far fewer degrees of freedom , does not require such large computational effort makes it the perfect choice for testing purposes . \n we compare the behavior of numerical time integration schemes currently used for hmc @xcite with the nested force - gradient integrator @xcite and the adapted version introduced in @xcite . \n we investigate the computational costs needed to perform numerical calculations , as well as the effort required to achieve a satisfactory acceptance rate during the hmc evolution . \n our goal is to find a numerical scheme for the hmc algorithm which would provide a sufficiently high acceptance rate while not drastically increasing the simulation time . \n the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 \n we give a short overview of the hmc algorithm and numerical schemes for time integration , which are used in hmc . in section 3 \n we present the 2-dimensional schwinger model and introduce the idea of the force - gradient approach and the resulting novel class of numerical schemes . \n section 4 is devoted to the results of a comparison between widely used algorithms and the new approach and section 5 draws our conclusion . \n in this section we provide a general overview of the hmc algorithm @xcite to introduce our novel integrator . \n we also present some standard numerical time integrating methods used in hmc , as well state - of - the - art numerical schemes , which we later compare by applying them to the two - dimensional schwinger model .      in the hybrid monte carlo algorithm , \n the quantum lattice field theory is embedded in a higher - dimensional classical system through the introduction of a fictitious ( simulation ) time @xcite . \n the gauge field @xmath1 is associated with its ( fictitious ) conjugate momenta @xmath2 , and the classical system is described by the hamiltonian , @xmath3 + { \\mathcal{b}}[u],\\ ] ] where @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] represent the kinetic and potential energy respectively .    for a given configuration @xmath1 , \n a new configuration @xmath6 is generated by performing an hmc update @xmath7 , which consists of two steps :    * * molecular dynamics trajectory : * evolve the gauge fields @xmath1 , elements of a lie group , and the momenta @xmath2 , elements of the corresponding lie algebra , in a fictitious computer time @xmath8 according to hamilton s equations of motions @xmath9 since analytical solutions are not available in general , numerical methods must be used to solve the system of eqn .  . \n the discrete updates of @xmath1 and @xmath2 with an integration step @xmath10 are @xmath11 leading to a first - order approximation at time @xmath12 . \n since the momenta @xmath2 are elements of lie algebra , we have an additive update of @xmath2 . \n on the other hand , the links @xmath1 must be elements of the lie group , therefore an exponential update is used for @xmath1 to preserve the underlying group structure . * * metropolis step : * accept or reject the new configuration @xmath13 with probability @xmath14 where @xmath15 .      in this paper \n we are concerned with numerical time integration schemes , which preserve the fundamental properties of geometric integration , time - reversibility and volume - preservation . \n all numerical schemes presented below possess these necessary properties . \n * basic schemes : * well - known , commonly used integration schemes in molecular dynamics are given by    * the leap - frog method , a 3-stage composition scheme of the discrete updates defined above : @xmath16 * and a 5-stage extension widely used in qcd computations : @xmath17    * force gradient schemes : * force - gradient schemes increase accuracy by using additional information from the force gradient term @xmath18 , with @xmath19 defining lie brackets . the 5-stage force - gradient scheme proposed by omelyan et \n al @xcite is the simplest ; @xmath20 here we also test the modification of the force - gradient method proposed in @xcite , where the force - gradient term @xmath21 is approximated via a taylor expansion . \n an extension is given by the 11-stage decomposition @xcite , recently implemented as the integrator in the open source code openqcd as one of the standard options @xcite \n @xmath22where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are parameters from equation ( 71 ) in ref . \n @xcite .    * \n nested schemes : * qed and qcd problems usually lead to hamiltonians with the following fine structure @xmath27 + { \\mathcal{b}}_{1}[u]+ { \\mathcal{b}}_{2}[u],\\ ] ] where the action of the system can be split into two parts : a fast action @xmath28 such as the gauge action , and a slow part @xmath29 , for example , the fermion action . \n this allows us to apply the idea of multirate schemes ( an idea known as nested integration in physics literature)@xcite in order to reduce the computational effort . at \n first we consider the nested version of the leap - frog method @xmath30 where the inner cheaper system @xmath31+{\\mathcal{b}}_{1}[u]$ ] is solved by @xmath32 with @xmath33 being a number of iterations for the fast part of the action . \n our main goal is to compare the above - mentioned methods with more elaborated nested schemes : in @xcite , a similar 5-stage decomposition scheme has been recently introduced : @xmath34    a nested version of , which has been used in  @xcite reads @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in the limit @xmath39 \n we have @xmath40 . \n note that this approach uses force - gradient information at all levels , i.e. , the high computational cost of high order schemes appears at all levels . \n one may overcome this problem by using schemes of different order at the different levels without losing the effective high order of the overall multirate scheme . \n for the latter , we include appropriate force gradient information as we explain in the following for the case of two time levels , where the gauge action plays the role of the fast and cheap part , and the fermionic action plays the role of the slow and expensive part . \n the reasoning is as follows : if one uses the 5-stage sexton - weingarten integrator of second order for the slow action , and approximates the fast action by @xmath41 leap - frog steps of step size @xmath42 , the error of the overall multirate scheme will be of order @xmath43 . with the use of force gradient information only at the slowest level it is possible to cancel the leading error term of order @xmath44 . \n as @xmath45 usually holds in the multirate setting , the overall order is then given by the leading error term of order @xmath46 , i.e. , the scheme has an effective order of four . \n one example for such a scheme for problems of type is given by the 5-stage nested force - gradient scheme introduced in @xcite @xmath47 to summarize , the adapted scheme   differs from the original one   in two perspectives :    * the force gradient scheme for the fast action is replaced by a leap - frog scheme . * \n only the part @xmath48 of the full force gradient @xmath49 is needed to gain the effective order of four . \n the numerical schemes - and - are second order convergent schemes . methods - and - have the fourth order of convergence . \n we do not consider integrators of higher order than four since the computational costs are too high . \n the schemes of the same convergence order differ from each other by the number of stages ( updates of momenta and links per time step ) . \n usually methods with more stages have smaller leading error coefficients and therefore have better accuracy , but higher computational costs . \n we would like to determine which integrator would represent the best compromise between high accuracy and computational efficiency \n .    we will apply all these numerical integration schemes  to the two - dimensional schwinger model . \n the most challenging task from the theoretical point of view is to derive the force - gradient term @xmath21 . in the next section \n we introduce the schwinger model and explain how to obtain the force - gradient term . \n the 2 dimensional schwinger model is defined by the following hamiltonian function @xmath50 = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=1,\\mu=1}^{v,2 } p_{n,\\mu}^2 + s_g[u ] + s_f[u].}\\ ] ] with @xmath51 the volume of the lattice . unlike qcd , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 , for this qed problem , the links @xmath1 are the elements of the lie group @xmath54 and the momenta @xmath55 belong to @xmath56 , which represents the lie algebra of the group @xmath54 . \n this makes this test example very cheap in terms of the computational time . \n this together with the fact that the schwinger model also shares many of the features of qcd simulations , makes the schwinger model an excellent test example when considering numerical integrators : a fast dynamics given by the computationally cheap gauge part @xmath57 $ ] of the action demanding small step sizes , and a slow dynamics given by the computationally expensive fermion part @xmath58 $ ] allowing large step sizes . \n the pure gauge part of the action @xmath59 sums up over all plaquettes @xmath60 in the two - dimensional lattice with @xmath61 and is given by @xmath62 the links @xmath1 can be written in the form @xmath63 and connect the sites @xmath0 and @xmath64 on the lattice ; @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath66 , @xmath67 @xmath68 are respectively space and time directions and @xmath69 is a coupling constant . \n note that from now on we will set the lattice spacing @xmath70 . \n the fermion part of the action @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 where @xmath26 is a complex pseudofermion field . here , @xmath73 denotes the wilson  dirac operator given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the pauli matrices @xmath76 @xmath77 is the mass parameter and the kronecker delta @xmath78 acts on the pseudofermion field by @xmath79 with @xmath80 the pseudofermion field , a vector in the two - dimensional spinor space taking values at each lattice point @xmath0 . in order to proceed with the numerical integration we need to obtain the force @xmath81 and the force gradient term @xmath21 . \n the force term @xmath82 with respect to the link @xmath83 is given by the first derivative of the action @xmath84 and can be written as @xmath85 since the numerical schemes  use the multi - rate approach , the shifts in the momenta updates are split on @xmath86 and @xmath87 and we can consider them separately . \n the force terms @xmath86 and @xmath87 are obtained by differentiation over @xmath54 group elements , which for the schwinger model is the standard differentiation .    the force associated with link @xmath88 from the gauge action \n is given by @xmath89 the force term of the fermion part is given by @xmath90 \\,\\ ] ] where vectors @xmath91 and @xmath92 are given @xmath93    for the numerical methods and we need to find the force gradient term @xmath94 with respect to the link @xmath83 . in case of the schwinger model this term reads @xmath95    for simplicity we decompose the force gradient term in four parts @xmath96 this decomposition is also useful since the numerical integrator only uses the term @xmath97 by construction . \n as shown in @xcite , to obtain the fourth order convergent scheme from the second order convergent method we must eliminate the leading error term , which is exactly represented by @xmath97 . for completeness we discuss all 4 parts below . \n the @xmath98 part of the force - gradient term is @xmath99 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the set of plaquettes @xmath100 then by using the vectors @xmath101 defined in we obtain the @xmath102 piece of the force - gradient term given by @xmath103 . } \n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second derivative of the fermion action is @xmath104 \\xi + } \\nonumber \\\\ & & { 2 \\operatorname{re } \\chi^\\dagger \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial q_\\mu(n ) } ( d^\\dagger d)^{-1 } \\frac{\\partial d^\\dagger}{\\partial q_\\nu(m ) } \\chi \\ , , } \\nonumber \\\\ & & { = 2 \\operatorname{re } \\left [ z_{1,m,\\nu}^\\dagger \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial q_{\\mu}(n ) } \\xi +   \\chi^\\dagger \n \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial q_{\\mu}(n ) } d^{-1 } w_{2,m,\\nu } -

gradient term @xmath21 requires 4 more inversions . \n therefore leap - frog based methods and need 4 computations of @xmath121 per time step ; schemes and 6 times ; force - gradient based methods 8 for and , 10 for and the 11 stage method has 12 inversions of the dirac operator . since we use the multi - rate approach for schemes , and , which leads generally to fewer macro time steps needed than for the standard schemes we expect the integrator will be the most efficient choice among the methods considered . in the next section we present numerical tests of this prediction . \n in this section we apply the numerical integrators  to compute the molecular dynamics step for the schwinger model when studied with the hmc algorithm . \n we consider a @xmath122 by @xmath122 lattice with a coupling constant @xmath123 and mass @xmath124 . \n the parameters were taken from @xcite and correspond to the scaling variable @xmath125 defined in @xcite.we have chosen them to simulate close to the scaling limit with light fermions and also to increase the impact of the fermion part of the action . \n we use one thermalised gauge configuration . for each integrator and value of the step - size \n we generate @xmath126 independent sets of momenta and integrate the equations of motion on a trajectory of length @xmath127 . \n we compute the absolute error @xmath128 and estimate its statistical error from the standard deviation . \n also the parameter @xmath33 is chosen in such a way to make micro step size to be @xmath129 times smaller than the macro step size @xmath10 . \n figure [ fig:1 ] presents the comparison between the numerical integrators  . \n it shows the absolute error @xmath128 versus the step -

gradient method and adapted nested force- gradient method show much better results in terms of a computational efficiency than the integrators and ; and even compared to the 11 stage scheme . \n here we can see that the modification of proposed in @xcite also performs better than its original version . \n it shows almost similar computational costs as nested versions of the force - gradient approach - , since it has the same number of @xmath121  ( see table [ tab:1 ] ) . \n but it is less efficient because the proposed nested approach is more precise . \n .step - sizes and number of inversions of @xmath73 per step and per trajectory for acceptance rate of 90% [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tab:1 ] shows the number of inversions of the dirac operator @xmath73 , which is needed to reach 90% acceptance rate of the hmc . since @xmath121 is the most computationally demanding part it is important to see how many of these inversions are required per each trajectory . from table \n [ tab:1 ] it easy to see that the adapted nested force - gradient method and nested force - gradient method need the least number of @xmath121 per trajectory to reach the chosen acceptance rate @xmath130 . \n we can also claim that methods and have a potential to perform even better with respect to the computational effort in the case of lattice qcd problems , since the impact of the fermion action and the computational time to obtain the inversion of the dirac operator @xmath73 is much more significant . \n we presented the nested force - gradient approach and its adapted version applied to a model problem in quantum field theory , the two - dimensional schwinger model . \n the derivation of the force - gradient terms was given and the schwinger model was introduced . \n nested force - gradient schemes seem to be an optimal choice with relatively high convergence order and low computational effort . \n also it would be possible to improve the algorithm by measuring the poisson brackets of the shadow hamiltonian of the proposed integrator and then tuning the set of optimal parameters , e.  g. micro and macro step sizes . \n + in future work we will apply this approach to the hmc algorithm for numerical integration in lattice qcd . here \n we expect the adapted nested - force gradient scheme to outperform the original one , if we further partition the action into more than two parts , by using techniques to factorize the fermion determinant : less force - gradient information is needed for the most expensive action , and only leap -

        "abstract": "This study introduces adapted nested force-gradient integrators for the molecular dynamics step in the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. Tested on the 2D Schwinger model, these methods combine force-gradient schemes and multirate integration to optimize efficiency. The approach reduces computational costs while maintaining high acceptance rates compared to traditional methods. By balancing step sizes for fast and slow forces, these integrators improve accuracy and performance, offering promising applications for more complex lattice QCD simulations."

        "article": "the short - lived radioisotope ( slri ) @xmath4al was alive during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula , the ca- , al - rich inclusions ( cais ) found in primitive chondritic meteorites . \n this means that at least some of the solar system s slris may have been injected into either the presolar cloud ( e.g. , boss & keiser 2012 ; boss 2012 ) or the solar nebula ( ouellette et al . 2007 , 2010 ; dauphas & chaussidon 2011 ) by a supernova or agb star shock wave . in either case , \n injection occurred as a single event that was spatially heterogeneous , which would potentially reduce the usefulness of @xmath4al as a spatially homogeneous chronometer ( dauphas & chaussidon 2011 ) for precise studies of the earliest phases of planet formation ( macpherson et al . \n 2012 ; cf . \n krot et al . \n previous models ( e.g. , boss 2011 , 2012 ) have shown how such initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity can be substantially reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable ( mgu ) disk , as a result of the large - scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and particles small enough to move with the gas ( e.g. , boss et al . \n 2012 ) . other elements and their isotopes suggest a similarly well - mixed solar nebula ( e.g. , os : walker 2012 ; fe : \n wang et al . 2013 ) . \n the stable oxygen isotopes , on the other hand , appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the solar nebula during the early phases of planet formation ; e.g. , small refractory particles from comet 81p / wild 2 have normalized @xmath5o/@xmath6o ratios that span the entire solar system range of @xmath0 6% variations ( nakashima et al . 2012 ) . \n the leading explanation for generating these oxygen anomalies is uv photodissociation of co molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula ( e.g. , podio et al . \n 2013 ) , where self - shielding could lead to isotopic fractionation between gas - phase and solid - phase oxygen atoms ( e.g. , lyons & young 2005 ; krot et al . \n co self - shielding on the irregular , corrugated outer surface of the disk would also lead to initial spatial heterogeneity , though the process would be continuous in time , rather than a single - shot event like a supernova shock wave . \n furthermore , the very existence of refractory particles in comet 81p / wild 2 ( brownlee et al . 2006 ; simon et al . 2008 ; nakamura et al . \n 2008 ) , which are thought to have formed close to the protosun , implies that these small particles experienced large - scale outward transport from the inner solar nebula to the comet - forming regions of the outer solar nebula . \n mgu disks offer a means to accomplish this early large - scale transport ( e.g. , boss 2008 , 2011 ; boss et al . \n 2012 ) . \n marginally gravitationally unstable disks are likely to be involved in the fu orionis outbursts experienced by young solar - type stars ( e.g. , zhu et al . 2010b ; vorobyov & basu 2010 ; martin et al . \n mgu disk models ( e.g. , boss 2011 ) can easily lead to the high mass accretion rates ( @xmath7 yr@xmath8 ) needed to explain fu orionis events . \n fu orionis outbursts are believed to last for about a hundred years and to occur periodically for all low mass protostars ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 ; miller et al . \n mgu models are also capable of offering an alternative mechanism ( disk instability ) for gas giant planet formation ( e.g. , boss 2010 ; meru & bate 2012 ; basu & vorobyov 2012 ) . \n however , the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) is likely to be involved in fu orionis outbursts as well ( zhu et al . \n 2009a ) , with mri operating in the ionized innermost disk layers as well as at the disk s surfaces . \n zhu et al . ( 2009c , 2010a , b ) have constructed one- and two - dimensional ( axisymmetric ) models of a coupled mgu - mri mechanism , with mgu slowly leading to a build - up of mass in the innermost disk , which then triggers a rapid mri instability and an outburst . \n alternatively , mri may operate in the outermost disk , partially ionized by cosmic rays , leading to a build - up of mass in the dead zone at the intermediate disk midplane , thus triggering a phase of mgu transport . \n such a coupled mechanism may be crucial for achieving outbursts in t tauri disks , where the disk masses are expected to be smaller than at earlier phases of evolution . \n we present here several new sets of mgu disk models that examine the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced in either the inner or outer solar nebula , by either a single - shot event or a continuous injection process , for a variety of disk and central protostar masses , including protostars with m dwarf masses . \n low mass exoplanets are beginning to be discovered around an increasingly larger fraction of m dwarfs ( bonfils et al . \n 2013 ; dressing & charbonneau 2013 ; kopparapu 2013 ) , with a number of these being potentially habitable exoplanets , elevating the importance of understanding mixing and transport processes in m dwarf disks . \n the numerical models were computed with the same three dimensional , gravitational hydrodynamics code that has been employed in previous mgu disk models ( e.g. , boss 2011 ) . \n complete details about the code and its testing may be found in boss & myhill ( 1992 ) . \n briefly , the code performs second - order - accurate ( in both space and time ) hydrodynamics on a spherical coordinate grid , including radiative transfer in the diffusion approximation . \n a spherical harmonic ( @xmath9 ) expansion of the disk s density distribution is used to compute the self - gravity of the disk , with terms up to and including @xmath10 . \n the radial grid contains 50 grid points for the 10 au disk models and 100 grid points for the 40 au disk models . \n all models have 256 azimuthal grid points , and effectively 45 theta grid points , given the hemispherical symmetry of the grid . \n the theta grid is compressed around the disk s midplane to provide enhanced spatial resolution , while the azimuthal grid is uniformly spaced . \n the jeans length constraint is used to ensure adequate resolution . \n the inner boundary absorbs infalling disk gas , which is added to the central protostar , while the outer disk boundary absorbs the momentum of outward - moving disk gas , while retaining the gas on the active grid . \n the central protostar wobbles in such a manner as to preserve the center of mass of the entire system . \n the time evolution of a color field is calculated ( e.g. , boss 2011 ) in order to follow the mixing and transport of isotopes carried by the disk gas or by small particles , which should move along with the disk gas . \n the equation for the evolution of the color field density @xmath11 ( e.g. , boss 2011 ) is identical to the continuity equation for the disk gas density @xmath12    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the disk gas velocity and @xmath15 is the time . \n the total amount of color is conserved in the same way that the disk mass is conserved , as the hydrodynamic equations are solved in conservation law form ( e.g. , boss & myhill 1992 ) . \n the initial disk density distributions are based on the approximation derived by boss ( 1993 ) for a self - gravitating disk orbiting a star with mass @xmath16    @xmath17 @xmath18,\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are cylindrical coordinates , @xmath21 is the gravitational constant , @xmath22 is the midplane density , @xmath23 is the surface density , @xmath24 ( cgs units ) and @xmath25 . \n the initial midplane density is    @xmath26    while the initial surface density is    @xmath27    the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the reference radius @xmath30 are defined in table 1 for the various disk models explored in this paper . \n the total amount of mass in the models does not change during the evolutions ; the initial infalling disk envelope accretes onto the disk , and no further mass is added to the system across the outer disk boundary at @xmath31 . \n the outer disk surfaces are thus revealed to any potential source of uv irradiation .    for the 10 au outer radius disks listed in tables 2 and 3 , the initial disk temperature profiles \n ( figures 1 and 2 ) are based on the boss ( 1996 ) temperature profiles , with variations in the assumed outer disk temperature @xmath32 , chosen in order to study the effect of varied minimum values of the @xmath2 stability parameter . \n values of @xmath33 indicate marginally gravitationally unstable disks . \n the inner disks are all highly @xmath2 stable , with @xmath34 . \n for the 40 au outer radius disks listed in table 4 , the initial disk temperatures are uniform at the specified outer disk temperature @xmath32 , leading to similar initial @xmath2 values throughout the disks . \n for all of the models , the temperature of the infalling envelope is 50 k.    the initial color field is added to the surface of the initial disk in an azimuthal sector spanning either 45 degrees ( 10 au outer radius disks ) or 90 degrees ( 40 au outer radius disks ) in a narrow ring of width 1 au , centered at the injection radii listed in the tables . \n these models are intended to represent one - time , single - shot injections of isotopic heterogeneity , such as supernova - induced rayleigh - taylor fingers carrying live @xmath4al ( e.g. , boss & keiser 2012 ) . table 4 lists both single - shot and continuous injection models , where in the latter case the color is added continuously to the same location on the disk surface throughout the evolution , crudely simulating ongoing photodissociation of co ( e.g. , lyons & young 2005 ) possibly leading to stable oxygen isotope fractionation between the gas and solid phases . \n the color field in the latter case is intended to represent isotopically distinct gas or small particles resulting from the uv photochemistry . \n note that in both the single - shot and continuous injection models , the total amount of color added is arbitrary ( e.g. , the color field in the injection volume is simply set equal to 1 ) , and is intended to be scaled to whatever value is appropriate for the isotope(s ) under consideration . \n the color field is a massless , passive tracer that has no effect on the disk s dynamics , so the total amount of color added is irrelevant for the disk s subsequent evolution . \n the models seek to follow the deviations from uniformity of the color field , not the absolute amounts of color added ; the evolution of the dispersion of the color field about its mean radial value , divided by the mean radial value at each instant of time , is the goal of these models . \n observations of the dg tau disk by podio et al . \n ( 2013 ) have shown that dg tau itself irradiates its disk s outer layers from 10 au to 90 au with a strong uv flux , sufficient for significant uv photolysis and the formation of observable water vapor . \n much higher levels of uv irradiation can occur for protoplanetary disks that form in stellar clusters containing massive stars ( e.g. , walsh et al . \n 2013 ) , an environment that has been suggested for our own solar system ( e.g. , dauphas & chaussidon 2011 ) in order to explain the evidence for live slris found in primitive meteorites . \n the fact that molecular hydrogen constitutes the great majority of a disk s mass , yet can not be directly detected , except at the star - disk boundary region , means that estimates of disk masses are uncertain at best ( e.g. , andrews & williams 2007 ) , as they are typically based on an assumed ratio between the amount of mm - sized dust grains and the total disk mass . \n isella et al . \n ( 2009 ) estimated that low- and intermediate - mass pre - main - sequence stars form with disk masses ranging from 0.05 to 0.4 @xmath1 . \n dg tau s disk has a mass estimated to be as high as 0.1 @xmath1 ( podio et al . \n recently , the mass of the tw hydra disk was revised upward to at least 0.05 @xmath1 ( bergin et al . \n 2013 ) . these and other observations suggest that the mgu disk masses assumed in these models may be achieved in some fraction of protoplanetary disks , and perhaps in the solar nebula as well . \n in fact , miller et al . ( \n 2011 ) detected a fu orionis outburst in the classical t tauri star lkh@xmath35 188-g4 . \n disk masses are typically thought to be @xmath36 for such stars . \n the fact that a fu orionis event occurred in lkh@xmath35 188-g4 shows that even the disks around class ii - type objects can experience instabilities leading to rapid mass accretion , e.g. , mgu disk phases . \n we present results for a variety of protostellar and protoplanetary disk masses , varied initial minimum @xmath2 stability parameters , and varied injection radii , for disks of two different sizes . \n table 2 shows the initial conditions for the models with a @xmath37 disk in orbit around a @xmath38 protostar . \n the disks extend from 1 au to 10 au , as in the models by boss ( 2008 , 2011 ) . \n the main difference from these previous models is that the disk mass ( @xmath37 ) is considerably lower than that of the previous models ( @xmath39 ) . as a result , \n the initial minimum @xmath2 values are considerably higher than in the previous models , ranging from 2.2 to 3.1 , compared to the previous range of 1.4 to 2.5 . \n the present models are thus less gravitationally unstable initially than the disks previously considered , with the goal being to learn whether or not the previous results will change for higher values of @xmath40 . \n figure 1 displays the initial midplane temperature profiles for these models . \n only the outermost regions of the disks are cool enough to be gravitationally unstable , but the models show that this is sufficient to result in qualitatively similar behavior for all of the table 2 models \n .    figures 3 and 4 show the equatorial plane distribution of the color / gas ratio ( @xmath41 ) for model 1.0 - 2.6 - 9 . \n this ratio is plotted , as it is equivalent to the @xmath4al/@xmath42al and @xmath5o/@xmath6o ratios measured by cosmochemists , i.e. , the abundance of an injected or photolysis product species , divided by that of a species that was prevalent in the pre - injection disk . \n figure 3 shows that the initial disk surface injection at 9 au has resulted in the rapid transport of the color field downward to the disk s midplane , as well as inward to close to the inner disk boundary at 2 au . \n the vigorous three dimensional motions of a mgu disk are responsible for this large - scale transport in just 34 yr . at this time \n , the color / gas ratio is still highly heterogeneous , but figure 4 shows that only 146 yr later , the color / gas ratio has been strongly homogenized throughout the entire disk midplane . \n figure 5 shows the evolution of the dispersion of the ratio of the color density to the gas density for models 1.0 - 2.6 - 9 and 1.0 - 2.6 - 2 at two times . \n these models differ only in the injection radius , either 9 au or 2 au . \n the dispersion plotted in figure 5 is defined to be the square root of the sum of the squares of the color field divided by the gas density , subtracted by the azimuthal average of this ratio at a given orbital radius , divided by the square of the azimuthal average at that radius , normalized by the number of azimuthal grid points , and plotted as a function of radius in the disk midplane . \n figure 5 shows that the isotopic dispersion is a strong function of orbital radius and time , with the dispersion initially being relatively large ( i.e. , at 180 yr , in spite of the apparent homogeneity seen in figure 4 at the same time ) as a result of the isotopes traveling downward and radially inward and outward . \n however , the dispersion decreases dramatically in the outer disks for both models by 777 yr to a value of @xmath0 1% to 2% . \n in fact , the dispersion in both models 1.0 - 2.6 - 9 and 1.0 - 2.6 - 2 evolves toward essentially the same radial distribution by this time , showing that the exact location of the injection location has little effect on the long term evolution of the distribution : that is controlled solely by the evolution of the underlying mgu disk , which is identical for these two models ( i.e. , the color fields are passive tracers , and have no effect on the disk s evolution ) . \n note that any small refractory grains present in the initial disk will be carried along with the disk gas , so that some of the grains that start out at 2 au will be transported to the outermost disk , in the same manner that some of the gas is transported outward . \n most of the gas and dust , however , is accreted by the growing protostar . \n figure 6 shows the results for three models with varied @xmath40 , i.e. , models 1.0 - 2.6 - 9 , 1.0 - 2.9 - 9 , and 1.0 - 3.1 - 9 , all after 1370 yr . \n it can be seen that in spite of the variation in the initial degree of instability , the dispersions in the outermost disks all converge to similar values of @xmath0 1% to 2% . \n this suggests that mgu disk evolutions are not particularly sensitive to the exact choice of the initial @xmath2 profile , a result that was also found by boss ( 2011 ) for somewhat more massive disks . \n as also found by boss ( 2011 ) , the dispersions in the innermost disks are significantly higher ( @xmath0 10% to 20% ) than in the outermost disks , a direct result of the stronger mixing associated with the cooler outer disks , in spite of the longer orbital periods in the outer disks . \n table 3 shows the initial conditions for the models with either @xmath43 disks around @xmath44 protostars , or @xmath45 disks around @xmath46 protostars . in either case \n , the disks extend from 1 au to 10 au . \n these models are of interest for exploring how conditions might vary between disks around g dwarfs and m dwarfs , with possible ramifications for the habitability of any rocky planets that form ( e.g. , raymond et al . 2007 ) around m dwarfs . \n figure 2 shows the initial midplane temperature profiles for these models . \n figure 7 shows the time evolution of the dispersion for model 0.1 - 1.8 - 2 , appropriate for a late m dwarf protostar . as in all the models \n , it can be seen that the initially highly heterogeneous disk becomes rapidly homogenized , in this case by about 5000 yr . \n note that this time scale is considerably longer than that for g dwarf disk mixing and transport processes , as a result of the longer keplerian orbital periods for lower mass , m dwarf protostars . \n as in the g dwarf protostar models ( e.g. , figure 5 ) , the inner disk dispersion is higher than in the outer disk , though in these models ( with a lower initial @xmath47 ) the inner disk dispersion drops to @xmath0 5% to 10% , compared to @xmath0 1% to 2% in the outer disk . \n figure 8 shows the same behavior for model 0.1 - 1.8 - 9 , which differs from the previous model shown in figure 7 only in having the injection occur at 9 au instead of 2 au . as in the g dwarf disks , \n the dispersions for both of these models evolve toward essentially identical radial distributions : the underlying mgu disk evolution determines the outcome for the dispersions . \n similar results hold for the models with @xmath46 protostars , i.e. , early m dwarf disks . \n we now turn to a consideration of the consequence of single - shot versus continuous injection at the surface of much larger outer radius ( 40 au ) disks than have been considered to date for g dwarf stars ; boss ( 2007 ) considered disks extending from 4 au to 20 au in radius . \n table 4 shows the initial conditions for the models with a @xmath48 disk around a @xmath38 protostar , with the disks extending from 10 au to 40 au . because of the much larger inner and outer disk radii for this set of models , \n these models can be calculated for times as long as @xmath49 yr ( table 4 ) . \n such times are still considerably less than the typical ages ( @xmath50 yr ) of t tauri stars , implying that in order for mgu disks to occur at such late phases , a prior phase of coupled mri - mgu evolution might be required to make the present results relevant .    figures 9 and 10 display the evolution of the dispersions for models 1.0 - 1.1 - 40 - 20 and 1.0 - 1.1 - 40 - 20c , differing only in that the former model has single - shot injection while the latter model has continuous injection , intended to simulate a disk with ongoing uv photolysis and fractionation at the outer disk surface . for model 1.0 - 1.1 - 40 - 20 \n , it can be seen that the evolution is similar to that of the previous single - shot models : a rapid drop in the dispersion , followed by homogenization to @xmath0 1% to 2% away from the inner disk boundary . \n the higher dispersions seen near the outer disk boundaries ( @xmath0 40 au ) are largely caused by the unphysical pile - up of considerable disk mass at 40 au and should be discounted . however , for the continuous injection model shown in figure 10 , it can be seen that the dispersions throughout the disk even after @xmath3 yr can be as high as @xmath0 20% , consistent with the much larger variation in stable oxygen isotope ratios , compared to slri ratios . in a calculation with finer spatial grid resolution , as well as perhaps sub - grid mixing processes , one might expect even stronger homogenization to occur , so the dispersion levels obtained from the present models should be considered to be upper bounds . \n the total amount of color added during the continuous injection models is large , compared to single - shot injection models : for model 1.0 - 1.4 - 40 - 20c , for example , after 200 yr , the total amount of color injected has increased by a factor of @xmath0 90 compared to the single - shot total , and by another factor of @xmath0 60 after 27000 yr . \n figures 11 and 12 compare the results for continuous injection at either 20 au or 30 au , respectively , i.e. , for models 1.0 - 1.1 - 40 - 20c and 1.0 - 1.1 - 40 - 30c . in spite of the different injection radii , figures 11 and 12 \n show that even at a relatively early phase ( 405 yr ) of evolution , the midplane color / gas ratios look somewhat similar ; as before , the mgu disk evolution is the same for both models , and that is the primary determinant of the long term evolution .    finally , similar results as those shown in figures 9 - 12 were obtained for the other models listed in table 4 . \n these models show that the main factor in determining the radial dispersion profile is whether the injection occurs in a single - shot or continuously ; in the latter case , the mgu disk does its best to homogenize the color field , but the fact that spatial heterogeneity is being continuously injected limits the degree to which this heterogeneity can be reduced . \n while dust grains in the interstellar medium are overwhelmingly amorphous , crystalline silicate grains have been found in a late m dwarf ( sst - lup3 - 1 ) disk at distances ranging from inside 3 au to beyond 5 au , in both the midplane and surface layers ( mern et al . \n such crystalline silicate grains are likely to have been produced by thermal annealing in the hottest regions of the disk , well inside of 1 au ( sargent et al . \n 2009 ) . again \n , outward transport seems to be required to explain the observations , and the results for the models with a 0.1 @xmath1 protostar suggest that mgu phases in low mass m dwarf disks may be responsible for these observations . in fact , crystalline mass fractions in protoplanetary disks do not appear to correlate with stellar mass , luminosity , accretion rate , disk mass , or the disk to star ratio ( watson et al . \n these results also appear to be consistent with the results of the present models , which show that mgu disk phases are equally capable of relatively rapid large - scale mixing and transport , regardless of the stellar or disk mass , or the exact value of the @xmath2 stability parameter . \n these models have shown a rather robust result , namely that a phase of marginal gravitational instability in disks and stars with a variety of masses and disk temperatures can lead to relatively rapid inward and outward transport of disk gas and small grains , as required to drive the protostellar mass accretion associated with fu orionis events , as well as to explain the discovery of refractory grains in comet 81p / wild 2 . \n a mgu disk phase driving a fu orionis outburst is astronomically quite likely to have occurred for our protosun , and cosmochemically convenient for explaining the relative homogeneity of @xmath4al/@xmath42al ratios derived from a supernova injection event , and the range of @xmath5o/@xmath6o ratios derived from sustained uv self - shielding at the surface of the outer solar nebula . \n low - mass stars , from g dwarfs to m dwarfs , may well experience a similar phase of mgu disk mixing and transport . in this context , it is worthwhile to note that fu orionis itself , the prototype of the fu orionis outburst phenomenon , has a mass of only @xmath51 ( zhu et al . \n 2007 , 2009b ; beck & aspin 2012 ) , i.e. , the mass of a m dwarf , suggesting that m dwarf protoplanetary disks may experience evolutions similar to that of the solar nebula , with possible implications for the habitability of any resulting planetary system ( e.g. , raymond et al . 2007 ; bonfils et al . 2013 ; dressing & charbonneau 2013 ; kopparapu 2013 ) . \n i thank jeff cuzzi for his comments , the referee for a number of suggested improvements , and sandy keiser , michael acierno , and ben pandit for their support of the cluster computing environment at dtm . \n this work was partially supported by the nasa origins of solar systems program ( nnx09af62 g ) and is contributed in part to the nasa astrobiology institute ( nna09da81a ) . \n some of the calculations were performed on the carnegie alpha cluster , the purchase of which was partially supported by a nsf major research instrumentation grant ( mri-9976645 ) . \n 1.0 & 0.019 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & 1.0 & 1.0 & 10.0 + 0.5 & 0.018 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & 1.0 & 1.0 & 10.0 + 0.1 & 0.016 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & 1.0 & 1.0 & 10.0 + 1.0 & 0.13 & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & 4.0 & 10.0 & 40.0 +      1.0 -

        "abstract": "The study explores marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disks in young stars, analyzing their role in mixing and transporting materials during the solar system's formation. MGU disks rapidly homogenize short-lived isotopes within ~1,000 years, while stable oxygen isotopes retain ~10% heterogeneity due to continuous UV photolysis. These findings suggest the protosun likely experienced FU Orionis-like outbursts, aiding in the large-scale transport of refractory grains and isotopes, as evidenced in meteorites and comet samples. The models examine disks of varied mass and stability around stars of differing masses, confirming their role in solar system material distribution."

the long tail at low mass comes from gluon radiation . for each value of new particle mass in 50 gev / c@xmath1 steps , \n we perform a binned maximum likelihood fit of the data to the background parameterization and the mass resonance shape . in fig . \n [ fig_resonance ] we display the best fit and 95% confidence level upper limit for a 550 gev / c@xmath1 resonance . for the mass region @xmath26 \n gev / c@xmath1 , there are 2947 events in the data , @xmath27 events ( @xmath28 ) in the background for the fit without a resonance , @xmath29 events ( @xmath30 ) in the background for the fit that includes the resonance , and the value of the resonance cross section from the fit is @xmath31 pb ( statistical ) .    in fig . \n [ fig_cos ] we study the angular distribution of the fluctuation in the mass region @xmath26 gev / c@xmath1 . \n the angular distribution is compatible with both qcd alone , and with    = 3.3 in = 3.3 in    qcd + 5% excited quark ( best fit ) . \n this amount of excited quark is coincidentally the same as found in the mass fit . \n although the fluctuation is interesting , we conclude it is not yet    = 3.3 in = 3.3 in    statistically significant , and proceed to set limits on new particle production . \n = 3.3 in = 3.3 in    from the likelihood distribution including experimental systematic uncertainties  @xcite we obtain the 95% cl upper limit on the cross section for new particles shown in fig . \n [ fig_dijet_limit ] . \n we compare this to the cross section for axigluons ( excluding @xmath32 gev / c@xmath1 ) , excited quarks ( excluding @xmath33 gev / c@xmath1 ) , technirhos ( excluding @xmath34 gev / c@xmath1 ) , w@xmath35 ( excluding @xmath36 gev / c@xmath1 ) , z@xmath35 ( excluding @xmath37 gev / c@xmath1 ) , and e6 diquarks ( excluding @xmath38 gev / c@xmath1 ) . \n the calculations are lowest order  @xcite using cteq2l parton distributions  @xcite and one - loop @xmath39 and require @xmath16 and @xmath40 . \n the large mass of the top quark suggests that the third generation may be special . \n topcolor  @xcite assumes that the top mass is large mainly because of a dynamical @xmath5 condensate generated by a new strong dynamics coupling to the third generation . here \n the @xmath41 of qcd is a low energy symmetry arising from the breaking of an @xmath42 coupling to the third generation and an @xmath43 coupling to the first two generations only . \n there are then massive color octet bosons , topgluons @xmath44 , which couple largely to @xmath4 and @xmath5 . \n the topgluon is strongly produced and decays mainly to the third generation ( @xmath45 ) with a relatively large natural width ( @xmath46 ) . \n here we search for the topgluon in the @xmath4 channel . \n an additional @xmath47 symmetry is introduced  @xcite to keep the @xmath48 quark light while the top quark is heavy ; this leads to a topcolor @xmath6 , which again couples largely to @xmath4 and @xmath5 . \n the topcolor @xmath6 is electroweakly produced and decays mainly to the third generation ( @xmath49 ) with a narrow natural width ( @xmath50 ) . \n here we search for the topcolor @xmath6 in both the the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channel ; the @xmath5 channel is the most sensitive because the coupling to @xmath5 is larger . \n we start with the dijet search in 19 pb@xmath0 of run 1a data  @xcite and additionally require at least one of the two leading jets be tagged as a bottom quark . \n the b - tag requires a displaced vertex in the the secondary vertex detector  @xcite . \n the @xmath4 event efficiency is @xmath51% independent of dijet mass . from fits to the @xmath52 distribution \n , we estimate that the sample is roughly 50% bottom , 30% charm , and 20% mistags of plain jets . \n pythia predicts that 1/5 of these bottom quarks are direct @xmath4 , and the rest are from gluon splitting and flavor excitation . \n consequentially , only about @xmath53% @xmath54 10% of our sample is direct @xmath4 . \n we expect both the purity and efficiency to increase when we use the run 1b dataset and a new tagging algorithm  @xcite \n . with higher tagging efficiency we should be able to make better use of double b - tagged events like the one in fig . \n [ fig_btag_event ] . \n = 2.6 in = 2.6 in    in fig . \n [ fig_btag ] we show the b - tagged dijet mass distribution corrected for the @xmath4 efficiency . \n also shown is the untagged dijet mass distribution from run 1a , and both are well fit with our standard parameterization  @xcite . \n the b - tagged dijet data has an upward fluctuation near 600 gev / c@xmath1 . \n we model the shape of a narrow resonance using pythia z@xmath3 production and a cdf detector simulation . in fig . \n [ fig_btag ] we fit the b - tagged data to a 600 gev / c@xmath1 narrow resonance , and find a cross section of @xmath55 pb ( statistical ) . \n note that this is comparable to the dijet fluctuation in both mass and rate . however , there are only 8 events in the last two data bins of fig . \n [ fig_btag ] , and the fluctuation is only a @xmath56 effect , so we proceed to set limits on new particle production . \n we perform two kinds of fits for the limits . \n first , narrow resonances are modelled as described above , and the mass resolution in the cdf detector is shown in fig . \n [ fig_b_bbar_res ] . \n second , wide resonances characteristic of topgluons  @xcite , including interference with normal gluons , was incorporated into pythia and a cdf detector simulation . the mass resolution in fig . \n [ fig_b_bbar_res ] displays destructive interference to the left of the resonance ; models with destructive interference on the right side of the resonance will be considered in the future . \n = 3.2 in = 3.2 in    limits on new particle production are shown in fig . \n [ fig_btag_limit ] . \n the theoretical cross sections are lowest order and use cteq2l parton distributions . for narrow resonances the production cross sections are nt large enough for us to set mass limits at this time . for topgluons \n the production cross sections  @xcite are larger , and we are able to exclude at 95% cl topgluons of width @xmath57 in the mass region @xmath58 gev / c@xmath1 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 gev / c@xmath1 , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 gev / c@xmath1 .    = 3.0 in = 3.0 in    = 7.7 in \n to search for new particles decaying to @xmath5 we start with the data sample from the top mass measurement  @xcite . \n there we used top decays to w + four jets with at least one b - tag , and found 19 events on a background of @xmath63 , resulting in a top mass of @xmath64(stat)@xmath65(sys ) gev / c@xmath1 . that analysis fit the entire event for the top hypothesis , discarding events with @xmath66 ( poor fit ) . \n here we add the additional constraint that the top mass is 176 gev / c@xmath1 , which significantly enhances our resolution of the @xmath5 mass . \n two of the 19 events fail the @xmath66 cut when the top mass constraint is added to the fit , leaving us with 17 events . \n the @xmath5 mass distribution expected from a narrow resonance , normalized to the topcolor @xmath6 predicted rate  @xcite , is shown in fig . \n [ fig_ttbar ] . \n here we used pythia @xmath67 . \n also in fig . \n [ fig_ttbar ] is the monte carlo distribution of the background , on the left standard model top production from herwig , and on the right qcd w + jets background from vecbos with parton showers from herwig . \n all monte carlos include a cdf detector simulation . on the left in fig . \n [ fig_ttbar ] , the comparison of the topcolor z@xmath3 to sm @xmath5 simulations illustrates that in this data sample we are sensitive to topcolor @xmath6 up to a mass of roughly 600 gev / c@xmath1 . finally , on the right in fig . \n [ fig_ttbar ] , we present the @xmath5 candidate mass distribution from cdf compared to the total standard model prediction . given the statistics the agreement is quite good overall . \n the small shoulder of 6 events on a background of @xmath68 in the region @xmath69 gev / c@xmath1 is in an interesting mass region , given the dijet and @xmath4 search results , but is not statistically significant . \n upper limits on the @xmath5 cross section as a function of @xmath5 mass , and on a topcolor @xmath6 , are currently in progress . \n = 3.1 in = 3.1 in \n we have searched for new particles decaying to dijets , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . in the dijet channel we set the most significant direct mass exclusions to date on the hadronic decays of axigluons ( excluding @xmath70 gev / c@xmath1 ) , excited quarks ( excluding @xmath71 gev / c@xmath1 ) , technirhos ( excluding @xmath34 gev / c@xmath1 ) , w@xmath3 ( excluding @xmath36 gev / c@xmath1 ) , z@xmath35 ( excluding @xmath37 gev / c@xmath1 ) , and for the first time e6 diquarks ( excluding @xmath38 gev / c@xmath1 ) . in the @xmath4 channel \n we set the first limits on topcolor , excluding a model of topgluons for width @xmath57 in the mass region @xmath58 gev / c@xmath1 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 gev / c@xmath1 , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 gev / c@xmath1 . \n the search for topcolor in the @xmath5 channel has just begun and limits are in progress . \n limits are only a consolation prize ; the main emphasis of our search is to explore the possibility of a signal . although we do not have significant evidence for new particle production , the @xmath72 gev / c@xmath1 region shows upward fluctuations in all three channels . \n we can not ignore the exciting possibility that these apparently separate fluctuations may be the first signs of a new physics beyond the standard model . \n the remaining integrated luminosity for run 1b , currently being accumulated and analyzed , has the potential to either kill the fluctuations or reveal what may be the most interesting new physics in a generation . \n +    f. abe et al . \n ( cdf ) , phys . \n lett . * 74 * , 3538 ( 1995 ) . \n p. frampton and s. glashow , phys . \n b190 * , 157 ( 1987 ) . \n u. baur et al . , int . j. mod . \n phys a2 , 1285(1987 ) & pr*d42 * , 815(1990 ) . \n k. lane et al . \n , pr*d44 * , 2768(1991 ) & phys . lett . \n * b327 * , 129(1994 ) . \n j. hewett and t. rizzo , phys . rep . \n * 183 * , 193 ( 1989 ) . \n talk by anwar bhatti in these proceedings . \n parameterization @xmath73 with parameters a , n and p. for new gauge bosons we use a k - factor to account for higher order terms . \n j. botts et al . \n ( cteq collaboration ) phys . lett . * \n b304 * , 159 ( 1993 ) . c. hill and s. parke , phys \n . rev . * d49 * , 4454 ( 1994 ) . c. hill , phys . \n b345 * , 483 ( 1994 ) . \n f. abe et al . \n ( cdf ) , phys . rev . * \n d50*,2966 ( 1994 ) . \n f. abe et al . \n ( cdf ) , phys . \n lett . * 74 * , 2626 ( 1995 ) . \n we model the interference between normal gluons and topgluons using hybrid model c in phys . rev . * d49 * , 4454 ( 1994 ) . \n g. burdman , c. hill , and s. parke private communication .",
        "abstract": "CDF searched for new particles decaying into jets and heavy quarks. They observed a small excess of events near 550–600 GeV/c², possibly signaling exotic particles like axigluons, technirhos, or topcolor bosons, but not at a significant level. They set strong limits on various candidates, excluding several mass ranges. While no definitive new physics emerged, the hints remain intriguing. Further data and analysis could clarify whether these fluctuations are just random or the first signs of something new."

        "article": "this review focuses specifically on what we have learned about the progenitors of core - collapse supernovae ( cc  sne ) by examining images of the supernova ( sn ) sites taken prior to the explosion . by registering pre - sn and post - sn images , usually taken at high resolution using either space - based optical detectors , or ground - based infrared detectors equipped with laser guide star adaptive optics systems ( lgs - ao ) , about one dozen cc sn progenitors have now been directly detected ( i.e. , shown to be spatially coincident with the sn ) in pre - sn images , with roughly two dozen upper limits derived from non - detections @xcite . \n this field has come a long way in the last decade , and promises to advance rapidly as more and more nearby galaxies  hosts of future cc sne  have high - resolution images added to the archive . \n this review is organized as follows . following a brief summary of sn classification and stellar evolution theory (   2 ) , one example from each of the following three categories of progenitor studies \n is provided (   3 ; ordered from most - to - least common ) : ( 1 ) no progenitor star detected in pre - sn image(s ) ; ( 2 ) likely progenitor star identified via spatial coincidence in pre - sn and post - sn images ; ( 3 ) progenitor star detected in pre - sn image(s ) and subsequently confirmed by demonstrating its absence in images taken after the sn has faded beyond detection . a summary of overall results to date for each sn type \n is then given (   4 ) , followed by a brief discussion of outstanding questions and areas in which future progress is likely (   5 ) . \n note that discussion is limited to what the examination of images of sn sites taken prior to the explosion has taught us , and necessarily excludes ( or relegates to very brief comment ) such related investigations as sn environments ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also the article by elias rosa in this volume ) and sn progenitor `` forensics '' ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also the article by modjaz in this volume ) . for a comprehensive discussion of all such related areas , \n see the recent review by @xcite . \n it is typical to subdivide cc  sne into at least five major categories ( see @xcite for a thorough review ) : ii - plateau ( ii - p ; hydrogen in spectrum and plateau in optical light curve ) , ii - linear ( ii - l ; hydrogen in spectrum , no plateau in optical light curve ) , iin ( hydrogen in spectrum and spectral and photometric evidence for interaction between sn ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium [ csm ] ) , iib ( hydrogen in spectrum initially , but transforms into a hydrogen - deficient spectrum at later times ) , and ib / c ( no evidence for hydrogen in spectrum at any time ) , where the ordering is a roughly increasing one in terms of inferred degree of envelope stripping prior to explosion ( i.e. , ii - p are the least stripped at the time of explosion , and ib / c are the most stripped ) . \n while most of this review focuses on the observational advances that have been made , theoretical input is critical to translate observed progenitor luminosity ( or limits ) into zero - age - main - sequence masses ( @xmath0 ) and stellar evolutionary states . among the most complete ( and accessiblestars . ] ) stellar evolution models at present are the metallicity - dependent models produced with the cambridge stellar evolution code , stars , the descendant of the code developed originally by @xcite and updated most recently by @xcite ( 2004 ; see also @xcite , and references therein ) , since they follow stellar evolution up to the initiation of core neon burning , which is likely to give an accurate indication of the pre - sn luminosity . \n the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) of the stars evolutionary tracks are shown in figure  1 for stars ranging in initial mass from @xmath1 . \n comparison with other contemporary model grids ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) show that the endpoints for stars in the @xmath2 range differ by at most @xmath3 dex in luminosity among the codes @xcite , which gives some assurance that systematic uncertainties are not great , at least at the low - mass end for red supergiant ( rsg ) stars . \n two areas of uncertainty in need of better quantification ( or , at least , agreement within the community ) include the effects that stellar rotation and mass - loss might have on the observable characteristics of stars prior to core collapse . \n not surprisingly , when no progenitor star is actually detected at the sn location in pre - sn images , only an upper limit to the progenitor s luminosity and , hence , mass , can be derived . to illustrate the analysis process in such a situation , i consider sn  2006my , an sn \n ii - p that exploded in a galaxy @xmath4 mpc away ( nearly all sne with progenitor studies are within @xmath5 mpc , since source confusion becomes an increasing problem with distance ) . \n details for this particular event are provided by @xcite ; here i briefly outline the steps my colleagues and i took to derive an upper mass limit on its progenitor .    the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) imaged the site of sn  2006my using the wide - field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in 1994 ( pre - sn ) and again in 2007 ( shortly after explosion ) . \n we registered the two images and pinpointed the sn location to better than 30 milli - arcsec in the pre - sn frame ( figure 2a , b ) . \n such fine registration allowed us to rule out a nearby point source ( source ` 1 ' in figure 2a ) as the progenitor star with greater than @xmath6 confidence . \n ( note that this source had been previously identified by @xcite as the likely progenitor based on registration with lower - resolution ground - based optical post - sn images . ) \n we next set an @xmath7-band detection limit in the pre - sn frame by placing artificial stars of progressively fainter magnitude at the sn location and letting the photometry software ( in this case , hstphot , see @xcite ) attempt to detect them . \n the point at which the software no longer detected a point source then serves as the limiting upper magnitude for the progenitor star .    to translate this single - filter detection limit into a luminosity , we assumed that the progenitor was a rsg ( given other sn  ii - p progenitor detections this seems a reasonable assumption ; see  3.2 and  4 ) , and then determined the greatest bolometric magnitude it could have had while still remaining below our detection threshold . \n this is accomplished through :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the distance modulus of the host galaxy ( ngc 4651 ) , @xmath10 the extinction to sn  2006my , @xmath7 the @xmath7-band detection threshold , @xmath11 the color range of rsg stars ( i.e. , spectral types @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 the bolometric correction corresponding to each @xmath14 . upon adopting the most conservative values for each of the parameters ( i.e. , the ones that produce the least restrictive @xmath15 for the progenitor s upper luminosity limit ) , and allowing for a maximum systematic uncertainty of 0.2 dex in the theoretical stellar model endpoints ( see   2 ) , the limiting bolometric magnitude above which any rsg would have been detected in our pre - sn image , @xmath15 , is derived . \n we then compared this with the final luminosity of stars with @xmath16 predicted by the stars stellar evolution models ( figure 2c ) to derive an upper bound on the progenitor mass of @xmath17 . from this analysis , then , we conclude that any rsg progenitor with an initial mass greater than @xmath18 would have been detected using our analysis procedure .    analyses similar to that described here for sn  2006my have been carried out on each of 22 non - detections in pre - sn images @xcite . as we shall see (   4 ) , it is the sheer number of such progenitor non - detections that permits rather strong conclusions to be drawn about cc sn progenitors from this category of progenitor studies . \n next , we consider the individually more revealing situation where an object coincident with the transformed sn location is actually detected in the pre - sn image(s ) , a situation that exists now for 11 cc sne @xcite . as an outstanding example of the analytic power provided by having multi - filter pre - sn images available ( especially in the near infrared for rsg progenitors ) , we consider the recent work of @xcite on sn  2008bk , a very nearby ( @xmath19 mpc ) sn  ii - p . in this case , \n pre - sn ground - based images in @xmath20 were registered with post - sn lgs - ao @xmath21-band images to yield solid progenitor star detections in @xmath22 , and upper luminosity limits in @xmath23 and @xmath24 . when compared with the known spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of rsg , a good match for the progenitor of sn  2008bk \n is found with a progenitor of spectral type m4i ( figure  3 ) . from comparison with the stars stellar evolutionary models an initial progenitor mass of @xmath25 \n is derived for this sn . \n similar studies on seven other detected sn  ii - p progenitors have found stars consistent with rsg in all cases , providing nice agreement between theory and observation . as we shall see in   4 , however , the _ range _ of masses inferred for these rsg progenitors is somewhat unexpected . \n finally , we consider the most satisfying situation where images taken before , during , and long after the sn explosion exist that clearly show the progenitor star , the sn , and the absence of the progenitor star , respectively . \n such a sequence provides nearly conclusive proof of the progenitor star s identity . \n currently , such a time series exists for only two objects : sn  1987a ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) and sn  2005gl @xcite . \n because the case of sn  1987a is well - known , i present sn  2005gl as the example of this situation ; it also clearly demonstrates the investigative power provided by having a third observation , long after the sn has dropped below detection . \n as shown by @xcite , early spectra of sn  2005gl exhibited the classic features of a type iin event , showing narrow but resolved lines of hydrogen superposed on an intermediate - width component on an otherwise featureless continuum . \n analysis of the spectral features indicate ejecta interacting with a dense csm , whose properties suggest that the progenitor star exploded shortly after an lbv - like mass - loss episode . comparison of a pre - sn _ hst _ image with a post - sn image obtained from the ground using the lgs - ao at the keck ii telescope established a spatial coincidence between the sn and a very bright source possessing an estimated luminosity of over @xmath26 ( @xcite ; see figures  4a and 4b ) . \n the only single stars known to possess such an extraordinary luminosity are very massive ( @xmath27 ; see figure  1 ) , which conventional theory predicts should explode only after the lbv phase has ended @xcite . \n initially , strong claims for the unexpectedly luminous progenitor / sn  2005gl association had to be tempered by consideration of the distance of sn  2005gl s host galaxy . at over 60 mpc away , the @xmath28 resolution of the pre - sn _ hst _ image corresponds to @xmath5 pc , which raises suspicion that the object could be , e.g. , an unresolved stellar cluster or association of several massive stars , with only part of the light coming from the actual progenitor of sn  2005gl @xcite . \n additional observations , therefore , were clearly needed to settle the case , and two years later , an additional _ hst _ observation was made . \n this observation demonstrates that the luminous source in the pre - sn image has , indeed , disappeared ( figure  4c ) , which implies that the progenitor of sn  2005gl was a single , extremely luminous , star that exploded while in the lbv phase @xcite . \n such a luminosity is indicative of having had an initial mass of @xmath29 , which likely left behind a stellar mass black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n in addition to exploding during an unexpected evolutionary phase , the very fact _ that _ such a massive star is demonstrated to have exploded at all  as opposed to directly collapsing to a black hole with no sn explosion  is important , since the optical signature produced at the time of stellar collapse to a black hole is , at present , virtually unconstrained by either observation or theory ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . \n the three examples discussed in   3 serve to illustrate how the science of seeking progenitors in pre - sn images is carried out , and what conclusions can typically be drawn . \n i now briefly summarize results to date arising from direct progenitor searches in pre - sn images ; for a more comprehensive review , see @xcite . \n * type ii - plateau : * sne  ii - p are by far the most well - defined category of cc sne in terms of direct observational progenitor constraints , having had eight putative progenitor detections made and 12 upper luminosity limits established . \n all of the available evidence suggests that rsg are the immediate progenitors of sne  ii - p . by employing a uniform reduction and analysis procedure , \n @xcite has produced the cumulative frequency distribution shown in figure  5 for sne  ii - p , from which an intriguing result is immediately evident : all but one of the sne  ii - p have initial masses constrained to be @xmath30 , with the most massive _ detected _ progenitor of an sn  ii - p having a mass of only @xmath31 . \n this is surprising , since rsg up to @xmath32 are clearly observed in the local group ( * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) , and would have easily been detected in the pre - sn images . \n this lack of massive rsg progenitors for sne ii - p lead @xcite to speculate that these massive rsg progenitors may be forming black holes heralded by faint , or non - existent , sn explosions ( see also * ? ? ? \n * type ii - linear : * a rare type of cc sn , it is perhaps not surprising that only one sn  ii - l ( sn  1980k ) has a pre - sn image , the analysis of which rules out massive rsg greater than about @xmath33 @xcite . \n analysis of the stellar population of the type ii - l sn  1979c by @xcite determines a mass range of @xmath34 for its progenitor . at this point , \n firm conclusions about the progenitors of sne  ii - l can not be made , although early indications are that at least some do not arise from extremely massive stars . \n * type iin : * sn  2005gl , described earlier in this review (   3.3 ) as having a very massive ( @xmath27 ) progenitor that exploded while in the lbv phase , is the only example of an sn  iin for which a progenitor has been detected in pre - sn images . \n whether such a massive progenitor is indicative of the class as a whole is not known . \n * type iib : * pre - sn images exist for two events . \n first , sn  1993j in m81 , where extensive analyses of pre - sn and post - sn images ( and spectra ) lead to the conclusion that a @xmath35 star exploded in a binary system , with a slightly less massive secondary surviving the explosion ( * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) . \n very recently , the type iib sn  2008ax has provided a great opportunity to further investigate this rare class of cc sne since pre - sn _ \n hst_/wfpc2 images exist in @xmath36 . \n a study by @xcite finds a curiously flat sed for the progenitor star , which is impossible to reconcile with a single rsg , but may be consistent with an early - type w - r ( wn class ) progenitor , suggesting a progenitor star with a large ( @xmath37 ) initial mass . \n * type ib / c : * a well - studied class , with ten upper limits but no detections from analysis of pre - sn images . \n the lack of detections is surprising , since it is commonly thought that at least some of the progenitors of sne  ib / c should be luminous , single w - r stars , in addition to others perhaps arising from lower mass stars in binary systems . while none of the non - detections definitively rule out a w - r progenitor \n , @xcite demonstrates that it is quite unlikely at this point that all sne  ib / c come from them . \n a summary of the current state of affairs of cc sn progenitor research via studies of pre - sn images is provided by figure  6 . \n the science of seeking sn progenitors has made tremendous strides in just the last ten years . for the future , \n i look with particular interest at the extremes as areas ripe for breakthrough discoveries , since it is there that many of our most fundamental questions lie . on the low - mass end , how will the lack of massive rsg progenitors for sne  ii - p be resolved ? \n are we seeing the first glimpse of the mass cutoff for direct collapse to black holes ? \n if so , then how will this be reconciled with the _ very _ massive stars ( i.e. , the other mass extreme ) that apparently do explode as sne  iin or possibly iib ? and finally , how does binarity influence all of these conclusions ? \n clearly , we are just at the beginning stages of this exciting field of research , and great advances will no doubt be made in the coming decade . \n i thank the scientific organizing committee of the `` hot and cool : bridging gaps in massive star evolution '' conference for inviting me to provide this review . \n i thank seppo mattila for permitting reproduction of a figure from a recent paper , and stephen smartt for allowing the use of figures in advance of publication of his annual reviews article on the topic .",
        "abstract": "Observations of pre-supernova images reveal insights into core-collapse supernova progenitors. High-resolution imaging has enabled direct identification or luminosity constraints of nearly three dozen progenitors, supporting stellar evolution models. Type II-Plateau supernovae originate from red supergiants, while rare types like SN 2005gl exhibit massive luminous progenitors in unexpected phases. Analytical techniques and comparisons with models advance understanding of progenitor masses, evolutionary stages, and explosion mechanisms. Outstanding questions include the fate of massive stars and the role of binarity in progenitor evolution. This field promises significant discoveries in the coming decade."

        "article": "single - transverse spin asymmetries ( ssas ) play a fundamental role for our understanding of qcd in high - energy hadronic scattering . \n they may be obtained for reactions in , for example , lepton - proton or proton - proton scattering with one transversely polarized initial proton , by dividing the difference of the cross sections for the two settings of the transverse polarization by their sum . \n there have been extensive experimental investigations of such asymmetries  @xcite . \n these have initiated much theoretical progress , in particular within the last few years . \n a particular focus has been on a class of single - spin observables that are characterized by a large momentum scale @xmath1 ( for example , the virtuality of the photon in deeply - inelastic scattering ( dis ) ) and by a much smaller , but also measured , transverse momentum @xmath2 . \n in such a `` two - scale '' situation , single - spin asymmetries may arise at leading power , that is , not suppressed by an inverse power of @xmath1 . for some of these cases , \n factorization theorems have been established  @xcite that allow to write the spin - dependent cross sections in terms of parton distribution functions and/or fragmentation functions , perturbative hard - scattering functions , and so - called soft factors . \n a crucial feature is that the distribution functions and the soft factor in this factorization are not integrated over the transverse momenta of partons , because these in fact generate the observed transverse momentum @xmath2 . among other things \n , the observables may therefore provide valuable insights into the dependence of parton distributions in nucleons on transverse momentum . \n this becomes particularly interesting when the nucleon is transversely polarized , because there may be correlations between the nucleon spin vector , its momentum , and the parton s transverse momentum . \n one particular correlation , known as the `` sivers effect '' and described by so - called `` sivers functions ''  @xcite , is now widely believed to be involved in a variety of observed hadronic single - spin phenomena . \n closer theoretical studies have revealed that the sivers effect plays an important role in qcd , beyond giving rise to phenomenological functions to be used in the description of single - spin asymmetries . \n a particularly interesting feature is that the sivers effect is not universal in the usual sense , that is , it is not represented by universal probability functions convoluted with partonic hard - scattering cross sections . \n this might at first sight appear to make the study of these functions less interesting . \n however , the non - universality has in fact a clear physical origin , and its closer investigation has turned out to be an extremely important and productive development in qcd . in a nutshell , in order not to be forced to vanish because of the time - reversal symmetry of qcd , single - spin asymmetries require the presence of a strong - interaction phase . for the sivers functions this phase originates from the `` gauge links '' in their definition  @xcite , which are path - ordered exponentials of the gluon field that make the functions gauge - invariant . in dis \n , the gauge link may be viewed as a rescattering of the parton in the color field of the nucleon remnant . that such a final - state rescattering may generate the phase required for a nonzero ssa in semi - inclusive hadron production in dis ( sidis ) was first discovered within a model calculation  @xcite . \n depending on the hard - scattering process , the `` rescattering '' will however manifest itself in different ways . \n for example , for drell - yan lepton pair production in hadronic scattering , _ initial - state _ , rather than final - state , interactions are relevant . as a result , the phase provided by the gauge links is opposite , and the sivers functions for the drell - yan process have opposite sign  @xcite . in more general terms , \n the nontrivial  universality \" property of the sivers functions is the direct consequence of gauge interactions in quantum chromodynamics  @xcite , and of the qcd factorization theorems applying to the relevant hard processes  @xcite . \n it is a remarkable and fundamental qcd prediction that really tests all concepts we know of for analyzing hard - scattering reactions in strong interactions , and it awaits experimental verification .    while measurements of ssas in sidis are now maturing and have established the presence of sivers - type contributions  @xcite , it will still be a while until precise single - spin measurements in the relatively rare drell - yan process will become feasible at rhic  @xcite or elsewhere  @xcite . however , there are of course other hard - scattering reactions in hadronic collisions for which single - transverse spin asymmetries may be defined , and that may potentially be used in lieu of the drell - yan process for testing the nontrivial \n universality \" properties of the sivers functions . in @xcite , it was proposed to use the ssa in azimuthal correlations of two jets produced in @xmath0 collisions at rhic to learn about the sivers functions . to a first approximation , \n such dijets are produced by @xmath3 partonic qcd hard - scattering . \n with collinear kinematics , the jets are exactly `` back - to - back '' in the plane perpendicular to the initial beam directions and thus separated by @xmath4 in azimuthal angle in this plane . \n partonic transverse momenta will generate deviations from this topology , because they will lead on average to a non - vanishing net transverse momentum @xmath2 of the jet pair , much smaller than each of the jet transverse momenta @xmath5 individually . \n the observable is therefore of the `` two - scale '' type described above , and as was shown in @xcite , if one proton is polarized , a single - spin asymmetry may be defined that is in principle sensitive to the sivers functions . as \n a caveat , factorization of the spin - dependent cross section for this observable in terms of transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) functions still remains to be established .    unlike the relatively simple cases of sidis and the drell - yan process , where either final - state or initial - state interactions contribute to the sivers asymmetry , both are present for dijet production @xcite \n this complicates the analysis of the process - dependence of the sivers functions considerably , but at the same time it also makes it much more interesting from a theoretical point of view , because the interactions in this case are `` truly qcd '' , that is , they involve the detailed gauge structure of the theory , including for example its non - abelian nature . at the time of @xcite , \n the process - dependence had not yet been worked out for the case of the ssa in dijet production , so that phenomenological predictions had to remain qualitative , at best . over the last year \n , however , there has been extensive work on deriving and clarifying the structure of the gauge links for this and related processes in @xmath0 collisions @xcite . \n indeed , the resulting structure is far more complicated than that in sidis or the drell - yan process . \n however , it turns out that if one takes a certain weighted integral ( `` moment '' ) of the asymmetry , remarkable simplifications occur . \n this moment is defined by integrating the spin - dependent cross section with a factor @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the azimuthal imbalance between the two jets ( @xmath8 if the jets are exactly back - to - back in azimuth ) . for each of the various contributing @xmath3 partonic channels , \n the gauge link then essentially collapses into a set of simple color factors that multiply contributions from color - gauge invariant subamplitudes to the given partonic process . \n one may , in fact , for convenience choose to absorb these factors into the hard - scattering functions , and _ define _ the sivers functions as the functions measured in the ssa in sidis . in this way , the net effect of the gauge links on the @xmath6-moment of the spin - dependent cross section is to generate new partonic hard - scattering functions that are different from the usual spin - independent ones , but that are actually similarly simple in structure .    at the same time , taking the moment of the factorized spin - dependent cross section leads to a new expression that involves only a certain moment of the sivers functions in partonic transverse momentum @xmath9 , rather than the fully transverse - momentum dependent functions themselves . as was shown in  @xcite , these @xmath9-moments of the sivers functions are directly related to twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions first introduced in  @xcite to describe the ssa for single - inclusive hadron production in hadronic scattering . by now , quite some knowledge about these correlation functions has been gathered from phenomenological studies  @xcite of the corresponding data . \n the upshot of all this is that it has now become possible for the first time to make predictions for the @xmath6-moment of the single - transverse spin asymmetry in dijet production at rhic that correctly take into account the process - dependence of the sivers functions and incorporate phenomenological information on some properties of the functions that is available from other measurements . \n this is the goal of this note . \n we study azimuthal correlations of two jets produced nearly `` back - to - back '' in a hadronic collision . \n more specifically , we are interested in situations in which the sum of the two jet transverse momenta , @xmath10 ( or a component or projection thereof ) , is measured and small , while both individual jet transverse momenta are large and similar . \n we will therefore approximate @xmath11 wherever possible . \n for the lengths of these momentum vectors we will simply write @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the differential cross section for the process with one transversely polarized hadron contains terms of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a unit vector in the direction of the polarized proton \n , @xmath16 is the transverse spin vector of the polarized proton , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the pseudo - rapidities of the two jets . \n the first term in eq . \n ( [ sigma ] ) represents the unpolarized ( or spin - averaged ) cross section , while the second term is the single - transverse - spin dependent one . \n we note that the angular dependence of the spin - dependent term is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the so - called bisector - angle of the two jets , which ( approximately ) corresponds to the direction of @xmath21 . for this reason one may also choose to integrate the six - fold differential cross section in eq . \n ( [ sigma ] ) over @xmath22 , keeping @xmath21 fixed .    as a generalization of the sidis and drell - yan cases @xcite , we can write down a factorization formula for the differential cross section at small imbalance ( @xmath23 ) of the jets , in terms of tmd parton distributions , soft factors , and hard - scattering functions  @xcite . \n we remind the reader that such a factorization still remains to be proven . in this paper \n , we will not discuss the details of factorization issues related to the dijet correlations . as we mentioned above \n , significant simplifications occur when the imbalance of the two jets is integrated out by taking certain moments . \n for example , integrating the spin - independent differential cross section over all @xmath21 , its expression reverts to the standard collinear factorization formula for dijet production , @xmath24 where the @xmath25 denote the usual collinear ( light - cone ) parton distribution functions for parton type @xmath26 . \n we have assumed here that these are recovered by integration of the corresponding tmd distribution functions over all partonic transverse momentum , and we disregard the renormalization properties of the operators defining these distributions and the scale dependence introduced by renormalization . \n however , all these effects can be systematically included accordingly . \n the factors @xmath27 in eq . \n ( [ jeteq ] ) are the customary hard - scattering cross sections @xmath28 for the partonic processes @xmath29 ( for a compilation , see , for example , ref . \n they are functions of the partonic mandelstam variables , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , with obvious notation of the parton momenta . in terms of the hadronic center - of - mass energy @xmath33 and the jet transverse momenta and pseudo - rapidities \n , one has @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where the partonic momentum fractions are fixed by @xmath37 , @xmath38 . \n next we turn to the single - transverse - spin dependent differential cross section @xmath39 in eq . \n ( [ sigma ] ) , which can be further simplified by taking a moment in @xmath40 where @xmath41 measures how far the two jets are away from the back - to - back configuration . within our approximations \n , the weight @xmath42 corresponds to a weight in @xmath2 . \n one finds  @xcite : @xmath43 & = & \\vert \\vec s_\\perp\\vert   \\sum_{ab } x_a\\,\\frac{-1}{m_p}\\,gt_{f\\,a}(x_a)\\,x_bf_b(x_b ) \\,h_{ab\\to cd}^{\\rm sivers}(\\hat{s},\\hat{t},\\hat{u})\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the proton mass , @xmath45 is the strong coupling constant and the @xmath46 are the qiu - sterman matrix elements or quark - gluon correlation functions @xcite , defined as @xmath47 with the quark fields @xmath48 ( for flavor @xmath49 ) and the gluon field strength tensor @xmath50 . \n the @xmath46 matrix elements enter because they are related to the @xmath9-moment of the ( sidis ) sivers function for quark flavor @xmath49 @xcite , that is , @xmath51 . \n we note that there could also be contributions by purely gluonic `` @xmath52 '' correlation functions . \n these will be ignored for now , so that the label @xmath49 in eq . \n ( [ qtmp ] ) runs only over quarks and anti - quarks . \n furthermore , there is actually a second contribution to the single - transverse - spin dependent cross section , which involves the scattering of transversely polarized quarks from both the polarized proton ( transversity distribution , @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) and from the unpolarized proton ( boer - mulders function @xmath55  @xcite ) . \n the latter functions are also effects of initial- and final - state interactions and appear in a matrix element for unpolarized protons similar to eq .  . \n like the sivers - type `` @xmath52 '' correlation functions , we will also ignore the contributions associated with the boer - mulders functions in the present study , even though a future more detailed analysis of forthcoming experimental data may well require to take all of these into account . \n we now use the above formulas to obtain some predictions for the ssa in dijet - production at rhic . \n a ssa for our @xmath59-moment ( i.e. @xmath60-moment ) can be defined as ( from now on we choose @xmath61 ) @xmath62 the quark - gluon correlation functions @xmath63 have recently been fitted  @xcite to data  @xcite for the ssa in single - inclusive hadron production in hadronic collisions . \n two sets of @xmath63 were presented in  @xcite . for definiteness , \n we choose set  i , which is a two - flavor fit with valence @xmath64 and @xmath65-quark @xmath66 distributions only . \n for these the following parameterizations were obtained in  @xcite : @xmath67 where the @xmath68 are the corresponding unpolarized valence quark distributions . for the latter , as for all other unpolarized parton distributions we need , \n we choose the cteq5l parameterizations @xcite . \n we plot the resulting weighted asymmetry in fig . \n the kinematics are chosen to correspond to current measurements at star : both jets have transverse momenta @xmath69 and pseudo - rapidities @xmath70 . \n the asymmetry is plotted as a function of the sum of the two jet pseudo - rapidities . \n we have chosen the hard scale @xmath71 in the strong coupling constant and the unpolarized parton distributions .    for comparison , we also show in fig . \n [ fig1 ] the asymmetries that one would have expected if the sivers functions relevant for dijet production were identical to the ones in sidis or the drell - yan process . in the framework of our present calculation , \n the corresponding partonic hard - scattering functions would in this case be identical to the spin - averaged functions @xmath72 , or to their negatives . \n the dotted - dashed lines in the right panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] represent these cases . \n they essentially correspond to the earlier predictions of  @xcite and  @xcite that were made when the process - dependence of the sivers functions had not yet been worked out for the dijet case . \n one can see that when the correct process - dependence is incorporated , the asymmetry overall becomes smaller by about a factor two , which can be traced back to the color factors for the dominant subprocess @xmath73 . \n the sign is identical to the case when the sivers functions for dijet production are assumed to be `` dis - like '' , implying that in a sense final - state interactions dominate over initial - state ones .    in principle \n , one might verify experimentally the process - dependence of the sivers functions by discriminating between the various curves in fig . \n [ fig1 ] and confirming the qcd - predicted result shown by the solid line . in practice \n , this may require good knowledge of the @xmath66 distributions , and an understanding of issues like scale evolution and higher - order corrections . \n a closer analysis reveals that the asymmetry in fig . \n [ fig1 ] is the result of rather significant cancellations between contributions of opposite signs by @xmath64 and @xmath65 quarks . to show this \n , we display their individual contributions separately in the left panel of fig . \n [ fig1 ] .    -0.4 \n cm    we finally also briefly discuss a related type of ssa in dijet production at rhic . in @xcite , \n a differently weighted ssa was considered , defined in the following way : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the sign function . \n this asymmetry has the property that the weight only depends on the azimuthal separation of the two jets , but not on their transverse momenta . \n this may be an advantage for experimental measurements when the jet energy scale is not precisely known . when applied to the tmd factorized expression for the spin - dependent cross section , the moment defined in eq . \n ( [ sign ] ) leads to an expression different from  ( [ qtmp ] ) . \n one finds in fact that in general the transverse - momentum dependences of the various functions do not completely decouple anymore , so that the final result can in general no longer be expressed in terms of only functions of light - cone momentum fractions . \n if one assumes for simplicity  @xcite , however , that the only relevant dependence on transverse momentum resides in the sivers functions , the resulting expression again resembles a collinearly - factorized one : @xmath76 where the @xmath77 are the so - called `` @xmath78-moments '' of the sivers functions for sidis and are defined as @xmath79 in the above equations , we have used the notation `` @xmath80 '' for the sivers function for quark flavor @xmath49 ; its definition is identical to that in @xcite : @xmath81 . in  @xcite \n , the hard - scattering functions were chosen to be the same as the spin - averaged ones , with opposite sign . in light of the above discussions , \n one now would like to update the predictions for the asymmetry in  ( [ eqan ] ) . \n we will use the @xmath56 given in eqs . \n ( [ hsivers ] ) . \n we note that it remains to be established that the same @xmath56 do contribute in this case . \n this is not a priori clear , because the general gauge link structure is very complex in the general tmd case , and it has so far only been demonstrated that the @xmath56 apply when the @xmath6 moment is taken . for \n now , we just conjecture that use of the @xmath56 of  @xcite is justified in this case ; a closer discussion of this issue is left for future work  @xcite . \n the 1/2-moments of the quark sivers functions were determined in  @xcite by a fit to the hermes data  @xcite for the sivers - type single - spin asymmetry : @xmath82 these results correspond to set  ii presented in  @xcite . in fig . \n [ fig2 ] , we show predictions for the asymmetry for the dijet - correlation defined in  ( [ eqan ] ) at rhic , based on this parameterization . we find that the asymmetry shares many features with the one shown for the @xmath59-moment in fig . \n we note that first preliminary experimental data for this asymmetry have now been presented by star  @xcite , which are so far consistent with a vanishing asymmetry .    -0.4 \n in summary , we have studied single - transverse spin asymmetries in dijet - correlations at rhic , making use of the recently derived partonic hard - scattering cross sections that properly incorporate the initial- and final - state interactions , and of distribution functions fitted to existing data for single - spin asymmetries . \n we have found that the initial- and final - state interactions tend to decrease the magnitude of the asymmetry at rhic with respect to earlier estimates that assumed the sivers functions for this observable to be identical to the sivers functions in sidis or the drell - yan process . \n overall , the resulting asymmetries turn out to be more dominated by the final - state interactions , and hence more `` dis - like '' .    with experimental data on dijet single - spin asymmetries now forthcoming , it will be interesting to perform detailed comparisons with the theoretical expectations . \n other observables , such as the ssas in dihadron production @xmath83 or in photon - plus - jet production @xmath84 , will also be extremely interesting \n . it will be important to further develop the theoretical framework for all these observables , by addressing issues like tmd factorization , higher orders , soft factors , and sudakov suppression , in particular . \n * acknowledgments . * \n we thank jan balewski and steve vigdor for valuable communications about the recent star measurements and the future prospects . \n we are also grateful to daniel boer and jianwei qiu for discussions . \n are grateful to riken , brookhaven national laboratory and the u.s . \n department of energy ( contract number de - ac02 - 98ch10886 ) for providing the facilities essential for the completion of their work . \n this work has benefited from the research program of the eu integrated infrastructure initiative hadron physics ( rii3-ct-2004 - 506078 ) . \n the work of c.b . is supported by the foundation for fundamental research of matter ( fom ) and the national organization for scientific research ( nwo ) .    for fixed - target ssa data , \n see for example : d.  l.  adams _ et al . \n _ [ e581 and e704 collaborations ] , phys \n .  lett . \n b * 261 * , 201 ( 1991 ) ;

        "abstract": "This study explores single-transverse spin asymmetries (SSAs) in azimuthal correlations of nearly back-to-back jets in proton-proton collisions at RHIC. By incorporating initial- and final-state interactions in QCD, the analysis refines predictions for SSAs using fitted distribution functions from existing data. It highlights the role of Sivers functions, their process dependence, and contributions to spin-dependent effects. These predictions, focusing on weighted asymmetries, provide a testable framework for advancing understanding of QCD spin dynamics in experimental settings."

        "article": "kingman s coalescent is a random tree introduced by @xcite as the genealogy arising in large population genetic models . \n it has infinitely many leaves and is usually constructed from leaves to the root as follows : given that there are @xmath7 lines in the tree , after some exponential time with rate @xmath8 , two lines are chosen uniformly and merged to one line , leaving the tree with @xmath9 lines . due to the quadratic rate @xmath10 the tree immediately comes down from infinitely to finitely many leaves @xcite . since the seminal paper by @xcite this random tree has been generalized to other infinite trees arising in population genetics models .    for the kingman \n coalescent some laws of large numbers and central limit theorems have been proved . \n they are nicely summarized in @xcite , chapter  4.2 ; see also proposition  [ p:11 ] below . for @xmath11 \n let @xmath12 denote the number of lines time @xmath13 in the past . \n then , since the kingman coalescent immediately comes down from infinity , @xmath12 is finite . \n furthermore it is approximately @xmath14 . \n equivalently , the time @xmath0 it takes the coalescent to go from infinitely many lines to @xmath1 lines is approximately @xmath15 for large @xmath1 . \n going to the fine structure , at time @xmath0 the infinite population is decomposed in @xmath1 families ( whose joint distribution is exchangeable ) and every leaf in the tree belongs to exactly one of the @xmath1 families whose frequencies are denoted by @xmath16 . \n it is known that for large @xmath1 a randomly chosen @xmath3 is approximately exponentially distributed with mean @xmath17 . \n this translates into several laws of large numbers ; see e.g.  ( 35 ) in @xcite . \n in particular the probability of picking ( from the initial infinite population ) two leaves that belong to the same family , given by @xmath18 , is approximately @xmath15 .    the main goal of the present paper is to study the corresponding large deviations results . to the best of our knowledge , except for @xcite , cf . \n remark  [ rem : angel ] , results in this direction are not present in the literature . \n we formulate our results in the next section . \n theorem  [ t1 ] gives a full large deviation principle for the distributions of @xmath19 . \n the proof , given in section  [ sec : proofs1 ] , is an application of the grtner - ellis theorem . as a byproduct \n , we derive a large deviation principle for the distributions of @xmath20 in corollary  [ cor : tnt ] . \n large deviations of @xmath21 are considered in theorem  [ t2 ] and exact rate functions for downwards and upwards deviations are given . the proof is given in section  [ sec : proof - theorem - reft2 ] . for the upward deviations we use a variant of cramr s theorem for heavy - tailed random variables \n ; see e.g.  @xcite . for the downward deviations we use a connection to self - normalized large deviations ; see @xcite . \n this connection was pointed out to us by alain rouault and nina gantert . \n since the rate function for downward deviations is hard to treat analytically we provide in theorem  [ t3 ] a simple lower bound . \n the proof of that bound is given in section  [ sec : proof - theorem3 ] . \n the kingman coalescent can be seen as a discrete graph , more precisely a discrete tree with infinitely many leaves . \n let @xmath22 be independent exponentially distributed variables with mean @xmath23 . \n then the kingman coalescent tree can be constructed from the root to the leaves as follows .    1 . \n start the tree with two lines from the root . \n 2 .   for @xmath24 \n the tree stays with @xmath7 lines for the amount of time @xmath25 . \n after that time one of the @xmath7 lines is randomly chosen . \n this line splits in two so that the number of lines jumps from @xmath7 to @xmath26 . \n 3 .   stop upon reaching infinitely many lines , which happens after ( the almost surely finite ) time @xmath27 . \n the random variable @xmath28 is the total tree height . \n alternatively , @xmath28 is the time to the most recent common ancestor ( mrca ) of the infinite population ( of leaves ) . counted from the top of the tree at time @xmath29 a random number @xmath12 of active lines in the kingman tree is present , i.e.@xmath30 at time @xmath0 every leaf belongs to one of @xmath1 disjoint families and all members of each such family stem from the same line at time @xmath0 . \n let us denote the frequencies of these families ( which exist due to exchangeability by definetti s theorem ) by @xmath16 . \n the following results are well known ( see @xcite for   and and @xcite for ; proofs can also be found in @xcite . )     + let [ p:11 ] @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 be as above . \n then @xmath34    we [ rem : interllnfe ] note that the left hand side of has the interpretation of a _ \n homozygosity by descent _ in the following sense : when picking two leaves from the tree at time @xmath35 , the probability that both share a common ancestor at time @xmath0 is @xmath36 . \n then , the law of large number states that the homozygosity by descent at time @xmath0 is approximately @xmath15 for large @xmath1 .    in the present paper \n we are interested in large deviations results corresponding to the statements of proposition  [ p:11 ] . \n we start with large deviations connected with . \n first we introduce some notation . for @xmath37 let @xmath38 denote the distribution of @xmath19 , \n i.e.  @xmath39 . \n furthermore we denote by @xmath40 the borel @xmath41-algebra on @xmath42 and for @xmath43 we denote by @xmath44 the _ interior _ and by @xmath45 the _ closure _ of @xmath46 . for @xmath47 , \n let @xmath48 be the unique solution of the equation @xmath49 , where the continuous and increasing function @xmath50 is defined by ( see figure  [ fig : t1 ] for a plot ) @xmath51      2 & : \\ ; t=0 , \\\\[2ex ]      \\displaystyle\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{|t|}}\\arctan\\sqrt{|t| } & : \\ ; t < 0 . \n \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the proof of the following theorem is given in section  [ sec : proof -

coroll - refc ] ; see figure  [ fig : cor1 ] for a plot of the rate function @xmath84 .    for @xmath85 \n the family @xmath86 [ cor : tnt ] satisfies a large deviation principle with scale @xmath87 and good rate function @xmath84 given by @xmath88 \\displaystyle        \\frac{\\pi^2}{2 } & : \\ ,   x=0 , \\\\[1.5ex ]        \\infty & : \\ , x<0 ,      \\end{cases }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath53 from  . \n in particular , for @xmath89 we have @xmath90     from corollary  [ cor : tnt ] . \n the figure on the right is a comparison of @xmath84 with the lower bound obtained from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   from corollary  [ cor : tnt ] . \n the figure on the right is a comparison of @xmath84 with the lower bound obtained from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    the distributions @xmath91 ( as well as @xmath92 ) have been described explicitely in the literature . \n @xcite , section 6 , gives @xmath93 in principle , this formula must also give the large deviations for the measures @xmath81 , but this does not seem straight - forward .    although [ rem : angel ] the main goal of  @xcite was the analysis of spatial @xmath94-coalescents , they also provide some large deviations bounds on kingman s coalescent . \n these bounds are mainly based on markov inequality . \n precisely , in lemma 2.2 in @xcite it is shown that for @xmath95 @xmath96 and therefore @xmath97 in the neighbourhood of @xmath98 the last inequality translates easily into a bound for the rate function @xmath84 from ; see figure  [ fig : cor1 ] . \n namely , for @xmath99 we have @xmath100    next , we state some large deviations results connected to  . for @xmath101 we know from   that @xmath102 holds almost surely . \n the proof of this result is based on the well - known fact ( see e.g.  section  5 in @xcite ) that the distribution of @xmath103 can be derived using uniform order statistics : let @xmath104 be independent and uniformly distributed on @xmath105 $ ] , and @xmath106 be their order statistics . \n additionally , let @xmath107 be independent exponentially distributed random variables with mean @xmath23 . then , @xmath108 here the second equality in distribution is one of the well known representations of uniform spacings ; see e.g.  section  4.1 in @xcite . \n it follows @xmath109 we will use this representation to obtain large deviations results for @xmath103 . in particular \n we show that upwards large deviations of @xmath103 are on the scale @xmath6 while downwards large deviations are on the scale @xmath1 . the proof is given in section  [ sec : proof - theorem - reft2 ] .    for [ t2 ] \n each @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 furthermore @xmath112 and for each @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 the function @xmath115 is positive for @xmath116 and is given by @xmath117 here @xmath118 is a function of the form @xmath119 with @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the distribution function of the one dimensional standard gaussian distribution . \n though the rate function in   is exact it is hard to treat analytically . for this reason we provide in theorem  [ t3 ] a much simpler lower bound for downwards large deviations of @xmath103 . for the proof we use the following lemma which provides another representation of @xmath103 in terms of exponential random variables ( see section  [ sec : proofs2 ] for proofs ) . \n let [ l : wn ] @xmath122 be independent exponentially distributed random variables with mean @xmath23 . \n then , @xmath123    for [ t3 ] @xmath124 we have @xmath125    the main point in the proof of lemma  [ l : wn ] is that @xmath103 does not depend on the order of the @xmath126 and hence we can as well order them according to their size . \n let us briefly explain how we will use in the proof of in . since @xmath103 is minimal if @xmath127 ( whence @xmath128 ) , we have to look for possibilities that all @xmath126 s are of about the same size in order to obtain a large deviations result for @xmath103 . \n let @xmath129 denote the above exponential random variables ordered in increasing order , i.e.  @xmath130 is the @xmath4th smallest value . \n using `` competing exponential clocks '' arguments ( see also the proof of the lemma ) one can see that @xmath131 is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath132 . hence , one way of obtaining similar values for all @xmath126 s arises if @xmath133 is particularly large , which then leads to a large deviations result for @xmath103 .     from in theorem  [ t2 ] and the lower bound from in theorem  [ t3].,width=226 ]    \\1 . \n let us give some heuristics about the rates arising in theorem  [ t2 ] . for , we have to ask ourselves about the easiest way @xmath103 \n becomes too large . from \n , we see that this is the case if one of the @xmath126 s is too large , making this kind of deviations a local property in the sense that only a single of the @xmath126 s has to show some untypical behavior . \n this is different when looking at , i.e.  too small values of @xmath103 . \n first , observe that @xmath103 is small only if all ( or many ) families have about equal sizes ( extreme case @xmath134 gives the minimal value @xmath128 ) . \n hence , such downward deviations require to study a global property of the random variable @xmath103 , which is significantly harder . \n for the proof of we will interpret @xmath103 as a self - normalised sum and use from @xcite a result on large deviations result for such sums .    \\2 . from \n , we see that in fact @xmath103 is a function of uniform order statistics , which , for instance , have been studied in detail ( although no large deviations results were given ) in @xcite . \n hence , theorem  [ t2 ] may as well be interpreted as a large deviations result for uniform order statistics .    \\3 . \n as stated in remark  [ rem : interllnfe ] , @xmath135 can be interpreted as homozygosity at time @xmath0 . using a poisson process along the tree with intensity @xmath136 , we can ask for the probability of picking two leaves from the tree which are not separated by a poisson mark , denoted by _ homozygosity in state _ , abbreviated by @xmath137 . this quantity is closely related to the poisson - dirichlet distribution and some large deviations ( in the limit of large @xmath138 ) \n were derived in @xcite . \n it is shown there in theorem  5.1 that @xmath139 and that @xmath140 for @xmath141 . however , a large deviation principle for the quantity @xmath142 ( noting that @xmath143 ) , which corresponds to the results from theorem  [ t2 ] , could not be obtained by @xcite . at least , it was shown that its scale can not be larger than @xmath144 . \n the proof of theorem  [ t1 ] is an application of the grtner - ellis theorem ; see for instance section  2.3 in @xcite . \n let @xmath145 $ ] and @xmath146 . to show that the sequence @xmath147 satisfies a large deviation principle with scale @xmath1 and a good rate function we need to check the following three conditions .    1 \n .   @xmath148 exists for all @xmath149 as a limit in @xmath150 . \n furthermore @xmath151 is lower - semicontinuous , @xmath152 , where @xmath153 . \n @xmath94 is differentiable on @xmath154 . \n 3 .   @xmath94 is _ steep _ , i.e.  @xmath155 whenever @xmath156 and @xmath157 .    then the good rate function is given by @xmath158    we proceed in three steps . \n first , we compute @xmath159 . \n second , we check the further assumptions of the grtner - ellis theorem and obtain @xmath53 as the fenchel - legendre transform of @xmath94 . in the third step , for the rate function @xmath53 from \n we obtain its simplified form given in theorem  [ t1 ] . \n the limit of @xmath160 : * we will show that @xmath161 for this , recall from that @xmath162 where @xmath163 is exponentially distributed with rate @xmath164 as well as independent of @xmath165 for all @xmath166 . \n furthermore recall that the moment generating function of an exponentially distributed random variable @xmath167 with rate @xmath168 is given by @xmath169 =    \\begin{cases }      \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda - t } , & \\text{if $ t<\\lambda$},\\\\ \\infty ,      & \\text{if $ t\\geq \\lambda$. }    \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , for each @xmath170 and @xmath171 we obtain by the monotone convergence theorem @xmath172    = \\mathbf{e}\\left[e^{t n^2 \\sum_{k = n+1}^\\infty s_k/\\binom k2}\\right ]    = \\prod_{k = n+1}^\\infty \\mathbf{e}\\left[e^{tn^2 s_k/\\binom k 2}\\right].\\ ] ] we have to consider two cases @xmath173 and @xmath174 separately . \n first suppose that @xmath175 . then there exists @xmath176 so that for all @xmath177 we have @xmath178 consequently , using , we obtain @xmath179 = \\infty$ ] for each @xmath177 . \n hence , @xmath180 and @xmath181 for @xmath1 large enough . \n thus , we have @xmath182 now suppose that @xmath183 . for @xmath184 and @xmath185 \n we have @xmath186 . furthermore using and \n we can write @xmath187 using this we can rewrite @xmath188 for @xmath189 as @xmath190 and by the dominated convergence theorem we obtain @xmath191 hence , ge1 is shown with @xmath94 as in . \n moreover , we have @xmath192 $ ] , @xmath193 and @xmath94 is lower - semi - continuous .    * step 2 . \n further assumptions of the grtner - ellis theorem : * we proceed by checking the assumptions ge2 and ge3 . for differentiability of @xmath94 for @xmath194 \n consider for @xmath195 the function @xmath196 we have @xmath197 for @xmath198 and the derivative @xmath199 exists for each @xmath200 and is continuous in @xmath149 . \n hence , we can interchange differentiation and integration and obtain @xmath201 furthermore , for a sequence @xmath202 with @xmath203 we obtain @xmath204 i.e.  condition ge3 is also satisfied .    * step 3 . \n properties of @xmath205 : * applying the grtner - ellis theorem reveals that the sequence of distributions of @xmath206 satisfies a large deviation principle with good rate function @xmath207= \\sup_{t \\leq      1 } \\left [ \\frac t2 x + \\int_1^\\infty      \\log\\left(1-\\frac{t}{y^2}\\right ) \\,\\emph dy \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to compute that supremum , we write for @xmath208 @xmath209 & = x -    2\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{y^2 - t}dy \\\\ & = x +    \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t}}\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{y+\\sqrt{t } } -    \\frac{1}{y-\\sqrt{t } } dy \\\\ & = x - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t } } \\log    \\frac{1+\\sqrt{t}}{1-\\sqrt{t}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while for @xmath210 @xmath209 & = x -    2\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{y^2 + |t|}dy \\\\ & = x -    \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{|t|}}\\arctan\\sqrt{|t|}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that the second derivative is negative throughout , such that the supremum is attained at @xmath211 given by the solution of @xmath212 for @xmath57 as in  . \n finally we note that for @xmath213 the range of @xmath214 is @xmath215 and for @xmath216 $ ] the range of @xmath217 is @xmath218 $ ] . \n hence , the scale function @xmath53 is of the form given in  .      the proof is based on the fact that @xmath219 . \n thus , for @xmath220 we have @xmath221 and for @xmath222 @xmath223 the value @xmath224 follows from  . since the rate function @xmath53 attains its minimum at @xmath58 , is decreasing below and increasing above @xmath98 , the result follows . \n when looking at , note that @xmath103 does not depend on the order of the @xmath126 s . \n therefore , it is possible to order them according to their size . precisely , let @xmath225 be their order statistics . \n then it is well - known that @xmath226 indeed , the smallest of @xmath1 independent exponentially distributed mean @xmath23 random variables is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath227 ( as does @xmath228 ) , and the second smallest then has the same distribution as @xmath229 etc . \n now , we obtain as follows @xmath230      we start by proving  . \n let @xmath110 and let @xmath231 be independent exponential random variables with mean @xmath23 . in what follows we set @xmath232 according to , it suffices to show that @xmath233 to this end we will show that for all @xmath234 , @xmath235 as well as @xmath236 and obtain by letting @xmath237 . \n for   we have @xmath238 we consider the two terms on the right hand side of the last display separately and start with the first one . \n observe that @xmath239 = \\infty$ ] for @xmath168 , @xmath240 = 2 $ ] and @xmath241 for @xmath242 . \n we use a variant of cramr s theorem for heavy -

        "abstract": "Kingman’s coalescent models genetic ancestries as a random tree structure. Key results include two laws of large numbers: (i) the shortest distance from the tree-top to when there are \n\uD835\uDC5B\nn lines is almost \n2\n/\n\uD835\uDC5B\n2/n, and (ii) individuals partition into \n\uD835\uDC5B\nn families, with family sizes following specific distributions.

        "article": "circumstellar material holds clues about the mass - loss history of massive stars . indeed , \n as the winds interact with the interstellar medium ( wind - blown bubbles , bow shocks ) , they leave a characteristic signature that depends on the wind properties . moreover , the material ejected during short eruptive phases is visible as nebulae around massive stars . \n the analysis of these features reveals which material was ejected and in which quantity . with the recent reduction in mass - loss rates , \n these episodes of enhanced mass - loss have gained more attention , as they seem more crucial than ever in the evolution of massive stars . \n another reason to study the close environment of massive stars is to better understand the evolution of supernova remnants ( snrs ) . \n indeed , the famous rings of sn1987a may only be understood if one considers the previous mass - loss episodes of the progenitor . \n morphology is not the only snr parameter which is affected , as the snr dynamics in an homogeneous medium or in winds and circumstellat ejecta is not identical .    for its study \n , the ir provides several key diagnostics . \n continuum emission in this range is provided by heated dust , which may have a range of temperatures depending of the framework ( very close hot features , large , old , and cool bubbles ) . \n in addition , ir lines probe the many phases of the material : molecules ( e.g. pahs ) for the neutral material , ionized metals for hii regions , ... \n this summary of sps5 - part iii examines each case of circumstellar environment in turn , and concludes with the potential offered by current and future facilities . \n circumstellar structures around bsgs have been predominantely identified as bow shocks around runaway stars . originally discovered with iras ( e.g. van buren & mccray , 1988 , apj , 329 , l93 ) , such structures have also been seen with msx and wise ( peri et al . \n 2012 ) . a more general survey of bsgs , i.e. not targeting runaway stars , with objects selected from crowther et al . \n ( 2006 ) and przybilla et al . \n ( 2010 ) , reveals ir material around six of the 45 targets at 22@xmath0 m with wise , also mostly in the form of bow shocks ( wachter , in prep ) . \n several examples of bipolar nebulae around bsgs are also known ( e.g. sher 25 , smartt et al . \n 2002 ; hd 168625 , smith 2007 ) . \n however , this material could have also been ejected during an lbv phase , since lbvs can exhibit bsg spectra , and we will therefore concentrate on the bow shocks . \n emission ( greyscale ) of vela x-1 with pacs 70@xmath0 m emission contours shown on top . \n _ right : _ colour composite image of bow shock of bd+43@xmath13654 ( wise 12@xmath0 m in blue , pacs 70@xmath0 m in green , and pacs 160@xmath0 m in red ) . \n the direction of proper motion is indicated by the arrow in both cases . from cox \n ( in prep.).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   emission ( greyscale ) of vela x-1 with pacs 70@xmath0 m emission contours shown on top . _ \n right : _ colour composite image of bow shock of bd+43@xmath13654 ( wise 12@xmath0 m in blue , pacs 70@xmath0 m in green , and pacs 160@xmath0 m in red ) . \n the direction of proper motion is indicated by the arrow in both cases . from cox \n ( in prep.).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    runaway stars have large stellar velocities ( above 30kms@xmath2 ) resulting from dynamical interactions in ( dense ) clusters or from a supernova explosion in a binary system . \n these stars can thus travel at supersonic speeds through the local medium giving rise to `` bow shocks '' as their stellar winds interact with the surrounding medium , which has been previously ionised by stellar photons from the hot star ( weaver 1977 ) . \n the occurrence of such bow shocks has been shown to depend primarily on the ism conditions ( huthoff & kaper 2002 ) . \n for example , even a runaway star may travel at subsonic speeds in the tenuous interior of a superbubble , where the sound speed can be as much as 100kms@xmath2 , hence no ( detectable ) bow shock will be produced in that case . \n the filling factor of ism with @xmath3kms@xmath2 is 20% and 75% of o - stars have velocities @xmath410kms@xmath2 , so the expected fraction of o - stars with bow shocks is @xmath515% . \n this is remarkably similar to the values derived from iras and wise observations ( noriega - crespo et al . \n 1997 , peri et al . \n 2012 ) . \n once formed , the size , shape and morphology of a bow shock depends on both stellar ( wind kinetic energy and stellar velocity ) and interstellar parameters ( density and temperature ) . in particular the ratio \n @xmath6 indicates whether or not instabilities are likely to develop ( dgani et al . \n 1996 ) , and the stand - off distance between the star and the apex of the shock is determined from the pressure balance between the stellar wind and the ism ( see analytical results by wilkin 1996 and simulations by e.g. comeron & kaper 1998 , blondin & koerwer 1998 ) . \n independent estimates of the wind parameters can thus be inferred from bow shocks , which serves as a useful check for atmosphere models , but the values are sensitive to the ism properties , which are not always known with precision . \n m of the dust thermal emission obtained by kervella et al . \n north is up , east to the left , and the field of view is given in the upper right corner of each image . , width=529 ]    currently , a small survey with herschel - pacs of 5 runaways with known bow - shocks is ongoing : @xmath7cam , @xmath8oph , @xmath9cma , vela x-1 and bd+43@xmath13654 ( cox et al . \n , in preparation ) . for vela x-1 , the peak emission of the dust emission is co - spatial with the most prominent h@xmath7 arc seen in the supposed direction of space motion ( fig . \n [ cox ] ) : it is concluded that the outer shock is radiative , but the inner shock is adiabatic , though some h@xmath7 emission possibly related to ( part of ) the inner termination shock is also detected . from the analysis of its \n `` puffed - up '' bow shock ( fig . \n [ cox ] ) , the mass - loss rate of bd+43@xmath13654 ( o4if ) was found to be 10@xmath10m@xmath11yr@xmath2 : this is very high ( by 2 orders of magnitude ) in view of current mass - loss rate estimates of such stars , but the exact value strongly depends on ism density , which need to be refined . \n the dust temperature , @xmath5  45  k , is compatible with heating by stellar photons only , suggesting there is no additional shock - heating of grains . \n the thickness of a bow shock ( @xmath5  1  pc ) suggests a mach number close to unity , implying a ism temperature of 10@xmath12 \n 10@xmath13  k. \n circumstellar structures on scales of a few arcseconds or less around rsgs have been revealed through interferometric techniques ( e.g. monnier et al . \n stencel et al . \n ( 1988 , 1989 ) reported the iras detection of resolved shells with typical radii of a few arcminutes around rsgs for a significant fraction ( 25% ) of their sample . \n however , higher resolution spitzer images fail to confirm several of these extended structures ( wachter , in prep ) , indicating that a systematic survey is needed to ascertain the occurrence of large scale circumstellar shells around rsgs . \n m to 192@xmath0 m . \n multitude of molecular lines have been detected . from matsuura et al . \n ( in prep.).,width=453 ]    a few ( famous ) cases have however been studied in depth . \n one of these is betelgeuse , a cool ( 3600k ) , large ( 700 r@xmath11 ) , rather massive ( 1015 m@xmath11 ) , luminous ( @xmath14 l@xmath11 ) , and nearby ( 150 pc ) star . because of its distance \n , betelgeuse can be probed on almost all scales , providing a unique panorama of stellar surroundings ( fig . \n [ betel ] ) . \n space - based and interferometric instruments ( e.g. hst , iota / ionic and vlti / pionier ) revealed the photosphere , notably the expected non - uniformities due to large convection cells . \n adaptive optics imaging in the near - ir ( e.g. naco ) and ( radio or ir ) interferometers unveiled the properties of the internal , compact molecular envelope ( 110 r@xmath15 ) . \n precursors of dust have been found there , as well as an extended `` plume '' reaching 6r@xmath15 and maybe linked to a hot spot on the photosphere . \n high - res imaging ( e.g. vlt / visir ) shows the envelope at intermediate scales ( 10100 r@xmath15 ) , where the dust forms ( a possible signature of silicates has been found ) . at these small and intermediate scales , betegeuse presents a complex circumstellar envelope ( with knots and filaments ) at all wavelengths , which implies an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the material lost by the star . \n finally , at the largest scale , ir imagers such as herschel unveil the cool external envelope ( 100 - 10000 r@xmath15 ) , where a bow shock with the ism is detected ( cox et al . \n 2012 ) . \n m ( blue ; blue contours ) and 22 @xmath0 m ( red ; yellow contours ) of ws1 , discovered and initially characterized by gvaramadze et al . \n the contours for each band help illuminate the morphology of the nebular material , which has an overall se - nw elongation , reminiscent of bipolar structure . \n _ bottom left : _ optical photometric monitoring since discovery show both the r and i light curves have brightened by about 1 magnitude over the last year . \n arrows indicate times when same night spectroscopy were secured . _ \n right panel : _ optical spectroscopic monitoring indicates evolution to cooler temperature with near disappearance of the he i 5876 @xmath16 and 6678 @xmath16 and changes in the @xmath17 line profile . \n figures from stringfellow et al . \n ( in preparation).,width=377 ]    herschel has also probed the envelope of other red supergiants ( groenewegen et al . \n turning in particular to the case of vy cma ( matsuura et al . \n , in prep . ) \n , the potential of ir spectroscopy is obvious . \n herschel - spire reveals a rich spectrum , with a dust continuum and hundreds of lines dues to molecules ( one third linked to water , others to co , cs , sio , ... ) , which constrain the envelope s properties . \n for example , the isotopic ratio @xmath18c/@xmath19c is found to be 6.5 , in agreement with observations of other rsgs but at odds with theoretical predictions which are four times higher at least . \n very strong emission of submm molecular lines can be explained if a temperature gradient is present in the envelope , e.g. because of dust formation at a certain radius . \n because of their spectacular eruptions , lbvs are the most well - known cases of massive stars with ejecta . \n it is not yet certain , however , at what stage ( bsg ? \n after a rsg phase or not ? ) this material is ejected , and how ( multiple events ? ) . \n lbvs are rare : in the list of clark et al . \n ( 2005 ) , there are only 12 confirmed and 23 candidate lbvs . \n ir has played a key role in recent years . \n the search , through surveys like mipsgal , of round - shaped nebulae with luminous central stars resulted in the discovery of many new nebulae : 62 shells in wachter et al . \n ( 2010 ) , 115 shells and bipolar nebulae in gvaramadze et al . \n ( 2010 ) , 416 structures in mizuno et al . \n many of these nebulae are preferentially detected with spitzer 24@xmath0 m band , indicating relatively cold material . \n identifying shell - like structures is only the first step . to ascertain a clbv status , \n the central object needs to be studied spectroscopically . \n this was done for many of these new detections ( c.f . \n , gvaramadze et al . 2010 ; wachter et al . 2010 ; stringfellow et al . \n 2012a , b , and in preparation ) . \n the classification does not rely on the presence of a particular line , but rather on the morphological resemblance of the spectra to spectra of known lbvs - while not 100% perfect ( some peculiar o and wr stars display similar features ) , this method has the advantage of being simple and rather robust . \n a more definitive answer can be provided through photometric and/or spectroscopic monitorings . \n indeed , as their name indicate , lbvs should be _ \n variable_. near - simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in the optical ( and ir ) of about a dozen newly identified candidate lbvs has revealed that ws1 ( discovered by gvaramadze et al . \n 2012 ) is indeed a bona fide lbv , presently displaying what appears to be s dor type variability as shown in fig . \n [ guy ] ( stringfellow et al . 2012 , in preparation ) . \n ir is also useful in revealing details of particular objects . \n for example , a herschel survey of lbvs undertaken at lige yielded as first result a characterization of the surroundings of wray 15 - 751 ( vamvatira - nakou et al . , submitted ) . \n ir photometry can only be explained if the star evolves at constant luminosity and dust grains are fe - rich . \n images also revealed the presence of a second shell , about 4 times larger than the previously known one , which most probably results from an older eruptive event . considering both structures , there is about 0.075 m@xmath11 of dust in the system . \n ionized gas is responsible for several forbidden lines observed in the herschel - pacs range ( fig . \n [ chloi ] ) , which allow a n / o abundance of about 7 times solar and a mass of ionized gas of 12 m@xmath11 ( 20 times that of dust ) , to be derived . \n dust can be well studied in the ir , so this range may provide clues on where dust come from in galaxies . \n two examples of such feedback were presented in the session : @xmath20car and sn1987a . \n the latter was observed with herschel at 100 - 500@xmath0 m wavelengths , and 0.4 - 0.7 m@xmath11 of dust was detected - mostly silicates and amorphous carbon ( matsuura et al . \n it is thought that this dust come from the explosion , but the role played by previous mass - loss episodes , in particular the lbv phase , is not yet clear . \n for example , about 0.12 m@xmath11 of dust was detected , thanks to 30@xmath0 m minitao observations , in the famous lbv @xmath20car . \n up to 80% of that dust belonged to the torus , hence may not be related to the big 1843 event . \n only a few percentage ( 4 - 6% ) of wolf - rayet stars displays surrounding nebulosities in the wise survey , and most are found around wn stars ( wachter , in prep ) . \n the morphological classification scheme of wr nebulae proposed by chu ( 1981 ) has been revised in this meeting by guerrero et al . \n ( toal et al , in prep . ) using _ wise _ ir images and sdss or super cosmos sky survey h@xmath7 images for 35 nebulae associated with wrs . \n two _ wise _ bands were particularly used : the one at 12@xmath0 m , which encompasses pah lines and lines of low excitation ions , and that at 22@xmath0 m , to which thermal emission from dust and lines of he  i as well as high excitation ions contribute . \n three phases are defined . in the first one , \n wr nebulae appear as complete shells or bubbles . \n it corresponds to the star just entering the wr stage , when its powerful wind sweeps up the previous slow and dense winds ( from e.g. lbv or rsg stages ) . \n the second phase is the clumpy phase . at that point , \n the nebulae display knots of gas and dust connected by partial shells and arcs . \n it corresponds to an age of a few 10@xmath13yr , when instabilities break down the swept - up shell . the stellar motion through the ism has an impact on the morphology , for example one - sided arc may be sometimes seen . \n finally , the mixed nebular phase ends the cycle , with no definite morphology nor always a 1-to-1 correspondence between optical and ir images . \n it corresponds to the last stage , when the circumstellar nebula begins to dissolve into the ism . \n the close environment of massive stars is the `` missing link '' between the star itself and the large circumstellar features . \n it plays a key role in understanding the mass - loss , but it is also difficult to probe directly . \n emission lines arising in the wind and circumstellar material are a classical way to study this region , as well as near - ir excess linked to disk - like features . in this context , \n be and b[e ] stars are targets of choice , and surprises are frequent . \n for example , graus et al . ( \n 2012 ) found three new sgb[e ] in the smc : they display typical spectra , with forbidden lines , but the line strengths as well as the ir excess appear reduced compared to usual objects of this class . \n it suggests that either the disks have less material or less dust than usual , or maybe that these stars are transitional objects . \n another case intriguingly shows the opposite situation : cd@xmath2149@xmath13441 displays forbidden lines and appreciable ir excess , but is a main - sequence be star away from any star - forming region ( lee and chen 2009 ) . \n a possibility may be that this star is in fact a weak b[e ] , rather than a classical be . \n the environment close to the star can also be studied , directly , by means of interferometry , which is usually performed at long wavelengths . \n most optical / ir interferometric measurements rely on the measurements of `` visibilities '' , which are directly linked to the size of the object . \n recently , several massive stars , including nine lbvs , were observed with the vlti ( groh et al . \n , in prep . ) . \n amongst these , hd316285 ( fig . \n [ groh ] ) : the recorded visibilities implied a size of 0.002  for the source of continuum radiation , and 0.004  for the source of the br@xmath22 line . \n a cmfgen fit to the spectrum yields a stellar model with which one can estimate the wind size in ir , and it agrees well with vlti observations . \n the asymetric shape of the measured differential phases ( red vs blue side ) favors a prolate shape for the rotating star wind , but it could also be explained by clumps or binarity . since \n the latter imply in time variability , a monitoring will be needed to ascertain the exact nature of the asymmetry . \n = 0.19 , rather than 0.25 as von zeipel predicted in 1924.,width=377 ]    while visibilities provide valuable data , `` real '' images are always more impressive . \n interferometric instruments such as michigan infrared combiner ( mirc ) and pionier are beginning to provide such data . \n mirc was the first to image altair ( monnier et al . \n 2007 ) and several other rapidly rotating stars as shown in fig . \n it has also imaged circumstellar disks and multi - object systems . \n for example , the disk contribution of @xmath23sco was shown to remain stable during the periastron in 2011 ( che et al . \n 2012 ) , and the mass - exchange in the @xmath24lyr system can be clearly imaged ( zhao et al . \n 2008 ) , as well as the 3 components of algol ( baron et al . 2012 ) or the disk of the eclipsing companion of @xmath25aur ( kloppenborg et al . , 2010 ) . \n this session has demonstrated the usefulness of studies in the ir in studying the environment of massive stars . \n recent advances in this domain are notably provided by surveys , as they enable discovery of new objects to study , thereby improving the census of nebular features associated with hot stars . \n furthermore , ir diagnostics unveil the properties of these neighbouring nebulosities : morphology , temperature , composition , density are the necessary keys paving the way of a better understanding of the mass - loss in massive stars . \n yn acknowledges comments from augusto daminelli and support from fnrs and prodex herschel / xmm - integral contracts . \n nljc thanks fwo and prodex - herschel for financial support . \n jhg is supported by an ambizione fellowship of the swiss national science foundation . \n cdl has been supported financially by grant nsc-101 - 2922-i-008 - 120 of the national science council of taiwan .",
        "abstract": "The study of circumstellar environments around massive stars (e.g., supergiants, Wolf-Rayet stars, and LBVs) reveals mass-loss histories and feedback mechanisms. Infrared (IR) observations are pivotal for discovering previously unknown nebulae and analyzing their morphology, temperature, and composition. Features like bow shocks, shells, and dust emission provide insights into stellar evolution and interstellar interactions. Advances in IR technology, such as Herschel and Spitzer, are enhancing our understanding of these phenomena, helping to characterize massive stars and their surrounding environments with greater detail."
