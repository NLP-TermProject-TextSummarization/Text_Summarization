        "article": "for about 20 years the problem of properties of short - term changes of solar activity has been considered extensively . \n many investigators studied the short - term periodicities of the various indices of solar activity . \n several periodicities were detected , but the periodicities about 155 days and from the interval of @xmath3 $ ] days ( @xmath4 $ ] years ) are mentioned most often . \n first of them was discovered by @xcite in the occurence rate of gamma - ray flares detected by the gamma - ray spectrometer aboard the _ solar maximum mission ( smm ) . \n this periodicity was confirmed for other solar flares data and for the same time period @xcite . \n it was also found in proton flares during solar cycles 19 and 20 @xcite , but it was not found in the solar flares data during solar cycles 22 @xcite . \n _    several autors confirmed above results for the daily sunspot area data . @xcite studied the sunspot data from 18741984 . \n she found the 155-day periodicity in data records from 31 years . \n this periodicity is always characteristic for one of the solar hemispheres ( the southern hemisphere for cycles 1215 and the northern hemisphere for cycles 1621 ) . \n moreover , it is only present during epochs of maximum activity ( in episodes of 13 years ) . \n similarinvestigationswerecarriedoutby + @xcite . \n they applied the same power spectrum method as lean , but the daily sunspot area data ( cycles 1221 ) were divided into 10 shorter time series . \n the periodicities were searched for the frequency interval 57115 nhz ( 100200 days ) and for each of 10 time series . \n the authors showed that the periodicity between 150160 days is statistically significant during all cycles from 16 to 21 . \n the considered peaks were remained unaltered after removing the 11-year cycle and applying the power spectrum analysis . \n @xcite used the wavelet technique for the daily sunspot areas between 1874 and 1993 . \n they determined the epochs of appearance of this periodicity and concluded that it presents around the maximum activity period in cycles 16 to 21 . \n moreover , the power of this periodicity started growing at cycle 19 , decreased in cycles 20 and 21 and disappered after cycle 21 . \n similaranalyseswerepresentedby + @xcite , but for sunspot number , solar wind plasma , interplanetary magnetic field and geomagnetic activity index @xmath5 . \n during 1964 - 2000 the sunspot number wavelet power of periods less than one year shows a cyclic evolution with the phase of the solar cycle.the 154-day period is prominent and its strenth is stronger around the 1982 - 1984 interval in almost all solar wind parameters . \n the existence of the 156-day periodicity in sunspot data were confirmed by @xcite . \n they considered the possible relation between the 475-day ( 1.3-year ) and 156-day periodicities . \n the 475-day ( 1.3-year ) periodicity was also detected in variations of the interplanetary magnetic field , geomagnetic activity helioseismic data and in the solar wind speed @xcite . \n @xcite concluded that the region of larger wavelet power shifts from 475-day ( 1.3-year ) period to 620-day ( 1.7-year ) period and then back to 475-day ( 1.3-year ) . \n the periodicities from the interval @xmath6 $ ] days ( @xmath4 $ ] years ) have been considered from 1968 . \n @xcite mentioned a 16.3-month ( 490-day ) periodicity in the sunspot numbers and in the geomagnetic data . \n @xcite analysed the occurrence rate of major flares during solar cycles 19 . \n they found a 18-month ( 540-day ) periodicity in flare rate of the norhern hemisphere . \n @xcite confirmed this result for the @xmath7 flare data for solar cycles 20 and 21 and found a peak in the power spectra near 510540 days . \n @xcite found a 17-month ( 510-day ) periodicity of sunspot groups and their areas from 1969 to 1986 . \n these authors concluded that the length of this period is variable and the reason of this periodicity is still not understood . \n @xcite and + @xcite obtained statistically significant peaks of power at around 158 days for daily sunspot data from 1923 - 1933 ( cycle 16 ) . in this paper the problem of the existence of this periodicity for sunspot data from cycle 16 is considered . \n the daily sunspot areas , the mean sunspot areas per carrington rotation , the monthly sunspot numbers and their fluctuations , which are obtained after removing the 11-year cycle are analysed . in section 2 the properties of the power spectrum methods are described . in section 3 a new approach to the problem of aliases in the power spectrum analysis \n is presented . in section 4 numerical results of the new method of the diagnosis of an echo - effect for sunspot area data are discussed . in section 5 the problem of the existence of the periodicity of about 155 days during the maximum activity period for sunspot data from the whole solar disk and from each solar hemisphere separately is considered . \n to find periodicities in a given time series the power spectrum analysis is applied . in this paper \n two methods are used : the fast fourier transformation algorithm with the hamming window function ( fft ) and the blackman - tukey ( bt ) power spectrum method @xcite . \n the bt method is used for the diagnosis of the reasons of the existence of peaks , which are obtained by the fft method . \n the bt method consists in the smoothing of a cosine transform of an autocorrelation function using a 3-point weighting average . \n such an estimator is consistent and unbiased . \n moreover , the peaks are uncorrelated and their sum is a variance of a considered time series . the main disadvantage of this method is a weak resolution of the periodogram points , particularly for low frequences . \n for example , if the autocorrelation function is evaluated for @xmath8 , then the distribution points in the time domain are : @xmath9 thus , it is obvious that this method should not be used for detecting low frequency periodicities with a fairly good resolution . \n however , because of an application of the autocorrelation function , the bt method can be used to verify a reality of peaks which are computed using a method giving the better resolution ( for example the fft method ) . \n it is valuable to remember that the power spectrum methods should be applied very carefully . \n the difficulties in the interpretation of significant peaks could be caused by at least four effects : a sampling of a continuos function , an echo - effect , a contribution of long - term periodicities and a random noise . \n first effect exists because periodicities , which are shorter than the sampling interval , may mix with longer periodicities . in result , this effect can be reduced by an decrease of the sampling interval between observations . \n the echo - effect occurs when there is a latent harmonic of frequency @xmath10 in the time series , giving a spectral peak at @xmath10 , and also periodic terms of frequency @xmath11 etc . \n this may be detected by the autocorrelation function for time series with a large variance . \n time series often contain long - term periodicities , that influence short - term peaks . \n they could rise periodogram s peaks at lower frequencies . \n however , it is also easy to notice the influence of the long - term periodicities on short - term peaks in the graphs of the autocorrelation functions . \n this effect is observed for the time series of solar activity indexes which are limited by the 11-year cycle .    to find statistically significant periodicities \n it is reasonable to use the autocorrelation function and the power spectrum method with a high resolution . in the case of a stationary time \n series they give similar results . \n moreover , for a stationary time series with the mean zero the fourier transform is equivalent to the cosine transform of an autocorrelation function @xcite . \n thus , after a comparison of a periodogram with an appropriate autocorrelation function one can detect peaks which are in the graph of the first function and do not exist in the graph of the second function . \n the reasons of their existence could be explained by the long - term periodicities and the echo - effect . \n below method enables one to detect these effects . \n ( solid line ) and the 95% confidence level basing on thered noise ( dotted line ) . \n the periodogram values are presented on the left axis . \n the lower curve illustrates the autocorrelation function of the same time series ( solid line ) . \n the dotted lines represent two standard errors of the autocorrelation function . \n the dashed horizontal line shows the zero level . \n the autocorrelation values are shown in the right axis . ]     because the statistical tests indicate that the time series is a white noise the confidence level is not marked . ]    . ] \n the method of the diagnosis of an echo - effect in the power spectrum ( de ) consists in an analysis of a periodogram of a given time series computed using the bt method . \n the bt method bases on the cosine transform of the autocorrelation function which creates peaks which are in the periodogram , but not in the autocorrelation function . \n the de method is used for peaks which are computed by the fft method ( with high resolution ) and are statistically significant . \n the time series of sunspot activity indexes with the spacing interval one rotation or one month contain a markov - type persistence , which means a tendency for the successive values of the time series to remember their antecendent values . \n thus , i use a confidence level basing on the red noise of markov @xcite for the choice of the significant peaks of the periodogram computed by the fft method . \n when a time series does not contain the markov - type persistence i apply the fisher test and the kolmogorov - smirnov test at the significance level @xmath12 @xcite to verify a statistically significance of periodograms peaks . the fisher test checks the null hypothesis that the time series is white noise agains the alternative hypothesis that the time series contains an added deterministic periodic component of unspecified frequency . because the fisher test tends to be severe in rejecting peaks as insignificant the kolmogorov - smirnov test is also used . \n the de method analyses raw estimators of the power spectrum . \n they are given as follows    @xmath13    for @xmath14 + where @xmath15 for @xmath16 + @xmath17 is the length of the time series @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the mean value . \n the first term of the estimator @xmath20 is constant . \n the second term takes two values ( depending on odd or even @xmath21 ) which are not significant because @xmath22 for large m. thus , the third term of ( 1 ) should be analysed . \n looking for intervals of @xmath23 for which @xmath24 has the same sign and different signs one can find such parts of the function @xmath25 which create the value @xmath20 . \n let the set of values of the independent variable of the autocorrelation function be called @xmath26 and it can be divided into the sums of disjoint sets : @xmath27 where + @xmath28 + @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 + @xmath32 + @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 \n @xmath39 @xmath40    well , the set @xmath41 contains all integer values of @xmath23 from the interval of @xmath42 for which the autocorrelation function and the cosinus function with the period @xmath43 $ ] are positive . \n the index @xmath44 indicates successive parts of the cosinus function for which the cosinuses of successive values of @xmath23 have the same sign . \n however , sometimes the set @xmath41 can be empty . \n for example , for @xmath45 and @xmath46 the set @xmath47 should contain all @xmath48 $ ] for which @xmath49 and @xmath50 , but for such values of @xmath23 the values of @xmath51 are negative . \n thus , the set @xmath47 is empty .    . \n the periodogram values are presented on the left axis . \n the lower curve illustrates the autocorrelation function of the same time series . \n the autocorrelation values are shown in the right axis . ] \n let us take into consideration all sets \\{@xmath52 } , \\{@xmath53 } and \\{@xmath41 } which are not empty . because numberings and power of these sets depend on the form of the autocorrelation function of the given time series , it is impossible to establish them arbitrary . \n thus , the sets of appropriate indexes of the sets \\{@xmath52 } , \\{@xmath53 } and \\{@xmath41 } are called @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively . for example \n the set @xmath56 contains all @xmath44 from the set @xmath57 for which the sets @xmath41 are not empty . \n to separate quantitatively in the estimator @xmath20 the positive contributions which are originated by the cases described by the formula ( 5 ) from the cases which are described by the formula ( 3 ) the following indexes are introduced : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 taking for the empty sets \\{@xmath53 } and \\{@xmath41 } the indices @xmath65 and @xmath66 equal zero . \n the index @xmath65 describes a percentage of the contribution of the case when @xmath25 and @xmath51 are positive to the positive part of the third term of the sum ( 1 ) . \n the index @xmath66 describes a similar contribution , but for the case when the both @xmath25 and @xmath51 are simultaneously negative . \n thanks to these one can decide which the positive or the negative values of the autocorrelation function have a larger contribution to the positive values of the estimator @xmath20 . \n when the difference @xmath67 is positive , the statement the @xmath21-th peak really exists can not be rejected . \n thus , the following formula should be satisfied : @xmath68    because the @xmath21-th peak could exist as a result of the echo - effect , it is necessary to verify the second condition :    @xmath69\\in c_m.\\ ] ]    . \n the periodogram values are presented on the left axis . \n the lower curve illustrates the autocorrelation function of the same time series ( solid line ) . \n the dotted lines represent two standard errors of the autocorrelation function . \n the dashed horizontal line shows the zero level . \n the autocorrelation values are shown in the right axis . ]    to verify the implication ( 8) firstly it is necessary to evaluate the sets @xmath41 for @xmath70 of the values of @xmath23 for which the autocorrelation function and the cosine function with the period @xmath71 $ ] are positive and the sets @xmath72 of values of @xmath23 for which the autocorrelation function and the cosine function with the period @xmath43 $ ] are negative . \n secondly , a percentage of the contribution of the sum of products of positive values of @xmath25 and @xmath51 to the sum of positive products of the values of @xmath25 and @xmath51 should be evaluated . as a result the indexes @xmath65 for each set \n @xmath41 where @xmath44 is the index from the set @xmath56 are obtained . \n thirdly , from all sets @xmath41 such that @xmath70 the set @xmath73 for which the index @xmath65 is the greatest should be chosen .    the implication ( 8) is true when the set @xmath73 includes the considered period @xmath43 $ ] . \n this means that the greatest contribution of positive values of the autocorrelation function and positive cosines with the period @xmath43 $ ] to the periodogram value @xmath20 is caused by the sum of positive products of @xmath74 for each @xmath75-\\frac{m}{2k},[\\frac{2m}{k}]+\\frac{m}{2k})$ ] .    when the implication ( 8) is false , the peak @xmath20 is mainly created by the sum of positive products of @xmath74 for each @xmath76-\\frac{m}{2k},\\big [ \\frac{2m}{n}\\big ] + \\frac{m}{2k } \\big ) $ ] , where @xmath77 is a multiple or a divisor of @xmath21 . \n it is necessary to add , that the de method should be applied to the periodograms peaks , which probably exist because of the echo - effect . \n it enables one to find such parts of the autocorrelation function , which have the significant contribution to the considered peak . \n the fact , that the conditions ( 7 ) and ( 8) are satisfied , can unambiguously decide about the existence of the considered periodicity in the given time series , but if at least one of them is not satisfied , one can doubt about the existence of the considered periodicity . \n thus , in such cases the sentence the peak can not be treated as true should be used .    using the de method \n it is necessary to remember about the power of the set @xmath78 . \n if @xmath79 is too large , errors of an autocorrelation function estimation appear . \n they are caused by the finite length of the given time series and as a result additional peaks of the periodogram occur . if @xmath79 is too small , there are less peaks because of a low resolution of the periodogram . in applications \n @xmath80 is used . in order to evaluate the value \n @xmath79 the fft method is used . \n the periodograms computed by the bt and the fft method are compared . \n the conformity of them enables one to obtain the value @xmath79 .    . \n the fft periodogram values are presented on the left axis . \n the lower curve illustrates the bt periodogram of the same time series ( solid line and large black circles ) . \n the bt periodogram values are shown in the right axis . ] \n in this paper the sunspot activity data ( august 1923 - october 1933 ) provided by the greenwich photoheliographic results ( gpr ) are analysed . \n firstly , i consider the monthly sunspot number data . to eliminate the 11-year trend from these data , \n the consecutively smoothed monthly sunspot number @xmath81 is subtracted from the monthly sunspot number @xmath82 where the consecutive mean @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 the values @xmath83 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 are calculated using additional data from last six months of cycle 15 and first six months of cycle 17 .    because of the north - south asymmetry of various solar indices @xcite , the sunspot activity is considered for each solar hemisphere separately . \n analogously to the monthly sunspot numbers , the time series of sunspot areas in the northern and southern hemispheres with the spacing interval @xmath87 rotation are denoted . in order to find periodicities , \n the following time series are used : + @xmath88 \n + @xmath89 \n + @xmath90     + in the lower part of figure [ f1 ] the autocorrelation function of the time series for the northern hemisphere @xmath88 is shown . \n it is easy to notice that the prominent peak falls at 17 rotations interval ( 459 days ) and @xmath25 for @xmath91 $ ] rotations ( [ 81 , 162 ] days ) are significantly negative . \n the periodogram of the time series @xmath88 ( see the upper curve in figures [ f1 ] ) does not show the significant peaks at @xmath92 rotations ( 135 , 162 days ) , but there is the significant peak at @xmath93 ( 243 days ) . \n the peaks at @xmath94 are close to the peaks of the autocorrelation function . \n thus , the result obtained for the periodicity at about @xmath0 days are contradict to the results obtained for the time series of daily sunspot areas @xcite .    for the southern hemisphere ( the lower curve in figure [ f2 ] ) @xmath25 for @xmath95 $ ] rotations ( [ 54 , 189 ] days ) is not positive except @xmath96 ( 135 days ) for which @xmath97 is not statistically significant . \n the upper curve in figures [ f2 ] presents the periodogram of the time series @xmath89 . \n this time series does not contain a markov - type persistence . \n moreover , the kolmogorov - smirnov test and the fisher test do not reject a null hypothesis that the time series is a white noise only . \n this means that the time series do not contain an added deterministic periodic component of unspecified frequency . \n the autocorrelation function of the time series @xmath90 ( the lower curve in figure [ f3 ] ) has only one statistically significant peak for @xmath98 months ( 480 days ) and negative values for @xmath99 $ ] months ( [ 90 , 390 ] days ) . \n however , the periodogram of this time series ( the upper curve in figure [ f3 ] ) has two significant peaks the first at 15.2 and the second at 5.3 months ( 456 , 159 days ) . \n thus , the periodogram contains the significant peak , although the autocorrelation function has the negative value at @xmath100 months .    to explain \n these problems two following time series of daily sunspot areas are considered : + @xmath101 \n + @xmath102     + where @xmath103    the values @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 are calculated using additional daily data from the solar cycles 15 and 17 .     and the cosine function for @xmath45 ( the period at about 154 days ) . \n the horizontal line ( dotted line ) shows the zero level . \n the vertical dotted lines evaluate the intervals where the sets @xmath107 ( for @xmath108 ) are searched . \n the percentage values show the index @xmath65 for each @xmath41 for the time series @xmath102 ( in parentheses for the time series @xmath101 ) . in the right bottom corner \n the values of @xmath65 for the time series @xmath102 , for @xmath109 are written . ] \n ( the 500-day period ) ]    the comparison of the functions @xmath25 of the time series @xmath101 ( the lower curve in figure [ f4 ] ) and @xmath102 ( the lower curve in figure [ f5 ] ) suggests that the positive values of the function @xmath110 of the time series @xmath101 in the interval of @xmath111 $ ] days could be caused by the 11-year cycle . \n this effect is not visible in the case of periodograms of the both time series computed using the fft method ( see the upper curves in figures [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] ) or the bt method ( see the lower curve in figure [ f6 ] ) . moreover , the periodogram of the time series @xmath102 has the significant values at @xmath112 days , but the autocorrelation function is negative at these points . \n @xcite showed that the lomb - scargle periodograms for the both time series ( see @xcite , figures 7 a - c ) have a peak at 158.8 days which stands over the fap level by a significant amount . using the de method the above discrepancies are obvious . to establish the @xmath79 value the periodograms computed by the fft and \n the bt methods are shown in figure [ f6 ] ( the upper and the lower curve respectively ) . \n for @xmath46 and for periods less than 166 days there is a good comformity of the both periodograms ( but for periods greater than 166 days the points of the bt periodogram are not linked because the bt periodogram has much worse resolution than the fft periodogram ( no one know how to do it ) ) . for @xmath46 and @xmath113 \n the value of @xmath21 is 13 ( @xmath71=153 $ ] ) . \n the inequality ( 7 ) is satisfied because @xmath114 . \n this means that the value of @xmath115 is mainly created by positive values of the autocorrelation function . \n the implication ( 8) needs an evaluation of the greatest value of the index @xmath65 where @xmath70 , but the solar data contain the most prominent period for @xmath116 days because of the solar rotation . \n thus , although @xmath117 for each @xmath118 , all sets @xmath41 ( see ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ) without the set @xmath119 ( see ( 4 ) ) , which contains @xmath120 $ ] , are considered . this situation is presented in figure [ f7 ] . in this figure \n two curves @xmath121 and @xmath122 are plotted . \n the vertical dotted lines evaluate the intervals where the sets @xmath107 ( for @xmath123 ) are searched . for such @xmath41 two numbers \n are written : in parentheses the value of @xmath65 for the time series @xmath101 and above it the value of @xmath65 for the time series @xmath102 . to make this figure clear the curves are plotted for the set @xmath124 only . \n ( in the right bottom corner information about the values of @xmath65 for the time series @xmath102 , for @xmath109 are written . ) \n the implication ( 8) is not true , because @xmath125 for @xmath126 . \n therefore , @xmath43=153\\notin c_6=[423,500]$ ] . \n moreover , the autocorrelation function for @xmath127 $ ] is negative and the set @xmath128 is empty . \n thus , @xmath129 . on the basis of these information one can state , that the periodogram peak at @xmath130 days of the time series @xmath102 exists because of positive @xmath25 , but for @xmath23 from the intervals which do not contain this period . \n looking at the values of @xmath65 of the time series @xmath101 , one can notice that they decrease when @xmath23 increases until @xmath131 . \n this indicates , that when @xmath23 increases , the contribution of the 11-year cycle to the peaks of the periodogram decreases . \n an increase of the value of @xmath65 is for @xmath132 for the both time series , although the contribution of the 11-year cycle for the time series @xmath101 is insignificant . \n thus , this part of the autocorrelation function ( @xmath133 for the time series @xmath102 ) influences the @xmath21-th peak of the periodogram . \n this suggests that the periodicity at about 155 days is a harmonic of the periodicity from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] days . \n ( solid line ) and consecutively smoothed sunspot areas of the one rotation time interval @xmath134 ( dotted line ) . \n both indexes are presented on the left axis . \n the lower curve illustrates fluctuations of the sunspot areas @xmath135 . \n the dotted and dashed horizontal lines represent levels zero and @xmath136 respectively . \n the fluctuations are shown on the right axis . ] \n the described reasoning can be carried out for other values of the periodogram . \n for example , the condition ( 8) is not satisfied for @xmath137 ( 250 , 222 , 200 days ) . \n moreover , the autocorrelation function at these points is negative . \n these suggest that there are not a true periodicity in the interval of [ 200 , 250 ] days . \n it is difficult to decide about the existence of the periodicities for @xmath138 ( 333 days ) and @xmath139 ( 286 days ) on the basis of above analysis . the implication ( 8) is not satisfied for @xmath139 and the condition ( 7 ) is not satisfied for @xmath138 , although the function @xmath25 of the time series @xmath102 is significantly positive for @xmath140 . \n the conditions ( 7 ) and ( 8) are satisfied for @xmath141 ( figure [ f8 ] ) and @xmath142 . therefore , it is possible to exist the periodicity from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] days . \n similar results were also obtained by @xcite for daily sunspot numbers and daily sunspot areas . \n she considered the means of three periodograms of these indexes for data from @xmath143 years and found statistically significant peaks from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] ( see @xcite , figure 2 ) . \n @xcite studied sunspot areas from 1876 - 1999 and sunspot numbers from 1749 - 2001 with the help of the wavelet transform . \n they pointed out that the 154 - 158-day period could be the third harmonic of the 1.3-year ( 475-day ) period . \n moreover , the both periods fluctuate considerably with time , being stronger during stronger sunspot cycles . \n therefore , the wavelet analysis suggests a common origin of the both periodicities . this conclusion confirms the de method result which indicates that the periodogram peak at @xmath144 days is an alias of the periodicity from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] \n in order to verify the existence of the periodicity at about 155 days i consider the following time series : + @xmath145     + @xmath146 \n + @xmath147 \n + the value @xmath134 is calculated analogously to @xmath83 ( see sect . \n the values @xmath148 and @xmath149 are evaluated from the formula ( 9 ) . in the upper part of figure [ f9 ] the time series of sunspot areas @xmath150 of the one rotation time interval from the whole solar disk and the time series of consecutively smoothed sunspot areas @xmath151 \n are showed . in the lower part of figure [ f9 ] \n the time series of sunspot area fluctuations @xmath145 is presented . \n on the basis of these data the maximum activity period of cycle 16 is evaluated . \n it is an interval between two strongest fluctuations e.a . \n @xmath152 $ ] rotations . \n the length of the time interval @xmath153 is 54 rotations . \n if the about @xmath0-day ( 6 solar rotations ) periodicity existed in this time interval and it was characteristic for strong fluctuations from this time interval , 10 local maxima in the set of @xmath154 would be seen . \n then it should be necessary to find such a value of p for which @xmath155 for @xmath156 and the number of the local maxima of these values is 10 . \n as it can be seen in the lower part of figure [ f9 ] this is for the case of @xmath157 ( in this figure the dashed horizontal line is the level of @xmath158 ) . \n figure [ f10 ] presents nine time distances among the successive fluctuation local maxima and the horizontal line represents the 6-rotation periodicity . \n it is immediately apparent that the dispersion of these points is 10 and it is difficult to find even few points which oscillate around the value of 6 . \n such an analysis was carried out for smaller and larger @xmath136 and the results were similar . \n therefore , the fact , that the about @xmath0-day periodicity exists in the time series of sunspot area fluctuations during the maximum activity period is questionable .    . \n the horizontal line represents the 6-rotation ( 162-day ) period . ]    ]    ]    to verify again the existence of the about @xmath0-day periodicity during the maximum activity period in each solar hemisphere separately , the time series @xmath88 and @xmath89 were also cut down to the maximum activity period ( january 1925december 1930 ) . \n the comparison of the autocorrelation functions of these time series with the appriopriate autocorrelation functions of the time series @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are computed for the whole 11-year cycle ( the lower curves of figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) , indicates that there are not significant differences between them especially for @xmath23=5 and 6 rotations ( 135 and 162 days ) ) . \n this conclusion is confirmed by the analysis of the time series @xmath146 for the maximum activity period . \n the autocorrelation function ( the lower curve of figure [ f11 ] ) is negative for the interval of [ 57 , 173 ] days , but the resolution of the periodogram is too low to find the significant peak at @xmath159 days . \n the autocorrelation function gives the same result as for daily sunspot area fluctuations from the whole solar disk ( @xmath160 ) ( see also the lower curve of figures [ f5 ] ) . in the case of \n the time series @xmath89 @xmath161 is zero for the fluctuations from the whole solar cycle and it is almost zero ( @xmath162 ) for the fluctuations from the maximum activity period . \n the value @xmath163 is negative . \n similarly to the case of the northern hemisphere the autocorrelation function and the periodogram of southern hemisphere daily sunspot area fluctuations from the maximum activity period @xmath147 are computed ( see figure [ f12 ] ) . \n the autocorrelation function has the statistically significant positive peak in the interval of [ 155 , 165 ] days , but the periodogram has too low resolution to decide about the possible periodicities . \n the correlative analysis indicates that there are positive fluctuations with time distances about @xmath0 days in the maximum activity period . \n the results of the analyses of the time series of sunspot area fluctuations from the maximum activity period are contradict with the conclusions of @xcite . \n she uses the power spectrum analysis only . \n the periodogram of daily sunspot fluctuations contains peaks , which could be harmonics or subharmonics of the true periodicities . \n they could be treated as real periodicities . \n this effect is not visible for sunspot data of the one rotation time interval , but averaging could lose true periodicities . \n this is observed for data from the southern hemisphere . \n there is the about @xmath0-day peak in the autocorrelation function of daily fluctuations , but the correlation for data of the one rotation interval is almost zero or negative at the points @xmath164 and 6 rotations . \n thus , it is reasonable to research both time series together using the correlative and the power spectrum analyses . \n the following results are obtained :    1 . \n a new method of the detection of statistically significant peaks of the periodograms enables one to identify aliases in the periodogram . \n 2 .   two effects cause the existence of the peak of the periodogram of the time series of sunspot area fluctuations at about @xmath0 days : the first is caused by the 27-day periodicity , which probably creates the 162-day periodicity ( it is a subharmonic frequency of the 27-day periodicity ) and the second is caused by statistically significant positive values of the autocorrelation function from the intervals of @xmath165 $ ] and @xmath166 $ ] days . \n the existence of the periodicity of about @xmath0 days of the time series of sunspot area fluctuations and sunspot area fluctuations from the northern hemisphere during the maximum activity period is questionable . \n the autocorrelation analysis of the time series of sunspot area fluctuations from the southern hemisphere indicates that the periodicity of about 155 days exists during the maximum activity period . \n i appreciate valuable comments from professor j. jakimiec .",
        "abstract": "The study investigates short-term periodicities in sunspot area fluctuations between 1923 and 1933. A 155-day periodicity is identified, often considered a harmonic of longer cycles. Analysis reveals this periodicity in the southern hemisphere during solar cycle 16’s peak activity, but not consistently in the northern hemisphere. A new diagnostic method addresses echo effects in power spectrum analysis, highlighting challenges in confirming true periodicities. These findings emphasize the complexity of short-term solar activity patterns and the importance of careful statistical analysis."

        "article": "it is believed that the direct detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) will bring the era of gravitational wave astronomy . \n the interferometer detectors are now under operation and awaiting the first signal of gws  @xcite . \n it is also known that pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) can be used as a detector for gws @xcite . \n these detectors are used to search for very low frequency ( @xmath0 ) gravitational waves , where the lower limit of the observable frequencies is determined by the inverse of total observation time @xmath1 . \n indeed , the total observation time has a crucial role in ptas , because ptas are most sensitive near the lower edge of observable frequencies @xcite . taking into account its sensitivity , \n the first direct detection of the gravitational waves might be achieved by ptas . \n the main target of ptas is the stochastic gravitational wave background ( sgwb ) generated by a large number of unresolved sources with the astrophysical origin or the cosmological origin in the early universe . \n the promising sources are super massive black hole binaries  @xcite , cosmic ( super)string  @xcite , and inflation  @xcite . \n previous studies have assumed that the sgwb is isotropic and unpolarized  @xcite . \n these assumptions are reasonable for the primary detection of the sgwb , but the deviation from the isotropy and the polarizations should have rich information of sources of gravitational waves . \n recently , the cross - correlation formalism has been generalized to deal with anisotropy in the sgwb @xcite . \n result of this work enables us to consider arbitrary levels of anisotropy , and a bayesian approach was performed by using this formalism @xcite . on the other hand , for the anisotropy of the sgwb , the cross - correlation formalism has been also developed in the case of interferometer detectors  @xcite . \n as to the polarization , there are works including the ones motivated by the modified gravity  @xcite \n . we can envisage supermassive black hole binaries emit circularly polarized sgwb due to the chern - simons term  @xcite . \n there may also exist cosmological sgwb with circular polarization in the presence of parity violating term in gravity sector  @xcite .    in this paper \n , we investigate the detectability of circular polarization in the sgwb by ptas . \n we characterize sgwb by the so called stokes @xmath2 parameter  @xcite and calculate generalized overlap reduction functions ( orfs ) so that we can probe the circular polarization of the sgwb . \n we also discuss a method to separate the intensity ( @xmath3 mode ) and circular polarization ( @xmath2 mode ) of the sgwb . \n the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : \n stokes parameters for a plane gravitational wave ] , we introduce the stokes parameters for monochromatic plane gravitational waves , and clarify the physical meaning of the stokes parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in section [ sec : formulation ] , we formulate the cross - correlation formalism for anisotropic circularly polarized sgwb with ptas . \n the basic framework is essentially a combination of the formalism of @xcite , and the polarization decomposition formula of the sgwb derived in @xcite . in section [ sec : the generalized overlap reduction function for circular polarization ] , we calculate the generalized orfs for the @xmath2 mode . \n the results for @xmath3 mode are consistent with the previous work  @xcite . in section [ sec : separation method ] , we give a method for separation between the @xmath3 mode and @xmath2 mode of the sgwb . \n the final section is devoted to the conclusion . in appendixes , we present analytic results for the generalized overlap reduction functions . in this paper \n , we will use the gravitational units @xmath4 . \n let us consider the stokes parameters for plane waves traveling in the direction @xmath5 , which can be described by @xmath6 \\ \n , \\\\ & & h_{xy}(t , z)=h_{yx}(t , z)={\\rm re}[b_{\\times}\\mathrm{e}^{-iw(t -

as @xmath22 from the above expression , we see that the real parameter @xmath2 characterizes the asymmetry of circular polarization amplitudes . \n the other parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 have additional information about linear polarizations by analogy with the electromagnetic cases . \n alternatively , we can also define the tensor @xmath25 in circular polarization bases @xmath26 where @xmath27 . \n note that the stokes parameters satisfy a relation @xmath28    next , we consider the transformation of the stokes parameters under rotations around the @xmath5 axis . the rotation around the @xmath5 axis is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angle of the rotation . \n the gws traveling in the direction @xmath5 @xmath31 transform as @xmath32 where we took the transverse traceless gauge @xmath33 after a short calculation , we obtain @xmath34 using and , the four stokes parameters ( [ sti])-([stv ] ) transform as @xmath35 as you can see , the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 depend on the rotation angle @xmath30 . \n this reflects the fact that @xmath23 and @xmath24 parameters characterize linear polarizations . \n note that this transformation is similar to the transformation of electromagnetic case except for the angle @xmath36 and can be rewritten as @xmath37 \n in this section , we study anisotropic distribution of sgwb and focus on the detectability of circular polarizations with pulsar timing arrays . \n we combine the analysis of @xcite and that of @xcite . in sec.[subsec : the spectral ] , we derive the power spectral density for anisotropic circularly polarized sgwb @xmath38 . \n then we also derive the dimensionless density parameter @xmath39 which is expressed by the frequency spectrum of intensity @xmath40  @xcite . in sec.[subsec : the signal ] , we extend the generalized orfs to cases with circular polarizations characterized by the parameter @xmath2 . for simplicity , \n we consider specific anisotropic patterns with @xmath41 expressed by the spherical harmonics @xmath42 .      in the transverse traceless gauge , metric perturbations @xmath43 with a given propagation direction @xmath44 \n can be expanded as @xcite @xmath45 where the fourier amplitude satisfies @xmath46 as a consequence of the reality of @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the frequency of the gws , @xmath49 are spatial indices , @xmath50 label polarizations . \n note that the fourier amplitude @xmath51 satisfies the relation @xmath52 where @xmath53 was defined by . \n the polarized tensors @xmath54 are defined by @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are unit orthogonal vectors perpendicular to @xmath58 . \n the polarization tensors satisfy @xmath59 with polar coordinates , the direction @xmath44 can be represented by @xmath60 and the polarization basis vectors read @xmath61    we assume the fourier amplitudes @xmath62 are random variables , which is stationary and gaussian . \n however , they are not isotropic and unpolarized . \n the ensemble average of fourier amplitudes can be written as @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 here , the bracket @xmath65 represents an ensemble average , and @xmath66 is the dirac delta function on the two - sphere . \n the gw power spectral density @xmath38 is a hermitian matrix , and satisfies @xmath67 because of the relation @xmath46 . \n therefore , we have the relations @xmath68 note that the stokes parameters are not exactly the same as the expression of , but they have the relation and characterize the same polarization . \n we further assume that the sgwbs satisfy @xmath69 we also assume the directional dependence of the sgwb is frequency independent @xcite . \n this implies the gw power spectral density is factorized into two parts , one of which depends on the direction while the other depends on the frequency . \n because of the transformations - , the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 have spin 0 and the parameters @xmath70 have spin @xmath71  @xcite . to analyze the sgwb on the sky , it is convenient to expand the stokes parameters by spherical harmonics @xmath72 \n . however , since @xmath70 parameters have spin @xmath71 , they have to be expanded by the spin - weighted harmonics @xmath73 @xcite . \n thus , we obtain @xmath74 in this paper , we study specific anisotropic patterns with @xmath41 for simplicity . \n therefore , we can neglect @xmath23 and @xmath24 from now on . \n thus , the gw power spectral density becomes @xmath75 where @xmath76 so , we focus on the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in what follows , we will use the following shorthand notation @xmath77    next , we consider the dimensionless density parameter  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the critical density , @xmath80 is the present value of the hubble parameter , @xmath81 is the energy density of gravitational waves , and @xmath82 is the energy density in the frequency range @xmath48 to @xmath83 . \n the bracket @xmath65 represents the ensemble average . \n however , actually , we take a spatial average over the wave lengths @xmath84 of gws or a temporal average over the periods @xmath85 of gws . here \n , we assumed the ergodicity , namely , the ensemble average can be replaced by the temporal average . \n using , , , as well as @xmath46 and @xmath86 , we get @xmath87 then we define @xmath88 hence , the dimensionless quantity @xmath39 in is given by @xmath89 where the spherical harmonics are orthogonal and normalized as @xmath90 using @xmath91 , we obtain @xmath92 without loss of generality , we normalize the monopole moment as @xmath93 so , becomes @xmath94      the time of arrival of radio pulses from the pulsar is affected by gws . \n consider a pulsar with frequency @xmath95 located in the direction @xmath96 . to detect the sgwb , \n let us consider the redshift of the pulse from a pulsar @xcite @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a frequency detected at the earth and @xmath96 is the direction to the pulsar . \n the unit vector @xmath44 represents the direction of propagation of gravitational plane waves . \n we also defined the difference between the metric perturbations at the pulsar @xmath99 and at the earth @xmath100 as @xmath101 the gravitational plane waves at each point is defined as @xmath102 for the sgwb , the redshift have to be integrated over the direction of propagation of the gravitational waves @xmath44 : @xmath103 we choose a coordinate system @xmath104 and assume that the amplitudes of the metric perturbation at the pulsar and the earth are the same . \n then becomes @xmath105 and therefore , reads @xmath106 where we have defined the pattern functions for pulsars @xmath107 note that our convention for the fourier transformation is @xmath108 therefore , the fourier transformation of can be written as @xmath109    in the actual signals from a pulsar , there exist noises . \n hence , we need to use the correlation analysis . \n we consider the signals from two pulsars @xmath110 where @xmath111 labels the pulsar . here \n , @xmath112 denotes the signal from the pulsar and @xmath113 denotes the noise intrinsic to the measurement . \n we assume the noises are stationary , gaussian and are not correlated between the two pulsars . \n to correlate the signals of two measurements , we define @xmath114 where @xmath1 is the total observation time and @xmath115 is a real filter function which should be optimal to maximize signal - to - noise ratio . in the case of interferometer \n , the optimal filter function falls to zero for large @xmath116 compered to the travel time of the light between the detecters . \n since the signals of two detectors are expected to correlate due to the same effect of the gravitational waves , the optimal filter function should behave this way . \n then , typically one of the detectors is very close to the other compared to the total observation time @xmath1 . \n therefore , the total observation time @xmath1 can be extended to @xmath117 @xcite . \n in contrast , in the case of pta , it is invalid that @xmath1 is very large compered to the travel time of the light between the pulsars . \n nevertheless , we can assume that one of the two @xmath1 can be expanded to @xmath117 , because in situations @xmath118 and @xmath119 it is known that we can ignore the effect of the distance @xmath120 of pulsars . \n in this case , it is clear that any locations of the pulsars are optimal and optimal filter function should behave like as the interferometer case @xcite .    using these assumptions @xmath118 and @xmath119 , we can rewrite as @xmath121 where @xmath122 note that @xmath123 satisfies @xmath124 , because @xmath125 is real . \n moreover , to deal with the unphysical region @xmath126 we require @xmath127 . \n thus , @xmath123 becomes real . \n taking the ensemble average , using @xmath128 , @xmath118 , and assuming the noises in the two measurements are not correlated , we get @xmath129\\ , \\label{s2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath130 the functions @xmath131 and @xmath132 are called the generalized orfs , which describe the angular sensitivity of the pulsars for the sgwb . note that , as we already mentioned , we consider the cases of @xmath41 for simplicity \n . then we have assumed @xmath118 and @xmath119 , this assumption implies that approximately becomes @xmath133 due to the rapid oscillation of the phase factor . \n therefore , the distance @xmath120 of the pulsars does not appear in the generalized orfs , and hence the generalized orfs do not depend on the frequency .    as you can see from , \n the correlation of the two measurements involve both the total intensity and the circular polarization . \n however , the degeneracy can be disentangled by using separation method , which will be discussed in the section [ sec : separation method ] . \n in this section , we consider the generalized orfs for circular polarizations : @xmath134 where we defined @xmath135 in the above , we have used and the fact that the generalized orfs do not depend on frequency . for computation of the generalized orfs for circular polarizations , \n it is convenient to use the computational frame @xcite defined by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the angular separation between the two pulsars . using - , , and \n , one can easily show that @xmath138 we therefore get @xmath139 the explicit form of the spherical harmonics reads @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the normalization factor . \n the associated legendre functions are given by @xmath142 and @xmath143 with the legendre functions @xmath144\\ .\\label{pl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the spherical harmonics , becomes @xmath145 where we have used the fact that the function of @xmath146 is odd parity in the case of @xmath147 and is even parity in the case of @xmath148 . \n note that the generalized orfs for circular polarizations are real functions . in the case of @xmath149 and/or @xmath150 , \n the integrand in vanishes . \n therefore , we can not detect circular polarizations for these cases . \n this fact for @xmath151 implies that we do not need to consider auto - correlation for a single pulsar . \n this is the reason why we neglected auto - correlation term in .    integrating , \n we get the following form for @xmath152 : @xmath153 for @xmath154 , we have obtained @xmath155 \\ , \\\\ \\gamma^{v}_{1 -

        "abstract": "This study examines the potential to detect circular polarization in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) using pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). While circular polarization cannot be observed in an isotropic SGWB, it becomes detectable if the background is anisotropic. The paper introduces generalized overlap reduction functions for analyzing circular polarization and presents methods to distinguish polarized waves from unpolarized ones. This research could offer insights into sources like supermassive black hole binaries, cosmic strings, and early-universe inflation."

        "abstract": "A new barrier penetration formula, derived from the WKB approximation, accounts for the long-range Coulomb interaction, making it effective for low-energy penetrations below the Coulomb barrier. The formula provides accurate penetrability calculations and closely matches WKB results. Applied to alpha-decay half-life evaluations for atomic nuclei, it demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data, particularly for spherical nuclei. This formula enhances the study of barrier penetrability in nuclear processes and fusion reactions."

        "article": "the short - lived radioisotope ( slri ) @xmath4al was alive during the formation of the first refractory solids in the solar nebula , the ca- , al - rich inclusions ( cais ) found in primitive chondritic meteorites . \n this means that at least some of the solar system s slris may have been injected into either the presolar cloud ( e.g. , boss & keiser 2012 ; boss 2012 ) or the solar nebula ( ouellette et al . 2007 , 2010 ; dauphas & chaussidon 2011 ) by a supernova or agb star shock wave . in either case , \n injection occurred as a single event that was spatially heterogeneous , which would potentially reduce the usefulness of @xmath4al as a spatially homogeneous chronometer ( dauphas & chaussidon 2011 ) for precise studies of the earliest phases of planet formation ( macpherson et al . \n 2012 ; cf . \n krot et al . \n previous models ( e.g. , boss 2011 , 2012 ) have shown how such initial spatial isotopic heterogeneity can be substantially reduced in a marginally gravitationally unstable ( mgu ) disk , as a result of the large - scale inward and outward transport and mixing of gas and particles small enough to move with the gas ( e.g. , boss et al . \n 2012 ) . other elements and their isotopes suggest a similarly well - mixed solar nebula ( e.g. , os : walker 2012 ; fe : \n wang et al . 2013 ) . \n the stable oxygen isotopes , on the other hand , appear to have been spatially heterogeneous in the solar nebula during the early phases of planet formation ; e.g. , small refractory particles from comet 81p / wild 2 have normalized @xmath5o/@xmath6o ratios that span the entire solar system range of @xmath0 6% variations ( nakashima et al . 2012 ) . \n the leading explanation for generating these oxygen anomalies is uv photodissociation of co molecules at the surface of the outer solar nebula ( e.g. , podio et al . \n 2013 ) , where self - shielding could lead to isotopic fractionation between gas - phase and solid - phase oxygen atoms ( e.g. , lyons & young 2005 ; krot et al . \n co self - shielding on the irregular , corrugated outer surface of the disk would also lead to initial spatial heterogeneity , though the process would be continuous in time , rather than a single - shot event like a supernova shock wave . \n furthermore , the very existence of refractory particles in comet 81p / wild 2 ( brownlee et al . 2006 ; simon et al . 2008 ; nakamura et al . \n 2008 ) , which are thought to have formed close to the protosun , implies that these small particles experienced large - scale outward transport from the inner solar nebula to the comet - forming regions of the outer solar nebula . \n mgu disks offer a means to accomplish this early large - scale transport ( e.g. , boss 2008 , 2011 ; boss et al . \n 2012 ) . \n marginally gravitationally unstable disks are likely to be involved in the fu orionis outbursts experienced by young solar - type stars ( e.g. , zhu et al . 2010b ; vorobyov & basu 2010 ; martin et al . \n mgu disk models ( e.g. , boss 2011 ) can easily lead to the high mass accretion rates ( @xmath7 yr@xmath8 ) needed to explain fu orionis events . \n fu orionis outbursts are believed to last for about a hundred years and to occur periodically for all low mass protostars ( hartmann & kenyon 1996 ; miller et al . \n mgu models are also capable of offering an alternative mechanism ( disk instability ) for gas giant planet formation ( e.g. , boss 2010 ; meru & bate 2012 ; basu & vorobyov 2012 ) . \n however , the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) is likely to be involved in fu orionis outbursts as well ( zhu et al . \n 2009a ) , with mri operating in the ionized innermost disk layers as well as at the disk s surfaces . \n zhu et al . ( 2009c , 2010a , b ) have constructed one- and two - dimensional ( axisymmetric ) models of a coupled mgu - mri mechanism , with mgu slowly leading to a build - up of mass in the innermost disk , which then triggers a rapid mri instability and an outburst . \n alternatively , mri may operate in the outermost disk , partially ionized by cosmic rays , leading to a build - up of mass in the dead zone at the intermediate disk midplane , thus triggering a phase of mgu transport . \n such a coupled mechanism may be crucial for achieving outbursts in t tauri disks , where the disk masses are expected to be smaller than at earlier phases of evolution . \n we present here several new sets of mgu disk models that examine the time evolution of isotopic heterogeneity introduced in either the inner or outer solar nebula , by either a single - shot event or a continuous injection process , for a variety of disk and central protostar masses , including protostars with m dwarf masses . \n low mass exoplanets are beginning to be discovered around an increasingly larger fraction of m dwarfs ( bonfils et al . \n 2013 ; dressing & charbonneau 2013 ; kopparapu 2013 ) , with a number of these being potentially habitable exoplanets , elevating the importance of understanding mixing and transport processes in m dwarf disks . \n the numerical models were computed with the same three dimensional , gravitational hydrodynamics code that has been employed in previous mgu disk models ( e.g. , boss 2011 ) . \n complete details about the code and its testing may be found in boss & myhill ( 1992 ) . \n briefly , the code performs second - order - accurate ( in both space and time ) hydrodynamics on a spherical coordinate grid , including radiative transfer in the diffusion approximation . \n a spherical harmonic ( @xmath9 ) expansion of the disk s density distribution is used to compute the self - gravity of the disk , with terms up to and including @xmath10 . \n the radial grid contains 50 grid points for the 10 au disk models and 100 grid points for the 40 au disk models . \n all models have 256 azimuthal grid points , and effectively 45 theta grid points , given the hemispherical symmetry of the grid . \n the theta grid is compressed around the disk s midplane to provide enhanced spatial resolution , while the azimuthal grid is uniformly spaced . \n the jeans length constraint is used to ensure adequate resolution . \n the inner boundary absorbs infalling disk gas , which is added to the central protostar , while the outer disk boundary absorbs the momentum of outward - moving disk gas , while retaining the gas on the active grid . \n the central protostar wobbles in such a manner as to preserve the center of mass of the entire system . \n the time evolution of a color field is calculated ( e.g. , boss 2011 ) in order to follow the mixing and transport of isotopes carried by the disk gas or by small particles , which should move along with the disk gas . \n the equation for the evolution of the color field density @xmath11 ( e.g. , boss 2011 ) is identical to the continuity equation for the disk gas density @xmath12    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the disk gas velocity and @xmath15 is the time . \n the total amount of color is conserved in the same way that the disk mass is conserved , as the hydrodynamic equations are solved in conservation law form ( e.g. , boss & myhill 1992 ) . \n the initial disk density distributions are based on the approximation derived by boss ( 1993 ) for a self - gravitating disk orbiting a star with mass @xmath16    @xmath17 @xmath18,\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are cylindrical coordinates , @xmath21 is the gravitational constant , @xmath22 is the midplane density , @xmath23 is the surface density , @xmath24 ( cgs units ) and @xmath25 . \n the initial midplane density is    @xmath26    while the initial surface density is    @xmath27    the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 and the reference radius @xmath30 are defined in table 1 for the various disk models explored in this paper . \n the total amount of mass in the models does not change during the evolutions ; the initial infalling disk envelope accretes onto the disk , and no further mass is added to the system across the outer disk boundary at @xmath31 . \n the outer disk surfaces are thus revealed to any potential source of uv irradiation .    for the 10 au outer radius disks listed in tables 2 and 3 , the initial disk temperature profiles \n ( figures 1 and 2 ) are based on the boss ( 1996 ) temperature profiles , with variations in the assumed outer disk temperature @xmath32 , chosen in order to study the effect of varied minimum values of the @xmath2 stability parameter . \n values of @xmath33 indicate marginally gravitationally unstable disks . \n the inner disks are all highly @xmath2 stable , with @xmath34 . \n for the 40 au outer radius disks listed in table 4 , the initial disk temperatures are uniform at the specified outer disk temperature @xmath32 , leading to similar initial @xmath2 values throughout the disks . \n for all of the models , the temperature of the infalling envelope is 50 k.    the initial color field is added to the surface of the initial disk in an azimuthal sector spanning either 45 degrees ( 10 au outer radius disks ) or 90 degrees ( 40 au outer radius disks ) in a narrow ring of width 1 au , centered at the injection radii listed in the tables . \n these models are intended to represent one - time , single - shot injections of isotopic heterogeneity , such as supernova - induced rayleigh - taylor fingers carrying live @xmath4al ( e.g. , boss & keiser 2012 ) . table 4 lists both single - shot and continuous injection models , where in the latter case the color is added continuously to the same location on the disk surface throughout the evolution , crudely simulating ongoing photodissociation of co ( e.g. , lyons & young 2005 ) possibly leading to stable oxygen isotope fractionation between the gas and solid phases . \n the color field in the latter case is intended to represent isotopically distinct gas or small particles resulting from the uv photochemistry . \n note that in both the single - shot and continuous injection models , the total amount of color added is arbitrary ( e.g. , the color field in the injection volume is simply set equal to 1 ) , and is intended to be scaled to whatever value is appropriate for the isotope(s ) under consideration . \n the color field is a massless , passive tracer that has no effect on the disk s dynamics , so the total amount of color added is irrelevant for the disk s subsequent evolution . \n the models seek to follow the deviations from uniformity of the color field , not the absolute amounts of color added ; the evolution of the dispersion of the color field about its mean radial value , divided by the mean radial value at each instant of time , is the goal of these models . \n observations of the dg tau disk by podio et al . \n ( 2013 ) have shown that dg tau itself irradiates its disk s outer layers from 10 au to 90 au with a strong uv flux , sufficient for significant uv photolysis and the formation of observable water vapor . \n much higher levels of uv irradiation can occur for protoplanetary disks that form in stellar clusters containing massive stars ( e.g. , walsh et al . \n 2013 ) , an environment that has been suggested for our own solar system ( e.g. , dauphas & chaussidon 2011 ) in order to explain the evidence for live slris found in primitive meteorites . \n the fact that molecular hydrogen constitutes the great majority of a disk s mass , yet can not be directly detected , except at the star - disk boundary region , means that estimates of disk masses are uncertain at best ( e.g. , andrews & williams 2007 ) , as they are typically based on an assumed ratio between the amount of mm - sized dust grains and the total disk mass . \n isella et al . \n ( 2009 ) estimated that low- and intermediate - mass pre - main - sequence stars form with disk masses ranging from 0.05 to 0.4 @xmath1 . \n dg tau s disk has a mass estimated to be as high as 0.1 @xmath1 ( podio et al . \n recently , the mass of the tw hydra disk was revised upward to at least 0.05 @xmath1 ( bergin et al . \n 2013 ) . these and other observations suggest that the mgu disk masses assumed in these models may be achieved in some fraction of protoplanetary disks , and perhaps in the solar nebula as well . \n in fact , miller et al . ( \n 2011 ) detected a fu orionis outburst in the classical t tauri star lkh@xmath35 188-g4 . \n disk masses are typically thought to be @xmath36 for such stars . \n the fact that a fu orionis event occurred in lkh@xmath35 188-g4 shows that even the disks around class ii - type objects can experience instabilities leading to rapid mass accretion , e.g. , mgu disk phases . \n we present results for a variety of protostellar and protoplanetary disk masses , varied initial minimum @xmath2 stability parameters , and varied injection radii , for disks of two different sizes . \n table 2 shows the initial conditions for the models with a @xmath37 disk in orbit around a @xmath38 protostar . \n the disks extend from 1 au to 10 au , as in the models by boss ( 2008 , 2011 ) . \n the main difference from these previous models is that the disk mass ( @xmath37 ) is considerably lower than that of the previous models ( @xmath39 ) . as a result , \n the initial minimum @xmath2 values are considerably higher than in the previous models , ranging from 2.2 to 3.1 , compared to the previous range of 1.4 to 2.5 . \n the present models are thus less gravitationally unstable initially than the disks previously considered , with the goal being to learn whether or not the previous results will change for higher values of @xmath40 . \n figure 1 displays the initial midplane temperature profiles for these models . \n only the outermost regions of the disks are cool enough to be gravitationally unstable , but the models show that this is sufficient to result in qualitatively similar behavior for all of the table 2 models \n .    figures 3 and 4 show the equatorial plane distribution of the color / gas ratio ( @xmath41 ) for model 1.0 - 2.6 - 9 . \n this ratio is plotted , as it is equivalent to the @xmath4al/@xmath42al and @xmath5o/@xmath6o ratios measured by cosmochemists , i.e. , the abundance of an injected or photolysis product species , divided by that of a species that was prevalent in the pre - injection disk . \n figure 3 shows that the initial disk surface injection at 9 au has resulted in the rapid transport of the color field downward to the disk s midplane , as well as inward to close to the inner disk boundary at 2 au . \n the vigorous three dimensional motions of a mgu disk are responsible for this large - scale transport in just 34 yr . at this time \n , the color / gas ratio is still highly heterogeneous , but figure 4 shows that only 146 yr later , the color / gas ratio has been strongly homogenized throughout the entire disk midplane . \n figure 5 shows the evolution of the dispersion of the ratio of the color density to the gas density for models 1.0 - 2.6 - 9 and 1.0 - 2.6 - 2 at two times . \n these models differ only in the injection radius , either 9 au or 2 au . \n the dispersion plotted in figure 5 is defined to be the square root of the sum of the squares of the color field divided by the gas density , subtracted by the azimuthal average of this ratio at a given orbital radius , divided by the square of the azimuthal average at that radius , normalized by the number of azimuthal grid points , and plotted as a function of radius in the disk midplane . \n figure 5 shows that the isotopic dispersion is a strong function of orbital radius and time , with the dispersion initially being relatively large ( i.e. , at 180 yr , in spite of the apparent homogeneity seen in figure 4 at the same time ) as a result of the isotopes traveling downward and radially inward and outward . \n however , the dispersion decreases dramatically in the outer disks for both models by 777 yr to a value of @xmath0 1% to 2% . \n in fact , the dispersion in both models 1.0 - 2.6 - 9 and 1.0 - 2.6 - 2 evolves toward essentially the same radial distribution by this time , showing that the exact location of the injection location has little effect on the long term evolution of the distribution : that is controlled solely by the evolution of the underlying mgu disk , which is identical for these two models ( i.e. , the color fields are passive tracers , and have no effect on the disk s evolution ) . \n note that any small refractory grains present in the initial disk will be carried along with the disk gas , so that some of the grains that start out at 2 au will be transported to the outermost disk , in the same manner that some of the gas is transported outward . \n most of the gas and dust , however , is accreted by the growing protostar . \n figure 6 shows the results for three models with varied @xmath40 , i.e. , models 1.0 - 2.6 - 9 , 1.0 - 2.9 - 9 , and 1.0 - 3.1 - 9 , all after 1370 yr . \n it can be seen that in spite of the variation in the initial degree of instability , the dispersions in the outermost disks all converge to similar values of @xmath0 1% to 2% . \n this suggests that mgu disk evolutions are not particularly sensitive to the exact choice of the initial @xmath2 profile , a result that was also found by boss ( 2011 ) for somewhat more massive disks . \n as also found by boss ( 2011 ) , the dispersions in the innermost disks are significantly higher ( @xmath0 10% to 20% ) than in the outermost disks , a direct result of the stronger mixing associated with the cooler outer disks , in spite of the longer orbital periods in the outer disks . \n table 3 shows the initial conditions for the models with either @xmath43 disks around @xmath44 protostars , or @xmath45 disks around @xmath46 protostars . in either case \n , the disks extend from 1 au to 10 au . \n these models are of interest for exploring how conditions might vary between disks around g dwarfs and m dwarfs , with possible ramifications for the habitability of any rocky planets that form ( e.g. , raymond et al . 2007 ) around m dwarfs . \n figure 2 shows the initial midplane temperature profiles for these models . \n figure 7 shows the time evolution of the dispersion for model 0.1 - 1.8 - 2 , appropriate for a late m dwarf protostar . as in all the models \n , it can be seen that the initially highly heterogeneous disk becomes rapidly homogenized , in this case by about 5000 yr . \n note that this time scale is considerably longer than that for g dwarf disk mixing and transport processes , as a result of the longer keplerian orbital periods for lower mass , m dwarf protostars . \n as in the g dwarf protostar models ( e.g. , figure 5 ) , the inner disk dispersion is higher than in the outer disk , though in these models ( with a lower initial @xmath47 ) the inner disk dispersion drops to @xmath0 5% to 10% , compared to @xmath0 1% to 2% in the outer disk . \n figure 8 shows the same behavior for model 0.1 - 1.8 - 9 , which differs from the previous model shown in figure 7 only in having the injection occur at 9 au instead of 2 au . as in the g dwarf disks , \n the dispersions for both of these models evolve toward essentially identical radial distributions : the underlying mgu disk evolution determines the outcome for the dispersions . \n similar results hold for the models with @xmath46 protostars , i.e. , early m dwarf disks . \n we now turn to a consideration of the consequence of single - shot versus continuous injection at the surface of much larger outer radius ( 40 au ) disks than have been considered to date for g dwarf stars ; boss ( 2007 ) considered disks extending from 4 au to 20 au in radius . \n table 4 shows the initial conditions for the models with a @xmath48 disk around a @xmath38 protostar , with the disks extending from 10 au to 40 au . because of the much larger inner and outer disk radii for this set of models , \n these models can be calculated for times as long as @xmath49 yr ( table 4 ) . \n such times are still considerably less than the typical ages ( @xmath50 yr ) of t tauri stars , implying that in order for mgu disks to occur at such late phases , a prior phase of coupled mri - mgu evolution might be required to make the present results relevant .    figures 9 and 10 display the evolution of the dispersions for models 1.0 - 1.1 - 40 - 20 and 1.0 - 1.1 - 40 - 20c , differing only in that the former model has single - shot injection while the latter model has continuous injection , intended to simulate a disk with ongoing uv photolysis and fractionation at the outer disk surface . for model 1.0 - 1.1 - 40 - 20 \n , it can be seen that the evolution is similar to that of the previous single - shot models : a rapid drop in the dispersion , followed by homogenization to @xmath0 1% to 2% away from the inner disk boundary . \n the higher dispersions seen near the outer disk boundaries ( @xmath0 40 au ) are largely caused by the unphysical pile - up of considerable disk mass at 40 au and should be discounted . however , for the continuous injection model shown in figure 10 , it can be seen that the dispersions throughout the disk even after @xmath3 yr can be as high as @xmath0 20% , consistent with the much larger variation in stable oxygen isotope ratios , compared to slri ratios . in a calculation with finer spatial grid resolution , as well as perhaps sub - grid mixing processes , one might expect even stronger homogenization to occur , so the dispersion levels obtained from the present models should be considered to be upper bounds . \n the total amount of color added during the continuous injection models is large , compared to single - shot injection models : for model 1.0 - 1.4 - 40 - 20c , for example , after 200 yr , the total amount of color injected has increased by a factor of @xmath0 90 compared to the single - shot total , and by another factor of @xmath0 60 after 27000 yr . \n figures 11 and 12 compare the results for continuous injection at either 20 au or 30 au , respectively , i.e. , for models 1.0 - 1.1 - 40 - 20c and 1.0 - 1.1 - 40 - 30c . in spite of the different injection radii , figures 11 and 12 \n show that even at a relatively early phase ( 405 yr ) of evolution , the midplane color / gas ratios look somewhat similar ; as before , the mgu disk evolution is the same for both models , and that is the primary determinant of the long term evolution .    finally , similar results as those shown in figures 9 - 12 were obtained for the other models listed in table 4 . \n these models show that the main factor in determining the radial dispersion profile is whether the injection occurs in a single - shot or continuously ; in the latter case , the mgu disk does its best to homogenize the color field , but the fact that spatial heterogeneity is being continuously injected limits the degree to which this heterogeneity can be reduced . \n while dust grains in the interstellar medium are overwhelmingly amorphous , crystalline silicate grains have been found in a late m dwarf ( sst - lup3 - 1 ) disk at distances ranging from inside 3 au to beyond 5 au , in both the midplane and surface layers ( mern et al . \n such crystalline silicate grains are likely to have been produced by thermal annealing in the hottest regions of the disk , well inside of 1 au ( sargent et al . \n 2009 ) . again \n , outward transport seems to be required to explain the observations , and the results for the models with a 0.1 @xmath1 protostar suggest that mgu phases in low mass m dwarf disks may be responsible for these observations . in fact , crystalline mass fractions in protoplanetary disks do not appear to correlate with stellar mass , luminosity , accretion rate , disk mass , or the disk to star ratio ( watson et al . \n these results also appear to be consistent with the results of the present models , which show that mgu disk phases are equally capable of relatively rapid large - scale mixing and transport , regardless of the stellar or disk mass , or the exact value of the @xmath2 stability parameter . \n these models have shown a rather robust result , namely that a phase of marginal gravitational instability in disks and stars with a variety of masses and disk temperatures can lead to relatively rapid inward and outward transport of disk gas and small grains , as required to drive the protostellar mass accretion associated with fu orionis events , as well as to explain the discovery of refractory grains in comet 81p / wild 2 . \n a mgu disk phase driving a fu orionis outburst is astronomically quite likely to have occurred for our protosun , and cosmochemically convenient for explaining the relative homogeneity of @xmath4al/@xmath42al ratios derived from a supernova injection event , and the range of @xmath5o/@xmath6o ratios derived from sustained uv self - shielding at the surface of the outer solar nebula . \n low - mass stars , from g dwarfs to m dwarfs , may well experience a similar phase of mgu disk mixing and transport . in this context , it is worthwhile to note that fu orionis itself , the prototype of the fu orionis outburst phenomenon , has a mass of only @xmath51 ( zhu et al . \n 2007 , 2009b ; beck & aspin 2012 ) , i.e. , the mass of a m dwarf , suggesting that m dwarf protoplanetary disks may experience evolutions similar to that of the solar nebula , with possible implications for the habitability of any resulting planetary system ( e.g. , raymond et al . 2007 ; bonfils et al . 2013 ; dressing & charbonneau 2013 ; kopparapu 2013 ) . \n i thank jeff cuzzi for his comments , the referee for a number of suggested improvements , and sandy keiser , michael acierno , and ben pandit for their support of the cluster computing environment at dtm . \n this work was partially supported by the nasa origins of solar systems program ( nnx09af62 g ) and is contributed in part to the nasa astrobiology institute ( nna09da81a ) . \n some of the calculations were performed on the carnegie alpha cluster , the purchase of which was partially supported by a nsf major research instrumentation grant ( mri-9976645 ) . \n 1.0 & 0.019 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & 1.0 & 1.0 & 10.0 + 0.5 & 0.018 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & 1.0 & 1.0 & 10.0 + 0.1 & 0.016 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & 1.0 & 1.0 & 10.0 + 1.0 & 0.13 & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & 4.0 & 10.0 & 40.0 +      1.0 -

        "abstract": "The study explores marginally gravitationally unstable (MGU) disks in young stars, analyzing their role in mixing and transporting materials during the solar system's formation. MGU disks rapidly homogenize short-lived isotopes within ~1,000 years, while stable oxygen isotopes retain ~10% heterogeneity due to continuous UV photolysis. These findings suggest the protosun likely experienced FU Orionis-like outbursts, aiding in the large-scale transport of refractory grains and isotopes, as evidenced in meteorites and comet samples. The models examine disks of varied mass and stability around stars of differing masses, confirming their role in solar system material distribution."

fig . \n [ fig_dijet ] shows the fractional difference between the data and the fit ( @xmath22 ) . \n we note upward fluctuations near 200 gev / c@xmath1 ( @xmath23 ) , 550 gev / c@xmath1 ( @xmath24 ) and 850 gev / c@xmath1 ( @xmath25 ) .    for narrow resonances \n it is sufficient to determine the mass resolution for only one type of new particle because the detector resolution dominates the width . in fig . \n [ fig_resonance ] we show the mass resolution for excited quarks ( q * ) from pythia plus a cdf detector simulation ; the long tail at low mass comes from gluon radiation . for each value of new particle mass in 50 gev / c@xmath1 steps , \n we perform a binned maximum likelihood fit of the data to the background parameterization and the mass resonance shape . in fig . \n [ fig_resonance ] we display the best fit and 95% confidence level upper limit for a 550 gev / c@xmath1 resonance . for the mass region @xmath26 \n gev / c@xmath1 , there are 2947 events in the data , @xmath27 events ( @xmath28 ) in the background for the fit without a resonance , @xmath29 events ( @xmath30 ) in the background for the fit that includes the resonance , and the value of the resonance cross section from the fit is @xmath31 pb ( statistical ) .    in fig . \n [ fig_cos ] we study the angular distribution of the fluctuation in the mass region @xmath26 gev / c@xmath1 . \n the angular distribution is compatible with both qcd alone , and with    = 3.3 in = 3.3 in    qcd + 5% excited quark ( best fit ) . \n this amount of excited quark is coincidentally the same as found in the mass fit . \n although the fluctuation is interesting , we conclude it is not yet    = 3.3 in = 3.3 in    statistically significant , and proceed to set limits on new particle production . \n = 3.3 in = 3.3 in    from the likelihood distribution including experimental systematic uncertainties  @xcite we obtain the 95% cl upper limit on the cross section for new particles shown in fig . \n [ fig_dijet_limit ] . \n we compare this to the cross section for axigluons ( excluding @xmath32 gev / c@xmath1 ) , excited quarks ( excluding @xmath33 gev / c@xmath1 ) , technirhos ( excluding @xmath34 gev / c@xmath1 ) , w@xmath35 ( excluding @xmath36 gev / c@xmath1 ) , z@xmath35 ( excluding @xmath37 gev / c@xmath1 ) , and e6 diquarks ( excluding @xmath38 gev / c@xmath1 ) . \n the calculations are lowest order  @xcite using cteq2l parton distributions  @xcite and one - loop @xmath39 and require @xmath16 and @xmath40 . \n the large mass of the top quark suggests that the third generation may be special . \n topcolor  @xcite assumes that the top mass is large mainly because of a dynamical @xmath5 condensate generated by a new strong dynamics coupling to the third generation . here \n the @xmath41 of qcd is a low energy symmetry arising from the breaking of an @xmath42 coupling to the third generation and an @xmath43 coupling to the first two generations only . \n there are then massive color octet bosons , topgluons @xmath44 , which couple largely to @xmath4 and @xmath5 . \n the topgluon is strongly produced and decays mainly to the third generation ( @xmath45 ) with a relatively large natural width ( @xmath46 ) . \n here we search for the topgluon in the @xmath4 channel . \n an additional @xmath47 symmetry is introduced  @xcite to keep the @xmath48 quark light while the top quark is heavy ; this leads to a topcolor @xmath6 , which again couples largely to @xmath4 and @xmath5 . \n the topcolor @xmath6 is electroweakly produced and decays mainly to the third generation ( @xmath49 ) with a narrow natural width ( @xmath50 ) . \n here we search for the topcolor @xmath6 in both the the @xmath4 and @xmath5 channel ; the @xmath5 channel is the most sensitive because the coupling to @xmath5 is larger . \n we start with the dijet search in 19 pb@xmath0 of run 1a data  @xcite and additionally require at least one of the two leading jets be tagged as a bottom quark . \n the b - tag requires a displaced vertex in the the secondary vertex detector  @xcite . \n the @xmath4 event efficiency is @xmath51% independent of dijet mass . from fits to the @xmath52 distribution \n , we estimate that the sample is roughly 50% bottom , 30% charm , and 20% mistags of plain jets . \n pythia predicts that 1/5 of these bottom quarks are direct @xmath4 , and the rest are from gluon splitting and flavor excitation . \n consequentially , only about @xmath53% @xmath54 10% of our sample is direct @xmath4 . \n we expect both the purity and efficiency to increase when we use the run 1b dataset and a new tagging algorithm  @xcite \n . with higher tagging efficiency we should be able to make better use of double b - tagged events like the one in fig . \n [ fig_btag_event ] . \n = 2.6 in = 2.6 in    in fig . \n [ fig_btag ] we show the b - tagged dijet mass distribution corrected for the @xmath4 efficiency . \n also shown is the untagged dijet mass distribution from run 1a , and both are well fit with our standard parameterization  @xcite . \n the b - tagged dijet data has an upward fluctuation near 600 gev / c@xmath1 . \n we model the shape of a narrow resonance using pythia z@xmath3 production and a cdf detector simulation . in fig . \n [ fig_btag ] we fit the b - tagged data to a 600 gev / c@xmath1 narrow resonance , and find a cross section of @xmath55 pb ( statistical ) . \n note that this is comparable to the dijet fluctuation in both mass and rate . however , there are only 8 events in the last two data bins of fig . \n [ fig_btag ] , and the fluctuation is only a @xmath56 effect , so we proceed to set limits on new particle production . \n we perform two kinds of fits for the limits . \n first , narrow resonances are modelled as described above , and the mass resolution in the cdf detector is shown in fig . \n [ fig_b_bbar_res ] . \n second , wide resonances characteristic of topgluons  @xcite , including interference with normal gluons , was incorporated into pythia and a cdf detector simulation . the mass resolution in fig . \n [ fig_b_bbar_res ] displays destructive interference to the left of the resonance ; models with destructive interference on the right side of the resonance will be considered in the future . \n = 3.2 in = 3.2 in    limits on new particle production are shown in fig . \n [ fig_btag_limit ] . \n the theoretical cross sections are lowest order and use cteq2l parton distributions . for narrow resonances the production cross sections are nt large enough for us to set mass limits at this time . for topgluons \n the production cross sections  @xcite are larger , and we are able to exclude at 95% cl topgluons of width @xmath57 in the mass region @xmath58 gev / c@xmath1 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 gev / c@xmath1 , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 gev / c@xmath1 .    = 3.0 in = 3.0 in    = 7.7 in \n to search for new particles decaying to @xmath5 we start with the data sample from the top mass measurement  @xcite . \n there we used top decays to w + four jets with at least one b - tag , and found 19 events on a background of @xmath63 , resulting in a top mass of @xmath64(stat)@xmath65(sys ) gev / c@xmath1 . that analysis fit the entire event for the top hypothesis , discarding events with @xmath66 ( poor fit ) . \n here we add the additional constraint that the top mass is 176 gev / c@xmath1 , which significantly enhances our resolution of the @xmath5 mass . \n two of the 19 events fail the @xmath66 cut when the top mass constraint is added to the fit , leaving us with 17 events . \n the @xmath5 mass distribution expected from a narrow resonance , normalized to the topcolor @xmath6 predicted rate  @xcite , is shown in fig . \n [ fig_ttbar ] . \n here we used pythia @xmath67 . \n also in fig . \n [ fig_ttbar ] is the monte carlo distribution of the background , on the left standard model top production from herwig , and on the right qcd w + jets background from vecbos with parton showers from herwig . \n all monte carlos include a cdf detector simulation . on the left in fig . \n [ fig_ttbar ] , the comparison of the topcolor z@xmath3 to sm @xmath5 simulations illustrates that in this data sample we are sensitive to topcolor @xmath6 up to a mass of roughly 600 gev / c@xmath1 . finally , on the right in fig . \n [ fig_ttbar ] , we present the @xmath5 candidate mass distribution from cdf compared to the total standard model prediction . given the statistics the agreement is quite good overall . \n the small shoulder of 6 events on a background of @xmath68 in the region @xmath69 gev / c@xmath1 is in an interesting mass region , given the dijet and @xmath4 search results , but is not statistically significant . \n upper limits on the @xmath5 cross section as a function of @xmath5 mass , and on a topcolor @xmath6 , are currently in progress . \n = 3.1 in = 3.1 in \n we have searched for new particles decaying to dijets , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . in the dijet channel we set the most significant direct mass exclusions to date on the hadronic decays of axigluons ( excluding @xmath70 gev / c@xmath1 ) , excited quarks ( excluding @xmath71 gev / c@xmath1 ) , technirhos ( excluding @xmath34 gev / c@xmath1 ) , w@xmath3 ( excluding @xmath36 gev / c@xmath1 ) , z@xmath35 ( excluding @xmath37 gev / c@xmath1 ) , and for the first time e6 diquarks ( excluding @xmath38 gev / c@xmath1 ) . in the @xmath4 channel \n we set the first limits on topcolor , excluding a model of topgluons for width @xmath57 in the mass region @xmath58 gev / c@xmath1 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 gev / c@xmath1 , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 gev / c@xmath1 . \n the search for topcolor in the @xmath5 channel has just begun and limits are in progress . \n limits are only a consolation prize ; the main emphasis of our search is to explore the possibility of a signal . although we do not have significant evidence for new particle production , the @xmath72 gev / c@xmath1 region shows upward fluctuations in all three channels . \n we can not ignore the exciting possibility that these apparently separate fluctuations may be the first signs of a new physics beyond the standard model . \n the remaining integrated luminosity for run 1b , currently being accumulated and analyzed , has the potential to either kill the fluctuations or reveal what may be the most interesting new physics in a generation . \n +    f. abe et al . \n ( cdf ) , phys . \n lett . * 74 * , 3538 ( 1995 ) . \n p. frampton and s. glashow , phys . \n b190 * , 157 ( 1987 ) . \n u. baur et al . , int . j. mod . \n phys a2 , 1285(1987 ) & pr*d42 * , 815(1990 ) . \n k. lane et al . \n , pr*d44 * , 2768(1991 ) & phys . lett . \n * b327 * , 129(1994 ) . \n j. hewett and t. rizzo , phys . rep . \n * 183 * , 193 ( 1989 ) . \n talk by anwar bhatti in these proceedings . \n parameterization @xmath73 with parameters a , n and p. for new gauge bosons we use a k - factor to account for higher order terms . \n j. botts et al . \n ( cteq collaboration ) phys . lett . * \n b304 * , 159 ( 1993 ) . c. hill and s. parke , phys \n . rev . * d49 * , 4454 ( 1994 ) . c. hill , phys . \n b345 * , 483 ( 1994 ) . \n f. abe et al . \n ( cdf ) , phys . rev . * \n d50*,2966 ( 1994 ) . \n f. abe et al . \n ( cdf ) , phys . \n lett . * 74 * , 2626 ( 1995 ) . \n we model the interference between normal gluons and topgluons using hybrid model c in phys . rev . * d49 * , 4454 ( 1994 ) . \n g. burdman , c. hill , and s. parke private communication .",
        "abstract": "CDF searched for new particles decaying into jets and heavy quarks. They observed a small excess of events near 550–600 GeV/c², possibly signaling exotic particles like axigluons, technirhos, or topcolor bosons, but not at a significant level. They set strong limits on various candidates, excluding several mass ranges. While no definitive new physics emerged, the hints remain intriguing. Further data and analysis could clarify whether these fluctuations are just random or the first signs of something new."

        "article": "this review focuses specifically on what we have learned about the progenitors of core - collapse supernovae ( cc  sne ) by examining images of the supernova ( sn ) sites taken prior to the explosion . by registering pre - sn and post - sn images , usually taken at high resolution using either space - based optical detectors , or ground - based infrared detectors equipped with laser guide star adaptive optics systems ( lgs - ao ) , about one dozen cc sn progenitors have now been directly detected ( i.e. , shown to be spatially coincident with the sn ) in pre - sn images , with roughly two dozen upper limits derived from non - detections @xcite . \n this field has come a long way in the last decade , and promises to advance rapidly as more and more nearby galaxies  hosts of future cc sne  have high - resolution images added to the archive . \n this review is organized as follows . following a brief summary of sn classification and stellar evolution theory (   2 ) , one example from each of the following three categories of progenitor studies \n is provided (   3 ; ordered from most - to - least common ) : ( 1 ) no progenitor star detected in pre - sn image(s ) ; ( 2 ) likely progenitor star identified via spatial coincidence in pre - sn and post - sn images ; ( 3 ) progenitor star detected in pre - sn image(s ) and subsequently confirmed by demonstrating its absence in images taken after the sn has faded beyond detection . a summary of overall results to date for each sn type \n is then given (   4 ) , followed by a brief discussion of outstanding questions and areas in which future progress is likely (   5 ) . \n note that discussion is limited to what the examination of images of sn sites taken prior to the explosion has taught us , and necessarily excludes ( or relegates to very brief comment ) such related investigations as sn environments ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also the article by elias rosa in this volume ) and sn progenitor `` forensics '' ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also the article by modjaz in this volume ) . for a comprehensive discussion of all such related areas , \n see the recent review by @xcite . \n it is typical to subdivide cc  sne into at least five major categories ( see @xcite for a thorough review ) : ii - plateau ( ii - p ; hydrogen in spectrum and plateau in optical light curve ) , ii - linear ( ii - l ; hydrogen in spectrum , no plateau in optical light curve ) , iin ( hydrogen in spectrum and spectral and photometric evidence for interaction between sn ejecta and a dense circumstellar medium [ csm ] ) , iib ( hydrogen in spectrum initially , but transforms into a hydrogen - deficient spectrum at later times ) , and ib / c ( no evidence for hydrogen in spectrum at any time ) , where the ordering is a roughly increasing one in terms of inferred degree of envelope stripping prior to explosion ( i.e. , ii - p are the least stripped at the time of explosion , and ib / c are the most stripped ) . \n while most of this review focuses on the observational advances that have been made , theoretical input is critical to translate observed progenitor luminosity ( or limits ) into zero - age - main - sequence masses ( @xmath0 ) and stellar evolutionary states . among the most complete ( and accessiblestars . ] ) stellar evolution models at present are the metallicity - dependent models produced with the cambridge stellar evolution code , stars , the descendant of the code developed originally by @xcite and updated most recently by @xcite ( 2004 ; see also @xcite , and references therein ) , since they follow stellar evolution up to the initiation of core neon burning , which is likely to give an accurate indication of the pre - sn luminosity . \n the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) of the stars evolutionary tracks are shown in figure  1 for stars ranging in initial mass from @xmath1 . \n comparison with other contemporary model grids ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) show that the endpoints for stars in the @xmath2 range differ by at most @xmath3 dex in luminosity among the codes @xcite , which gives some assurance that systematic uncertainties are not great , at least at the low - mass end for red supergiant ( rsg ) stars . \n two areas of uncertainty in need of better quantification ( or , at least , agreement within the community ) include the effects that stellar rotation and mass - loss might have on the observable characteristics of stars prior to core collapse . \n not surprisingly , when no progenitor star is actually detected at the sn location in pre - sn images , only an upper limit to the progenitor s luminosity and , hence , mass , can be derived . to illustrate the analysis process in such a situation , i consider sn  2006my , an sn \n ii - p that exploded in a galaxy @xmath4 mpc away ( nearly all sne with progenitor studies are within @xmath5 mpc , since source confusion becomes an increasing problem with distance ) . \n details for this particular event are provided by @xcite ; here i briefly outline the steps my colleagues and i took to derive an upper mass limit on its progenitor .    the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) imaged the site of sn  2006my using the wide - field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in 1994 ( pre - sn ) and again in 2007 ( shortly after explosion ) . \n we registered the two images and pinpointed the sn location to better than 30 milli - arcsec in the pre - sn frame ( figure 2a , b ) . \n such fine registration allowed us to rule out a nearby point source ( source ` 1 ' in figure 2a ) as the progenitor star with greater than @xmath6 confidence . \n ( note that this source had been previously identified by @xcite as the likely progenitor based on registration with lower - resolution ground - based optical post - sn images . ) \n we next set an @xmath7-band detection limit in the pre - sn frame by placing artificial stars of progressively fainter magnitude at the sn location and letting the photometry software ( in this case , hstphot , see @xcite ) attempt to detect them . \n the point at which the software no longer detected a point source then serves as the limiting upper magnitude for the progenitor star .    to translate this single - filter detection limit into a luminosity , we assumed that the progenitor was a rsg ( given other sn  ii - p progenitor detections this seems a reasonable assumption ; see  3.2 and  4 ) , and then determined the greatest bolometric magnitude it could have had while still remaining below our detection threshold . \n this is accomplished through :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the distance modulus of the host galaxy ( ngc 4651 ) , @xmath10 the extinction to sn  2006my , @xmath7 the @xmath7-band detection threshold , @xmath11 the color range of rsg stars ( i.e. , spectral types @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 the bolometric correction corresponding to each @xmath14 . upon adopting the most conservative values for each of the parameters ( i.e. , the ones that produce the least restrictive @xmath15 for the progenitor s upper luminosity limit ) , and allowing for a maximum systematic uncertainty of 0.2 dex in the theoretical stellar model endpoints ( see   2 ) , the limiting bolometric magnitude above which any rsg would have been detected in our pre - sn image , @xmath15 , is derived . \n we then compared this with the final luminosity of stars with @xmath16 predicted by the stars stellar evolution models ( figure 2c ) to derive an upper bound on the progenitor mass of @xmath17 . from this analysis , then , we conclude that any rsg progenitor with an initial mass greater than @xmath18 would have been detected using our analysis procedure .    analyses similar to that described here for sn  2006my have been carried out on each of 22 non - detections in pre - sn images @xcite . as we shall see (   4 ) , it is the sheer number of such progenitor non - detections that permits rather strong conclusions to be drawn about cc sn progenitors from this category of progenitor studies . \n next , we consider the individually more revealing situation where an object coincident with the transformed sn location is actually detected in the pre - sn image(s ) , a situation that exists now for 11 cc sne @xcite . as an outstanding example of the analytic power provided by having multi - filter pre - sn images available ( especially in the near infrared for rsg progenitors ) , we consider the recent work of @xcite on sn  2008bk , a very nearby ( @xmath19 mpc ) sn  ii - p . in this case , \n pre - sn ground - based images in @xmath20 were registered with post - sn lgs - ao @xmath21-band images to yield solid progenitor star detections in @xmath22 , and upper luminosity limits in @xmath23 and @xmath24 . when compared with the known spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of rsg , a good match for the progenitor of sn  2008bk \n is found with a progenitor of spectral type m4i ( figure  3 ) . from comparison with the stars stellar evolutionary models an initial progenitor mass of @xmath25 \n is derived for this sn . \n similar studies on seven other detected sn  ii - p progenitors have found stars consistent with rsg in all cases , providing nice agreement between theory and observation . as we shall see in   4 , however , the _ range _ of masses inferred for these rsg progenitors is somewhat unexpected . \n finally , we consider the most satisfying situation where images taken before , during , and long after the sn explosion exist that clearly show the progenitor star , the sn , and the absence of the progenitor star , respectively . \n such a sequence provides nearly conclusive proof of the progenitor star s identity . \n currently , such a time series exists for only two objects : sn  1987a ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) and sn  2005gl @xcite . \n because the case of sn  1987a is well - known , i present sn  2005gl as the example of this situation ; it also clearly demonstrates the investigative power provided by having a third observation , long after the sn has dropped below detection . \n as shown by @xcite , early spectra of sn  2005gl exhibited the classic features of a type iin event , showing narrow but resolved lines of hydrogen superposed on an intermediate - width component on an otherwise featureless continuum . \n analysis of the spectral features indicate ejecta interacting with a dense csm , whose properties suggest that the progenitor star exploded shortly after an lbv - like mass - loss episode . comparison of a pre - sn _ hst _ image with a post - sn image obtained from the ground using the lgs - ao at the keck ii telescope established a spatial coincidence between the sn and a very bright source possessing an estimated luminosity of over @xmath26 ( @xcite ; see figures  4a and 4b ) . \n the only single stars known to possess such an extraordinary luminosity are very massive ( @xmath27 ; see figure  1 ) , which conventional theory predicts should explode only after the lbv phase has ended @xcite . \n initially , strong claims for the unexpectedly luminous progenitor / sn  2005gl association had to be tempered by consideration of the distance of sn  2005gl s host galaxy . at over 60 mpc away , the @xmath28 resolution of the pre - sn _ hst _ image corresponds to @xmath5 pc , which raises suspicion that the object could be , e.g. , an unresolved stellar cluster or association of several massive stars , with only part of the light coming from the actual progenitor of sn  2005gl @xcite . \n additional observations , therefore , were clearly needed to settle the case , and two years later , an additional _ hst _ observation was made . \n this observation demonstrates that the luminous source in the pre - sn image has , indeed , disappeared ( figure  4c ) , which implies that the progenitor of sn  2005gl was a single , extremely luminous , star that exploded while in the lbv phase @xcite . \n such a luminosity is indicative of having had an initial mass of @xmath29 , which likely left behind a stellar mass black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n in addition to exploding during an unexpected evolutionary phase , the very fact _ that _ such a massive star is demonstrated to have exploded at all  as opposed to directly collapsing to a black hole with no sn explosion  is important , since the optical signature produced at the time of stellar collapse to a black hole is , at present , virtually unconstrained by either observation or theory ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . \n the three examples discussed in   3 serve to illustrate how the science of seeking progenitors in pre - sn images is carried out , and what conclusions can typically be drawn . \n i now briefly summarize results to date arising from direct progenitor searches in pre - sn images ; for a more comprehensive review , see @xcite . \n * type ii - plateau : * sne  ii - p are by far the most well - defined category of cc sne in terms of direct observational progenitor constraints , having had eight putative progenitor detections made and 12 upper luminosity limits established . \n all of the available evidence suggests that rsg are the immediate progenitors of sne  ii - p . by employing a uniform reduction and analysis procedure , \n @xcite has produced the cumulative frequency distribution shown in figure  5 for sne  ii - p , from which an intriguing result is immediately evident : all but one of the sne  ii - p have initial masses constrained to be @xmath30 , with the most massive _ detected _ progenitor of an sn  ii - p having a mass of only @xmath31 . \n this is surprising , since rsg up to @xmath32 are clearly observed in the local group ( * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) , and would have easily been detected in the pre - sn images . \n this lack of massive rsg progenitors for sne ii - p lead @xcite to speculate that these massive rsg progenitors may be forming black holes heralded by faint , or non - existent , sn explosions ( see also * ? ? ? \n * type ii - linear : * a rare type of cc sn , it is perhaps not surprising that only one sn  ii - l ( sn  1980k ) has a pre - sn image , the analysis of which rules out massive rsg greater than about @xmath33 @xcite . \n analysis of the stellar population of the type ii - l sn  1979c by @xcite determines a mass range of @xmath34 for its progenitor . at this point , \n firm conclusions about the progenitors of sne  ii - l can not be made , although early indications are that at least some do not arise from extremely massive stars . \n * type iin : * sn  2005gl , described earlier in this review (   3.3 ) as having a very massive ( @xmath27 ) progenitor that exploded while in the lbv phase , is the only example of an sn  iin for which a progenitor has been detected in pre - sn images . \n whether such a massive progenitor is indicative of the class as a whole is not known . \n * type iib : * pre - sn images exist for two events . \n first , sn  1993j in m81 , where extensive analyses of pre - sn and post - sn images ( and spectra ) lead to the conclusion that a @xmath35 star exploded in a binary system , with a slightly less massive secondary surviving the explosion ( * ? ? ? \n * and references therein ) . \n very recently , the type iib sn  2008ax has provided a great opportunity to further investigate this rare class of cc sne since pre - sn _ \n hst_/wfpc2 images exist in @xmath36 . \n a study by @xcite finds a curiously flat sed for the progenitor star , which is impossible to reconcile with a single rsg , but may be consistent with an early - type w - r ( wn class ) progenitor , suggesting a progenitor star with a large ( @xmath37 ) initial mass . \n * type ib / c : * a well - studied class , with ten upper limits but no detections from analysis of pre - sn images . \n the lack of detections is surprising , since it is commonly thought that at least some of the progenitors of sne  ib / c should be luminous , single w - r stars , in addition to others perhaps arising from lower mass stars in binary systems . while none of the non - detections definitively rule out a w - r progenitor \n , @xcite demonstrates that it is quite unlikely at this point that all sne  ib / c come from them . \n a summary of the current state of affairs of cc sn progenitor research via studies of pre - sn images is provided by figure  6 . \n the science of seeking sn progenitors has made tremendous strides in just the last ten years . for the future , \n i look with particular interest at the extremes as areas ripe for breakthrough discoveries , since it is there that many of our most fundamental questions lie . on the low - mass end , how will the lack of massive rsg progenitors for sne  ii - p be resolved ? \n are we seeing the first glimpse of the mass cutoff for direct collapse to black holes ? \n if so , then how will this be reconciled with the _ very _ massive stars ( i.e. , the other mass extreme ) that apparently do explode as sne  iin or possibly iib ? and finally , how does binarity influence all of these conclusions ? \n clearly , we are just at the beginning stages of this exciting field of research , and great advances will no doubt be made in the coming decade . \n i thank the scientific organizing committee of the `` hot and cool : bridging gaps in massive star evolution '' conference for inviting me to provide this review . \n i thank seppo mattila for permitting reproduction of a figure from a recent paper , and stephen smartt for allowing the use of figures in advance of publication of his annual reviews article on the topic .",
        "abstract": "Observations of pre-supernova images reveal insights into core-collapse supernova progenitors. High-resolution imaging has enabled direct identification or luminosity constraints of nearly three dozen progenitors, supporting stellar evolution models. Type II-Plateau supernovae originate from red supergiants, while rare types like SN 2005gl exhibit massive luminous progenitors in unexpected phases. Analytical techniques and comparisons with models advance understanding of progenitor masses, evolutionary stages, and explosion mechanisms. Outstanding questions include the fate of massive stars and the role of binarity in progenitor evolution. This field promises significant discoveries in the coming decade."

        "article": "single - transverse spin asymmetries ( ssas ) play a fundamental role for our understanding of qcd in high - energy hadronic scattering . \n they may be obtained for reactions in , for example , lepton - proton or proton - proton scattering with one transversely polarized initial proton , by dividing the difference of the cross sections for the two settings of the transverse polarization by their sum . \n there have been extensive experimental investigations of such asymmetries  @xcite . \n these have initiated much theoretical progress , in particular within the last few years . \n a particular focus has been on a class of single - spin observables that are characterized by a large momentum scale @xmath1 ( for example , the virtuality of the photon in deeply - inelastic scattering ( dis ) ) and by a much smaller , but also measured , transverse momentum @xmath2 . \n in such a `` two - scale '' situation , single - spin asymmetries may arise at leading power , that is , not suppressed by an inverse power of @xmath1 . for some of these cases , \n factorization theorems have been established  @xcite that allow to write the spin - dependent cross sections in terms of parton distribution functions and/or fragmentation functions , perturbative hard - scattering functions , and so - called soft factors . \n a crucial feature is that the distribution functions and the soft factor in this factorization are not integrated over the transverse momenta of partons , because these in fact generate the observed transverse momentum @xmath2 . among other things \n , the observables may therefore provide valuable insights into the dependence of parton distributions in nucleons on transverse momentum . \n this becomes particularly interesting when the nucleon is transversely polarized , because there may be correlations between the nucleon spin vector , its momentum , and the parton s transverse momentum . \n one particular correlation , known as the `` sivers effect '' and described by so - called `` sivers functions ''  @xcite , is now widely believed to be involved in a variety of observed hadronic single - spin phenomena . \n closer theoretical studies have revealed that the sivers effect plays an important role in qcd , beyond giving rise to phenomenological functions to be used in the description of single - spin asymmetries . \n a particularly interesting feature is that the sivers effect is not universal in the usual sense , that is , it is not represented by universal probability functions convoluted with partonic hard - scattering cross sections . \n this might at first sight appear to make the study of these functions less interesting . \n however , the non - universality has in fact a clear physical origin , and its closer investigation has turned out to be an extremely important and productive development in qcd . in a nutshell , in order not to be forced to vanish because of the time - reversal symmetry of qcd , single - spin asymmetries require the presence of a strong - interaction phase . for the sivers functions this phase originates from the `` gauge links '' in their definition  @xcite , which are path - ordered exponentials of the gluon field that make the functions gauge - invariant . in dis \n , the gauge link may be viewed as a rescattering of the parton in the color field of the nucleon remnant . that such a final - state rescattering may generate the phase required for a nonzero ssa in semi - inclusive hadron production in dis ( sidis ) was first discovered within a model calculation  @xcite . \n depending on the hard - scattering process , the `` rescattering '' will however manifest itself in different ways . \n for example , for drell - yan lepton pair production in hadronic scattering , _ initial - state _ , rather than final - state , interactions are relevant . as a result , the phase provided by the gauge links is opposite , and the sivers functions for the drell - yan process have opposite sign  @xcite . in more general terms , \n the nontrivial  universality \" property of the sivers functions is the direct consequence of gauge interactions in quantum chromodynamics  @xcite , and of the qcd factorization theorems applying to the relevant hard processes  @xcite . \n it is a remarkable and fundamental qcd prediction that really tests all concepts we know of for analyzing hard - scattering reactions in strong interactions , and it awaits experimental verification .    while measurements of ssas in sidis are now maturing and have established the presence of sivers - type contributions  @xcite , it will still be a while until precise single - spin measurements in the relatively rare drell - yan process will become feasible at rhic  @xcite or elsewhere  @xcite . however , there are of course other hard - scattering reactions in hadronic collisions for which single - transverse spin asymmetries may be defined , and that may potentially be used in lieu of the drell - yan process for testing the nontrivial \n universality \" properties of the sivers functions . in @xcite , it was proposed to use the ssa in azimuthal correlations of two jets produced in @xmath0 collisions at rhic to learn about the sivers functions . to a first approximation , \n such dijets are produced by @xmath3 partonic qcd hard - scattering . \n with collinear kinematics , the jets are exactly `` back - to - back '' in the plane perpendicular to the initial beam directions and thus separated by @xmath4 in azimuthal angle in this plane . \n partonic transverse momenta will generate deviations from this topology , because they will lead on average to a non - vanishing net transverse momentum @xmath2 of the jet pair , much smaller than each of the jet transverse momenta @xmath5 individually . \n the observable is therefore of the `` two - scale '' type described above , and as was shown in @xcite , if one proton is polarized , a single - spin asymmetry may be defined that is in principle sensitive to the sivers functions . as \n a caveat , factorization of the spin - dependent cross section for this observable in terms of transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) functions still remains to be established .    unlike the relatively simple cases of sidis and the drell - yan process , where either final - state or initial - state interactions contribute to the sivers asymmetry , both are present for dijet production @xcite \n this complicates the analysis of the process - dependence of the sivers functions considerably , but at the same time it also makes it much more interesting from a theoretical point of view , because the interactions in this case are `` truly qcd '' , that is , they involve the detailed gauge structure of the theory , including for example its non - abelian nature . at the time of @xcite , \n the process - dependence had not yet been worked out for the case of the ssa in dijet production , so that phenomenological predictions had to remain qualitative , at best . over the last year \n , however , there has been extensive work on deriving and clarifying the structure of the gauge links for this and related processes in @xmath0 collisions @xcite . \n indeed , the resulting structure is far more complicated than that in sidis or the drell - yan process . \n however , it turns out that if one takes a certain weighted integral ( `` moment '' ) of the asymmetry , remarkable simplifications occur . \n this moment is defined by integrating the spin - dependent cross section with a factor @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the azimuthal imbalance between the two jets ( @xmath8 if the jets are exactly back - to - back in azimuth ) . for each of the various contributing @xmath3 partonic channels , \n the gauge link then essentially collapses into a set of simple color factors that multiply contributions from color - gauge invariant subamplitudes to the given partonic process . \n one may , in fact , for convenience choose to absorb these factors into the hard - scattering functions , and _ define _ the sivers functions as the functions measured in the ssa in sidis . in this way , the net effect of the gauge links on the @xmath6-moment of the spin - dependent cross section is to generate new partonic hard - scattering functions that are different from the usual spin - independent ones , but that are actually similarly simple in structure .    at the same time , taking the moment of the factorized spin - dependent cross section leads to a new expression that involves only a certain moment of the sivers functions in partonic transverse momentum @xmath9 , rather than the fully transverse - momentum dependent functions themselves . as was shown in  @xcite , these @xmath9-moments of the sivers functions are directly related to twist - three quark - gluon correlation functions first introduced in  @xcite to describe the ssa for single - inclusive hadron production in hadronic scattering . by now , quite some knowledge about these correlation functions has been gathered from phenomenological studies  @xcite of the corresponding data . \n the upshot of all this is that it has now become possible for the first time to make predictions for the @xmath6-moment of the single - transverse spin asymmetry in dijet production at rhic that correctly take into account the process - dependence of the sivers functions and incorporate phenomenological information on some properties of the functions that is available from other measurements . \n this is the goal of this note . \n we study azimuthal correlations of two jets produced nearly `` back - to - back '' in a hadronic collision . \n more specifically , we are interested in situations in which the sum of the two jet transverse momenta , @xmath10 ( or a component or projection thereof ) , is measured and small , while both individual jet transverse momenta are large and similar . \n we will therefore approximate @xmath11 wherever possible . \n for the lengths of these momentum vectors we will simply write @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the differential cross section for the process with one transversely polarized hadron contains terms of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a unit vector in the direction of the polarized proton \n , @xmath16 is the transverse spin vector of the polarized proton , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the pseudo - rapidities of the two jets . \n the first term in eq . \n ( [ sigma ] ) represents the unpolarized ( or spin - averaged ) cross section , while the second term is the single - transverse - spin dependent one . \n we note that the angular dependence of the spin - dependent term is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the so - called bisector - angle of the two jets , which ( approximately ) corresponds to the direction of @xmath21 . for this reason one may also choose to integrate the six - fold differential cross section in eq . \n ( [ sigma ] ) over @xmath22 , keeping @xmath21 fixed .    as a generalization of the sidis and drell - yan cases @xcite , we can write down a factorization formula for the differential cross section at small imbalance ( @xmath23 ) of the jets , in terms of tmd parton distributions , soft factors , and hard - scattering functions  @xcite . \n we remind the reader that such a factorization still remains to be proven . in this paper \n , we will not discuss the details of factorization issues related to the dijet correlations . as we mentioned above \n , significant simplifications occur when the imbalance of the two jets is integrated out by taking certain moments . \n for example , integrating the spin - independent differential cross section over all @xmath21 , its expression reverts to the standard collinear factorization formula for dijet production , @xmath24 where the @xmath25 denote the usual collinear ( light - cone ) parton distribution functions for parton type @xmath26 . \n we have assumed here that these are recovered by integration of the corresponding tmd distribution functions over all partonic transverse momentum , and we disregard the renormalization properties of the operators defining these distributions and the scale dependence introduced by renormalization . \n however , all these effects can be systematically included accordingly . \n the factors @xmath27 in eq . \n ( [ jeteq ] ) are the customary hard - scattering cross sections @xmath28 for the partonic processes @xmath29 ( for a compilation , see , for example , ref . \n they are functions of the partonic mandelstam variables , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , with obvious notation of the parton momenta . in terms of the hadronic center - of - mass energy @xmath33 and the jet transverse momenta and pseudo - rapidities \n , one has @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where the partonic momentum fractions are fixed by @xmath37 , @xmath38 . \n next we turn to the single - transverse - spin dependent differential cross section @xmath39 in eq . \n ( [ sigma ] ) , which can be further simplified by taking a moment in @xmath40 where @xmath41 measures how far the two jets are away from the back - to - back configuration . within our approximations \n , the weight @xmath42 corresponds to a weight in @xmath2 . \n one finds  @xcite : @xmath43 & = & \\vert \\vec s_\\perp\\vert   \\sum_{ab } x_a\\,\\frac{-1}{m_p}\\,gt_{f\\,a}(x_a)\\,x_bf_b(x_b ) \\,h_{ab\\to cd}^{\\rm sivers}(\\hat{s},\\hat{t},\\hat{u})\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the proton mass , @xmath45 is the strong coupling constant and the @xmath46 are the qiu - sterman matrix elements or quark - gluon correlation functions @xcite , defined as @xmath47 with the quark fields @xmath48 ( for flavor @xmath49 ) and the gluon field strength tensor @xmath50 . \n the @xmath46 matrix elements enter because they are related to the @xmath9-moment of the ( sidis ) sivers function for quark flavor @xmath49 @xcite , that is , @xmath51 . \n we note that there could also be contributions by purely gluonic `` @xmath52 '' correlation functions . \n these will be ignored for now , so that the label @xmath49 in eq . \n ( [ qtmp ] ) runs only over quarks and anti - quarks . \n furthermore , there is actually a second contribution to the single - transverse - spin dependent cross section , which involves the scattering of transversely polarized quarks from both the polarized proton ( transversity distribution , @xmath53 or @xmath54 ) and from the unpolarized proton ( boer - mulders function @xmath55  @xcite ) . \n the latter functions are also effects of initial- and final - state interactions and appear in a matrix element for unpolarized protons similar to eq .  . \n like the sivers - type `` @xmath52 '' correlation functions , we will also ignore the contributions associated with the boer - mulders functions in the present study , even though a future more detailed analysis of forthcoming experimental data may well require to take all of these into account . \n we now use the above formulas to obtain some predictions for the ssa in dijet - production at rhic . \n a ssa for our @xmath59-moment ( i.e. @xmath60-moment ) can be defined as ( from now on we choose @xmath61 ) @xmath62 the quark - gluon correlation functions @xmath63 have recently been fitted  @xcite to data  @xcite for the ssa in single - inclusive hadron production in hadronic collisions . \n two sets of @xmath63 were presented in  @xcite . for definiteness , \n we choose set  i , which is a two - flavor fit with valence @xmath64 and @xmath65-quark @xmath66 distributions only . \n for these the following parameterizations were obtained in  @xcite : @xmath67 where the @xmath68 are the corresponding unpolarized valence quark distributions . for the latter , as for all other unpolarized parton distributions we need , \n we choose the cteq5l parameterizations @xcite . \n we plot the resulting weighted asymmetry in fig . \n the kinematics are chosen to correspond to current measurements at star : both jets have transverse momenta @xmath69 and pseudo - rapidities @xmath70 . \n the asymmetry is plotted as a function of the sum of the two jet pseudo - rapidities . \n we have chosen the hard scale @xmath71 in the strong coupling constant and the unpolarized parton distributions .    for comparison , we also show in fig . \n [ fig1 ] the asymmetries that one would have expected if the sivers functions relevant for dijet production were identical to the ones in sidis or the drell - yan process . in the framework of our present calculation , \n the corresponding partonic hard - scattering functions would in this case be identical to the spin - averaged functions @xmath72 , or to their negatives . \n the dotted - dashed lines in the right panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] represent these cases . \n they essentially correspond to the earlier predictions of  @xcite and  @xcite that were made when the process - dependence of the sivers functions had not yet been worked out for the dijet case . \n one can see that when the correct process - dependence is incorporated , the asymmetry overall becomes smaller by about a factor two , which can be traced back to the color factors for the dominant subprocess @xmath73 . \n the sign is identical to the case when the sivers functions for dijet production are assumed to be `` dis - like '' , implying that in a sense final - state interactions dominate over initial - state ones .    in principle \n , one might verify experimentally the process - dependence of the sivers functions by discriminating between the various curves in fig . \n [ fig1 ] and confirming the qcd - predicted result shown by the solid line . in practice \n , this may require good knowledge of the @xmath66 distributions , and an understanding of issues like scale evolution and higher - order corrections . \n a closer analysis reveals that the asymmetry in fig . \n [ fig1 ] is the result of rather significant cancellations between contributions of opposite signs by @xmath64 and @xmath65 quarks . to show this \n , we display their individual contributions separately in the left panel of fig . \n [ fig1 ] .    -0.4 \n cm    we finally also briefly discuss a related type of ssa in dijet production at rhic . in @xcite , \n a differently weighted ssa was considered , defined in the following way : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the sign function . \n this asymmetry has the property that the weight only depends on the azimuthal separation of the two jets , but not on their transverse momenta . \n this may be an advantage for experimental measurements when the jet energy scale is not precisely known . when applied to the tmd factorized expression for the spin - dependent cross section , the moment defined in eq . \n ( [ sign ] ) leads to an expression different from  ( [ qtmp ] ) . \n one finds in fact that in general the transverse - momentum dependences of the various functions do not completely decouple anymore , so that the final result can in general no longer be expressed in terms of only functions of light - cone momentum fractions . \n if one assumes for simplicity  @xcite , however , that the only relevant dependence on transverse momentum resides in the sivers functions , the resulting expression again resembles a collinearly - factorized one : @xmath76 where the @xmath77 are the so - called `` @xmath78-moments '' of the sivers functions for sidis and are defined as @xmath79 in the above equations , we have used the notation `` @xmath80 '' for the sivers function for quark flavor @xmath49 ; its definition is identical to that in @xcite : @xmath81 . in  @xcite \n , the hard - scattering functions were chosen to be the same as the spin - averaged ones , with opposite sign . in light of the above discussions , \n one now would like to update the predictions for the asymmetry in  ( [ eqan ] ) . \n we will use the @xmath56 given in eqs . \n ( [ hsivers ] ) . \n we note that it remains to be established that the same @xmath56 do contribute in this case . \n this is not a priori clear , because the general gauge link structure is very complex in the general tmd case , and it has so far only been demonstrated that the @xmath56 apply when the @xmath6 moment is taken . for \n now , we just conjecture that use of the @xmath56 of  @xcite is justified in this case ; a closer discussion of this issue is left for future work  @xcite . \n the 1/2-moments of the quark sivers functions were determined in  @xcite by a fit to the hermes data  @xcite for the sivers - type single - spin asymmetry : @xmath82 these results correspond to set  ii presented in  @xcite . in fig . \n [ fig2 ] , we show predictions for the asymmetry for the dijet - correlation defined in  ( [ eqan ] ) at rhic , based on this parameterization . we find that the asymmetry shares many features with the one shown for the @xmath59-moment in fig . \n we note that first preliminary experimental data for this asymmetry have now been presented by star  @xcite , which are so far consistent with a vanishing asymmetry .    -0.4 \n in summary , we have studied single - transverse spin asymmetries in dijet - correlations at rhic , making use of the recently derived partonic hard - scattering cross sections that properly incorporate the initial- and final - state interactions , and of distribution functions fitted to existing data for single - spin asymmetries . \n we have found that the initial- and final - state interactions tend to decrease the magnitude of the asymmetry at rhic with respect to earlier estimates that assumed the sivers functions for this observable to be identical to the sivers functions in sidis or the drell - yan process . \n overall , the resulting asymmetries turn out to be more dominated by the final - state interactions , and hence more `` dis - like '' .    with experimental data on dijet single - spin asymmetries now forthcoming , it will be interesting to perform detailed comparisons with the theoretical expectations . \n other observables , such as the ssas in dihadron production @xmath83 or in photon - plus - jet production @xmath84 , will also be extremely interesting \n . it will be important to further develop the theoretical framework for all these observables , by addressing issues like tmd factorization , higher orders , soft factors , and sudakov suppression , in particular . \n * acknowledgments . * \n we thank jan balewski and steve vigdor for valuable communications about the recent star measurements and the future prospects . \n we are also grateful to daniel boer and jianwei qiu for discussions . \n are grateful to riken , brookhaven national laboratory and the u.s . \n department of energy ( contract number de - ac02 - 98ch10886 ) for providing the facilities essential for the completion of their work . \n this work has benefited from the research program of the eu integrated infrastructure initiative hadron physics ( rii3-ct-2004 - 506078 ) . \n the work of c.b . is supported by the foundation for fundamental research of matter ( fom ) and the national organization for scientific research ( nwo ) .    for fixed - target ssa data , \n see for example : d.  l.  adams _ et al . \n _ [ e581 and e704 collaborations ] , phys \n .  lett . \n b * 261 * , 201 ( 1991 ) ;

        "abstract": "This study explores single-transverse spin asymmetries (SSAs) in azimuthal correlations of nearly back-to-back jets in proton-proton collisions at RHIC. By incorporating initial- and final-state interactions in QCD, the analysis refines predictions for SSAs using fitted distribution functions from existing data. It highlights the role of Sivers functions, their process dependence, and contributions to spin-dependent effects. These predictions, focusing on weighted asymmetries, provide a testable framework for advancing understanding of QCD spin dynamics in experimental settings."

        "article": "kingman s coalescent is a random tree introduced by @xcite as the genealogy arising in large population genetic models . \n it has infinitely many leaves and is usually constructed from leaves to the root as follows : given that there are @xmath7 lines in the tree , after some exponential time with rate @xmath8 , two lines are chosen uniformly and merged to one line , leaving the tree with @xmath9 lines . due to the quadratic rate @xmath10 the tree immediately comes down from infinitely to finitely many leaves @xcite . since the seminal paper by @xcite this random tree has been generalized to other infinite trees arising in population genetics models .    for the kingman \n coalescent some laws of large numbers and central limit theorems have been proved . \n they are nicely summarized in @xcite , chapter  4.2 ; see also proposition  [ p:11 ] below . for @xmath11 \n let @xmath12 denote the number of lines time @xmath13 in the past . \n then , since the kingman coalescent immediately comes down from infinity , @xmath12 is finite . \n furthermore it is approximately @xmath14 . \n equivalently , the time @xmath0 it takes the coalescent to go from infinitely many lines to @xmath1 lines is approximately @xmath15 for large @xmath1 . \n going to the fine structure , at time @xmath0 the infinite population is decomposed in @xmath1 families ( whose joint distribution is exchangeable ) and every leaf in the tree belongs to exactly one of the @xmath1 families whose frequencies are denoted by @xmath16 . \n it is known that for large @xmath1 a randomly chosen @xmath3 is approximately exponentially distributed with mean @xmath17 . \n this translates into several laws of large numbers ; see e.g.  ( 35 ) in @xcite . \n in particular the probability of picking ( from the initial infinite population ) two leaves that belong to the same family , given by @xmath18 , is approximately @xmath15 .    the main goal of the present paper is to study the corresponding large deviations results . to the best of our knowledge , except for @xcite , cf . \n remark  [ rem : angel ] , results in this direction are not present in the literature . \n we formulate our results in the next section . \n theorem  [ t1 ] gives a full large deviation principle for the distributions of @xmath19 . \n the proof , given in section  [ sec : proofs1 ] , is an application of the grtner -

theorem - reft2 ] . for the upward deviations we use a variant of cramr s theorem for heavy - tailed random variables \n ; see e.g.  @xcite . for the downward deviations we use a connection to self - normalized large deviations ; see @xcite . \n this connection was pointed out to us by alain rouault and nina gantert . \n since the rate function for downward deviations is hard to treat analytically we provide in theorem  [ t3 ] a simple lower bound . \n the proof of that bound is given in section  [ sec : proof - theorem3 ] . \n the kingman coalescent can be seen as a discrete graph , more precisely a discrete tree with infinitely many leaves . \n let @xmath22 be independent exponentially distributed variables with mean @xmath23 . \n then the kingman coalescent tree can be constructed from the root to the leaves as follows .    1 . \n start the tree with two lines from the root . \n 2 .   for @xmath24 \n the tree stays with @xmath7 lines for the amount of time @xmath25 . \n after that time one of the @xmath7 lines is randomly chosen . \n this line splits in two so that the number of lines jumps from @xmath7 to @xmath26 . \n 3 .   stop upon reaching infinitely many lines , which happens after ( the almost surely finite ) time @xmath27 . \n the random variable @xmath28 is the total tree height . \n alternatively , @xmath28 is the time to the most recent common ancestor ( mrca ) of the infinite population ( of leaves ) . counted from the top of the tree at time @xmath29 a random number @xmath12 of active lines in the kingman tree is present , i.e.@xmath30 at time @xmath0 every leaf belongs to one of @xmath1 disjoint families and all members of each such family stem from the same line at time @xmath0 . \n let us denote the frequencies of these families ( which exist due to exchangeability by definetti s theorem ) by @xmath16 . \n the following results are well known ( see @xcite for   and and @xcite for ; proofs can also be found in @xcite . )     + let [ p:11 ] @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 be as above . \n then @xmath34    we [ rem : interllnfe ] note that the left hand side of has the interpretation of a _ \n homozygosity by descent _ in the following sense : when picking two leaves from the tree at time @xmath35 , the probability that both share a common ancestor at time @xmath0 is @xmath36 . \n then , the law of large number states that the homozygosity by descent at time @xmath0 is approximately @xmath15 for large @xmath1 .    in the present paper \n we are interested in large deviations results corresponding to the statements of proposition  [ p:11 ] . \n we start with large deviations connected with . \n first we introduce some notation . for @xmath37 let @xmath38 denote the distribution of @xmath19 , \n i.e.  @xmath39 . \n furthermore we denote by @xmath40 the borel @xmath41-algebra on @xmath42 and for @xmath43 we denote by @xmath44 the _ interior _ and by @xmath45 the _ closure _ of @xmath46 . for @xmath47 , \n let @xmath48 be the unique solution of the equation @xmath49 , where the continuous and increasing function @xmath50 is defined by ( see figure  [ fig : t1 ] for a plot ) @xmath51      2 & : \\ ; t=0 , \\\\[2ex ]      \\displaystyle\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{|t|}}\\arctan\\sqrt{|t| } & : \\ ; t < 0 . \n \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the proof of the following theorem is given in section  [ sec : proof -

coroll - refc ] ; see figure  [ fig : cor1 ] for a plot of the rate function @xmath84 .    for @xmath85 \n the family @xmath86 [ cor : tnt ] satisfies a large deviation principle with scale @xmath87 and good rate function @xmath84 given by @xmath88 \\displaystyle        \\frac{\\pi^2}{2 } & : \\ ,   x=0 , \\\\[1.5ex ]        \\infty & : \\ , x<0 ,      \\end{cases }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath53 from  . \n in particular , for @xmath89 we have @xmath90     from corollary  [ cor : tnt ] . \n the figure on the right is a comparison of @xmath84 with the lower bound obtained from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   from corollary  [ cor : tnt ] . \n the figure on the right is a comparison of @xmath84 with the lower bound obtained from @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    the distributions @xmath91 ( as well as @xmath92 ) have been described explicitely in the literature . \n @xcite , section 6 , gives @xmath93 in principle , this formula must also give the large deviations for the measures @xmath81 , but this does not seem straight - forward .    although [ rem : angel ] the main goal of  @xcite was the analysis of spatial @xmath94-coalescents , they also provide some large deviations bounds on kingman s coalescent . \n these bounds are mainly based on markov inequality . \n precisely , in lemma 2.2 in @xcite it is shown that for @xmath95 @xmath96 and therefore @xmath97 in the neighbourhood of @xmath98 the last inequality translates easily into a bound for the rate function @xmath84 from ; see figure  [ fig : cor1 ] . \n namely , for @xmath99 we have @xmath100    next , we state some large deviations results connected to  . for @xmath101 we know from   that @xmath102 holds almost surely . \n the proof of this result is based on the well - known fact ( see e.g.  section  5 in @xcite ) that the distribution of @xmath103 can be derived using uniform order statistics : let @xmath104 be independent and uniformly distributed on @xmath105 $ ] , and @xmath106 be their order statistics . \n additionally , let @xmath107 be independent exponentially distributed random variables with mean @xmath23 . then , @xmath108 here the second equality in distribution is one of the well known representations of uniform spacings ; see e.g.  section  4.1 in @xcite . \n it follows @xmath109 we will use this representation to obtain large deviations results for @xmath103 . in particular \n we show that upwards large deviations of @xmath103 are on the scale @xmath6 while downwards large deviations are on the scale @xmath1 . the proof is given in section  [ sec : proof - theorem - reft2 ] .    for [ t2 ] \n each @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 furthermore @xmath112 and for each @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 the function @xmath115 is positive for @xmath116 and is given by @xmath117 here @xmath118 is a function of the form @xmath119 with @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the distribution function of the one dimensional standard gaussian distribution . \n though the rate function in   is exact it is hard to treat analytically . for this reason we provide in theorem  [ t3 ] a much simpler lower bound for downwards large deviations of @xmath103 . for the proof we use the following lemma which provides another representation of @xmath103 in terms of exponential random variables ( see section  [ sec : proofs2 ] for proofs ) . \n let [ l : wn ] @xmath122 be independent exponentially distributed random variables with mean @xmath23 . \n then , @xmath123    for [ t3 ] @xmath124 we have @xmath125    the main point in the proof of lemma  [ l : wn ] is that @xmath103 does not depend on the order of the @xmath126 and hence we can as well order them according to their size . \n let us briefly explain how we will use in the proof of in . since @xmath103 is minimal if @xmath127 ( whence @xmath128 ) , we have to look for possibilities that all @xmath126 s are of about the same size in order to obtain a large deviations result for @xmath103 . \n let @xmath129 denote the above exponential random variables ordered in increasing order , i.e.  @xmath130 is the @xmath4th smallest value . \n using `` competing exponential clocks '' arguments ( see also the proof of the lemma ) one can see that @xmath131 is exponentially distributed with mean @xmath132 . hence , one way of obtaining similar values for all @xmath126 s arises if @xmath133 is particularly large , which then leads to a large deviations result for @xmath103 .     from in theorem  [ t2 ] and the lower bound from in theorem  [ t3].,width=226 ]    \\1 . \n let us give some heuristics about the rates arising in theorem  [ t2 ] . for , we have to ask ourselves about the easiest way @xmath103 \n becomes too large . from \n , we see that this is the case if one of the @xmath126 s is too large , making this kind of deviations a local property in the sense that only a single of the @xmath126 s has to show some untypical behavior . \n this is different when looking at , i.e.  too small values of @xmath103 . \n first , observe that @xmath103 is small only if all ( or many ) families have about equal sizes ( extreme case @xmath134 gives the minimal value @xmath128 ) . \n hence , such downward deviations require to study a global property of the random variable @xmath103 , which is significantly harder . \n for the proof of we will interpret @xmath103 as a self - normalised sum and use from @xcite a result on large deviations result for such sums .    \\2 . from \n , we see that in fact @xmath103 is a function of uniform order statistics , which , for instance , have been studied in detail ( although no large deviations results were given ) in @xcite . \n hence , theorem  [ t2 ] may as well be interpreted as a large deviations result for uniform order statistics .    \\3 . \n as stated in remark  [ rem : interllnfe ] , @xmath135 can be interpreted as homozygosity at time @xmath0 . using a poisson process along the tree with intensity @xmath136 , we can ask for the probability of picking two leaves from the tree which are not separated by a poisson mark , denoted by _ homozygosity in state _ , abbreviated by @xmath137 . this quantity is closely related to the poisson - dirichlet distribution and some large deviations ( in the limit of large @xmath138 ) \n were derived in @xcite . \n it is shown there in theorem  5.1 that @xmath139 and that @xmath140 for @xmath141 . however , a large deviation principle for the quantity @xmath142 ( noting that @xmath143 ) , which corresponds to the results from theorem  [ t2 ] , could not be obtained by @xcite . at least , it was shown that its scale can not be larger than @xmath144 . \n the proof of theorem  [ t1 ] is an application of the grtner -

        "abstract": "Kingman’s coalescent models genetic ancestries as a random tree structure. Key results include two laws of large numbers: (i) the shortest distance from the tree-top to when there are \n\uD835\uDC5B\nn lines is almost \n2\n/\n\uD835\uDC5B\n2/n, and (ii) individuals partition into \n\uD835\uDC5B\nn families, with family sizes following specific distributions. This paper extends these to large deviation results, providing explicit rate functions for deviations in distances (\n\uD835\uDC42\n(\n1\n/\n\uD835\uDC5B\n)\nO(1/n)) and family size distributions (\n\uD835\uDC42\n(\n1\n/\n\uD835\uDC5B\n)\nO(1/n) for downward and \n\uD835\uDC42\n(\n1\n/\n\uD835\uDC5B\n2\n)\nO(1/n \n2\n ) for upward deviations).

        "article": "circumstellar material holds clues about the mass - loss history of massive stars . indeed , \n as the winds interact with the interstellar medium ( wind - blown bubbles , bow shocks ) , they leave a characteristic signature that depends on the wind properties . moreover , the material ejected during short eruptive phases is visible as nebulae around massive stars . \n the analysis of these features reveals which material was ejected and in which quantity . with the recent reduction in mass - loss rates , \n these episodes of enhanced mass - loss have gained more attention , as they seem more crucial than ever in the evolution of massive stars . \n another reason to study the close environment of massive stars is to better understand the evolution of supernova remnants ( snrs ) . \n indeed , the famous rings of sn1987a may only be understood if one considers the previous mass - loss episodes of the progenitor . \n morphology is not the only snr parameter which is affected , as the snr dynamics in an homogeneous medium or in winds and circumstellat ejecta is not identical .    for its study \n , the ir provides several key diagnostics . \n continuum emission in this range is provided by heated dust , which may have a range of temperatures depending of the framework ( very close hot features , large , old , and cool bubbles ) . \n in addition , ir lines probe the many phases of the material : molecules ( e.g. pahs ) for the neutral material , ionized metals for hii regions , ... \n this summary of sps5 - part iii examines each case of circumstellar environment in turn , and concludes with the potential offered by current and future facilities . \n circumstellar structures around bsgs have been predominantely identified as bow shocks around runaway stars . originally discovered with iras ( e.g. van buren & mccray , 1988 , apj , 329 , l93 ) , such structures have also been seen with msx and wise ( peri et al . \n 2012 ) . a more general survey of bsgs , i.e. not targeting runaway stars , with objects selected from crowther et al . \n ( 2006 ) and przybilla et al . \n ( 2010 ) , reveals ir material around six of the 45 targets at 22@xmath0 m with wise , also mostly in the form of bow shocks ( wachter , in prep ) . \n several examples of bipolar nebulae around bsgs are also known ( e.g. sher 25 , smartt et al . \n 2002 ; hd 168625 , smith 2007 ) . \n however , this material could have also been ejected during an lbv phase , since lbvs can exhibit bsg spectra , and we will therefore concentrate on the bow shocks . \n emission ( greyscale ) of vela x-1 with pacs 70@xmath0 m emission contours shown on top . \n _ right : _ colour composite image of bow shock of bd+43@xmath13654 ( wise 12@xmath0 m in blue , pacs 70@xmath0 m in green , and pacs 160@xmath0 m in red ) . \n the direction of proper motion is indicated by the arrow in both cases . from cox \n ( in prep.).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   emission ( greyscale ) of vela x-1 with pacs 70@xmath0 m emission contours shown on top . _ \n right : _ colour composite image of bow shock of bd+43@xmath13654 ( wise 12@xmath0 m in blue , pacs 70@xmath0 m in green , and pacs 160@xmath0 m in red ) . \n the direction of proper motion is indicated by the arrow in both cases . from cox \n ( in prep.).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    runaway stars have large stellar velocities ( above 30kms@xmath2 ) resulting from dynamical interactions in ( dense ) clusters or from a supernova explosion in a binary system . \n these stars can thus travel at supersonic speeds through the local medium giving rise to `` bow shocks '' as their stellar winds interact with the surrounding medium , which has been previously ionised by stellar photons from the hot star ( weaver 1977 ) . \n the occurrence of such bow shocks has been shown to depend primarily on the ism conditions ( huthoff & kaper 2002 ) . \n for example , even a runaway star may travel at subsonic speeds in the tenuous interior of a superbubble , where the sound speed can be as much as 100kms@xmath2 , hence no ( detectable ) bow shock will be produced in that case . \n the filling factor of ism with @xmath3kms@xmath2 is 20% and 75% of o - stars have velocities @xmath410kms@xmath2 , so the expected fraction of o - stars with bow shocks is @xmath515% . \n this is remarkably similar to the values derived from iras and wise observations ( noriega - crespo et al . \n 1997 , peri et al . \n 2012 ) . \n once formed , the size , shape and morphology of a bow shock depends on both stellar ( wind kinetic energy and stellar velocity ) and interstellar parameters ( density and temperature ) . in particular the ratio \n @xmath6 indicates whether or not instabilities are likely to develop ( dgani et al . \n 1996 ) , and the stand - off distance between the star and the apex of the shock is determined from the pressure balance between the stellar wind and the ism ( see analytical results by wilkin 1996 and simulations by e.g. comeron & kaper 1998 , blondin & koerwer 1998 ) . \n independent estimates of the wind parameters can thus be inferred from bow shocks , which serves as a useful check for atmosphere models , but the values are sensitive to the ism properties , which are not always known with precision . \n m of the dust thermal emission obtained by kervella et al . \n north is up , east to the left , and the field of view is given in the upper right corner of each image . , width=529 ]    currently , a small survey with herschel - pacs of 5 runaways with known bow - shocks is ongoing : @xmath7cam , @xmath8oph , @xmath9cma , vela x-1 and bd+43@xmath13654 ( cox et al . \n , in preparation ) . for vela x-1 , the peak emission of the dust emission is co - spatial with the most prominent h@xmath7 arc seen in the supposed direction of space motion ( fig . \n [ cox ] ) : it is concluded that the outer shock is radiative , but the inner shock is adiabatic , though some h@xmath7 emission possibly related to ( part of ) the inner termination shock is also detected . from the analysis of its \n `` puffed - up '' bow shock ( fig . \n [ cox ] ) , the mass - loss rate of bd+43@xmath13654 ( o4if ) was found to be 10@xmath10m@xmath11yr@xmath2 : this is very high ( by 2 orders of magnitude ) in view of current mass - loss rate estimates of such stars , but the exact value strongly depends on ism density , which need to be refined . \n the dust temperature , @xmath5  45  k , is compatible with heating by stellar photons only , suggesting there is no additional shock - heating of grains . \n the thickness of a bow shock ( @xmath5  1  pc ) suggests a mach number close to unity , implying a ism temperature of 10@xmath12 \n 10@xmath13  k. \n circumstellar structures on scales of a few arcseconds or less around rsgs have been revealed through interferometric techniques ( e.g. monnier et al . \n stencel et al . \n ( 1988 , 1989 ) reported the iras detection of resolved shells with typical radii of a few arcminutes around rsgs for a significant fraction ( 25% ) of their sample . \n however , higher resolution spitzer images fail to confirm several of these extended structures ( wachter , in prep ) , indicating that a systematic survey is needed to ascertain the occurrence of large scale circumstellar shells around rsgs . \n m to 192@xmath0 m . \n multitude of molecular lines have been detected . from matsuura et al . \n ( in prep.).,width=453 ]    a few ( famous ) cases have however been studied in depth . \n one of these is betelgeuse , a cool ( 3600k ) , large ( 700 r@xmath11 ) , rather massive ( 1015 m@xmath11 ) , luminous ( @xmath14 l@xmath11 ) , and nearby ( 150 pc ) star . because of its distance \n , betelgeuse can be probed on almost all scales , providing a unique panorama of stellar surroundings ( fig . \n [ betel ] ) . \n space - based and interferometric instruments ( e.g. hst , iota / ionic and vlti / pionier ) revealed the photosphere , notably the expected non - uniformities due to large convection cells . \n adaptive optics imaging in the near - ir ( e.g. naco ) and ( radio or ir ) interferometers unveiled the properties of the internal , compact molecular envelope ( 110 r@xmath15 ) . \n precursors of dust have been found there , as well as an extended `` plume '' reaching 6r@xmath15 and maybe linked to a hot spot on the photosphere . \n high - res imaging ( e.g. vlt / visir ) shows the envelope at intermediate scales ( 10100 r@xmath15 ) , where the dust forms ( a possible signature of silicates has been found ) . at these small and intermediate scales , betegeuse presents a complex circumstellar envelope ( with knots and filaments ) at all wavelengths , which implies an inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the material lost by the star . \n finally , at the largest scale , ir imagers such as herschel unveil the cool external envelope ( 100 - 10000 r@xmath15 ) , where a bow shock with the ism is detected ( cox et al . \n 2012 ) . \n m ( blue ; blue contours ) and 22 @xmath0 m ( red ; yellow contours ) of ws1 , discovered and initially characterized by gvaramadze et al . \n the contours for each band help illuminate the morphology of the nebular material , which has an overall se - nw elongation , reminiscent of bipolar structure . \n _ bottom left : _ optical photometric monitoring since discovery show both the r and i light curves have brightened by about 1 magnitude over the last year . \n arrows indicate times when same night spectroscopy were secured . _ \n right panel : _ optical spectroscopic monitoring indicates evolution to cooler temperature with near disappearance of the he i 5876 @xmath16 and 6678 @xmath16 and changes in the @xmath17 line profile . \n figures from stringfellow et al . \n ( in preparation).,width=377 ]    herschel has also probed the envelope of other red supergiants ( groenewegen et al . \n turning in particular to the case of vy cma ( matsuura et al . \n , in prep . ) \n , the potential of ir spectroscopy is obvious . \n herschel - spire reveals a rich spectrum , with a dust continuum and hundreds of lines dues to molecules ( one third linked to water , others to co , cs , sio , ... ) , which constrain the envelope s properties . \n for example , the isotopic ratio @xmath18c/@xmath19c is found to be 6.5 , in agreement with observations of other rsgs but at odds with theoretical predictions which are four times higher at least . \n very strong emission of submm molecular lines can be explained if a temperature gradient is present in the envelope , e.g. because of dust formation at a certain radius . \n because of their spectacular eruptions , lbvs are the most well - known cases of massive stars with ejecta . \n it is not yet certain , however , at what stage ( bsg ? \n after a rsg phase or not ? ) this material is ejected , and how ( multiple events ? ) . \n lbvs are rare : in the list of clark et al . \n ( 2005 ) , there are only 12 confirmed and 23 candidate lbvs . \n ir has played a key role in recent years . \n the search , through surveys like mipsgal , of round - shaped nebulae with luminous central stars resulted in the discovery of many new nebulae : 62 shells in wachter et al . \n ( 2010 ) , 115 shells and bipolar nebulae in gvaramadze et al . \n ( 2010 ) , 416 structures in mizuno et al . \n many of these nebulae are preferentially detected with spitzer 24@xmath0 m band , indicating relatively cold material . \n identifying shell - like structures is only the first step . to ascertain a clbv status , \n the central object needs to be studied spectroscopically . \n this was done for many of these new detections ( c.f . \n , gvaramadze et al . 2010 ; wachter et al . 2010 ; stringfellow et al . \n 2012a , b , and in preparation ) . \n the classification does not rely on the presence of a particular line , but rather on the morphological resemblance of the spectra to spectra of known lbvs - while not 100% perfect ( some peculiar o and wr stars display similar features ) , this method has the advantage of being simple and rather robust . \n a more definitive answer can be provided through photometric and/or spectroscopic monitorings . \n indeed , as their name indicate , lbvs should be _ \n variable_. near - simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in the optical ( and ir ) of about a dozen newly identified candidate lbvs has revealed that ws1 ( discovered by gvaramadze et al . \n 2012 ) is indeed a bona fide lbv , presently displaying what appears to be s dor type variability as shown in fig . \n [ guy ] ( stringfellow et al . 2012 , in preparation ) . \n ir is also useful in revealing details of particular objects . \n for example , a herschel survey of lbvs undertaken at lige yielded as first result a characterization of the surroundings of wray 15 - 751 ( vamvatira - nakou et al . , submitted ) . \n ir photometry can only be explained if the star evolves at constant luminosity and dust grains are fe - rich . \n images also revealed the presence of a second shell , about 4 times larger than the previously known one , which most probably results from an older eruptive event . considering both structures , there is about 0.075 m@xmath11 of dust in the system . \n ionized gas is responsible for several forbidden lines observed in the herschel - pacs range ( fig . \n [ chloi ] ) , which allow a n / o abundance of about 7 times solar and a mass of ionized gas of 12 m@xmath11 ( 20 times that of dust ) , to be derived . \n dust can be well studied in the ir , so this range may provide clues on where dust come from in galaxies . \n two examples of such feedback were presented in the session : @xmath20car and sn1987a . \n the latter was observed with herschel at 100 - 500@xmath0 m wavelengths , and 0.4 - 0.7 m@xmath11 of dust was detected - mostly silicates and amorphous carbon ( matsuura et al . \n it is thought that this dust come from the explosion , but the role played by previous mass - loss episodes , in particular the lbv phase , is not yet clear . \n for example , about 0.12 m@xmath11 of dust was detected , thanks to 30@xmath0 m minitao observations , in the famous lbv @xmath20car . \n up to 80% of that dust belonged to the torus , hence may not be related to the big 1843 event . \n only a few percentage ( 4 - 6% ) of wolf - rayet stars displays surrounding nebulosities in the wise survey , and most are found around wn stars ( wachter , in prep ) . \n the morphological classification scheme of wr nebulae proposed by chu ( 1981 ) has been revised in this meeting by guerrero et al . \n ( toal et al , in prep . ) using _ wise _ ir images and sdss or super cosmos sky survey h@xmath7 images for 35 nebulae associated with wrs . \n two _ wise _ bands were particularly used : the one at 12@xmath0 m , which encompasses pah lines and lines of low excitation ions , and that at 22@xmath0 m , to which thermal emission from dust and lines of he  i as well as high excitation ions contribute . \n three phases are defined . in the first one , \n wr nebulae appear as complete shells or bubbles . \n it corresponds to the star just entering the wr stage , when its powerful wind sweeps up the previous slow and dense winds ( from e.g. lbv or rsg stages ) . \n the second phase is the clumpy phase . at that point , \n the nebulae display knots of gas and dust connected by partial shells and arcs . \n it corresponds to an age of a few 10@xmath13yr , when instabilities break down the swept - up shell . the stellar motion through the ism has an impact on the morphology , for example one - sided arc may be sometimes seen . \n finally , the mixed nebular phase ends the cycle , with no definite morphology nor always a 1-to-1 correspondence between optical and ir images . \n it corresponds to the last stage , when the circumstellar nebula begins to dissolve into the ism . \n the close environment of massive stars is the `` missing link '' between the star itself and the large circumstellar features . \n it plays a key role in understanding the mass - loss , but it is also difficult to probe directly . \n emission lines arising in the wind and circumstellar material are a classical way to study this region , as well as near - ir excess linked to disk - like features . in this context , \n be and b[e ] stars are targets of choice , and surprises are frequent . \n for example , graus et al . ( \n 2012 ) found three new sgb[e ] in the smc : they display typical spectra , with forbidden lines , but the line strengths as well as the ir excess appear reduced compared to usual objects of this class . \n it suggests that either the disks have less material or less dust than usual , or maybe that these stars are transitional objects . \n another case intriguingly shows the opposite situation : cd@xmath2149@xmath13441 displays forbidden lines and appreciable ir excess , but is a main - sequence be star away from any star - forming region ( lee and chen 2009 ) . \n a possibility may be that this star is in fact a weak b[e ] , rather than a classical be . \n the environment close to the star can also be studied , directly , by means of interferometry , which is usually performed at long wavelengths . \n most optical / ir interferometric measurements rely on the measurements of `` visibilities '' , which are directly linked to the size of the object . \n recently , several massive stars , including nine lbvs , were observed with the vlti ( groh et al . \n , in prep . ) . \n amongst these , hd316285 ( fig . \n [ groh ] ) : the recorded visibilities implied a size of 0.002  for the source of continuum radiation , and 0.004  for the source of the br@xmath22 line . \n a cmfgen fit to the spectrum yields a stellar model with which one can estimate the wind size in ir , and it agrees well with vlti observations . \n the asymetric shape of the measured differential phases ( red vs blue side ) favors a prolate shape for the rotating star wind , but it could also be explained by clumps or binarity . since \n the latter imply in time variability , a monitoring will be needed to ascertain the exact nature of the asymmetry . \n = 0.19 , rather than 0.25 as von zeipel predicted in 1924.,width=377 ]    while visibilities provide valuable data , `` real '' images are always more impressive . \n interferometric instruments such as michigan infrared combiner ( mirc ) and pionier are beginning to provide such data . \n mirc was the first to image altair ( monnier et al . \n 2007 ) and several other rapidly rotating stars as shown in fig . \n it has also imaged circumstellar disks and multi - object systems . \n for example , the disk contribution of @xmath23sco was shown to remain stable during the periastron in 2011 ( che et al . \n 2012 ) , and the mass - exchange in the @xmath24lyr system can be clearly imaged ( zhao et al . \n 2008 ) , as well as the 3 components of algol ( baron et al . 2012 ) or the disk of the eclipsing companion of @xmath25aur ( kloppenborg et al . , 2010 ) . \n this session has demonstrated the usefulness of studies in the ir in studying the environment of massive stars . \n recent advances in this domain are notably provided by surveys , as they enable discovery of new objects to study , thereby improving the census of nebular features associated with hot stars . \n furthermore , ir diagnostics unveil the properties of these neighbouring nebulosities : morphology , temperature , composition , density are the necessary keys paving the way of a better understanding of the mass - loss in massive stars . \n yn acknowledges comments from augusto daminelli and support from fnrs and prodex herschel / xmm - integral contracts . \n nljc thanks fwo and prodex - herschel for financial support . \n jhg is supported by an ambizione fellowship of the swiss national science foundation . \n cdl has been supported financially by grant nsc-101 - 2922-i-008 - 120 of the national science council of taiwan .",
        "abstract": "The study of circumstellar environments around massive stars (e.g., supergiants, Wolf-Rayet stars, and LBVs) reveals mass-loss histories and feedback mechanisms. Infrared (IR) observations are pivotal for discovering previously unknown nebulae and analyzing their morphology, temperature, and composition. Features like bow shocks, shells, and dust emission provide insights into stellar evolution and interstellar interactions. Advances in IR technology, such as Herschel and Spitzer, are enhancing our understanding of these phenomena, helping to characterize massive stars and their surrounding environments with greater detail."
